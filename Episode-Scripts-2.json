        "script": "Tonight's the night.  And it's going to happen again and again   has to happen.  Nice night.  Miami is a great town.  I love the Cuban food.  Pork sandwiches   my favorite.  But I'm hungry for something different now.  There he is   Mike Donovan.  He's the one.  You're mine now, so do exactly as I say.    What do you want?   I want you to be quiet.  Now drive.  Turn here.  You have to listen Do what I say.    Look.    No.  Uh, yes.  No, no! It's horrible, isn't it? Isn't it? Please Open your eyes and look at what you did! Look or I'll cut your eyelids right off your face.  It took me a long time to get these little boys clean.  One of them had been in the ground so long he was falling apart.  I pulled him out in bits and pieces.  Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is   Stop! That never helped anybody.  Please, you can have anything.  That's good.  Beg.  Did these little boys beg? I couldn't help myself.  I couldn't.  I  Please, you have to understand Trust me, I definitely understand.  See, I can't help myself, either.  Children, I could never do that.  Not like you.  Never, ever kids.  Why? I have standards.  Soon you'll be packed into a few neatly wrapped hefties in my own small corner of the world.  It'll be a neater, happier place.  A better place.  My name is Dexter, Dexter Morgan.  I don't know what made me the way I am, but whatever it was left a hollow place inside.  People fake a lot of human interactions, but I feel like I fake them all, and I fake them very well.  Ahoy! Ahoy, there, captain! Any big marlin out there today? And that's my burden, I guess.  But I don't blame my foster parents for that.  Harry and Doris Morgan did a wonderful job raising me.  But they're both dead now.  I didn't kill them Honest.  You're different, aren't you, Dexter? What do you mean, pop? The Billups say Buddy disappeared.  I found the grave, son.  That dog was a noisy little creep, dad.  He was barking all night, and mom couldn't sleep.  And she's very, very sick, and that lousy dog was yapping at every leaf that blew down the sidewalk! There were a lot of bones in there, Dexter, and not just Buddy's.  Hola, Dexter! Blood  sometimes it sets my teeth on edge.  Other times, it helps me control the chaos.  The code of Harry, my foster father, is satisfied.  And so am I.  Harry was a great cop here in Miami.  He taught me how to think like one, taught me how to cover my tracks.  I'm a very neat monster.  Dexter, are you there? Okay, Dex, please, as soon as you get in, I'm at a crime scene by the shithole the Seven Seas motel, and I need you here.  Okay? Dex? Please Pretty fucking please with cheese on top.  That's my foul mouthed foster sister, Debra.  She has a big heart but won't let anyone see it.  She's the only person in the world who loves me.  I think that's nice.  I don't have feelings about anything, but if I could have feelings at all, I'd have them for Deb.  There's something strange and disarming about looking at a homicide scene in the daylight of Miami.  It makes the most grotesque killings look staged, like you're in a new and daring section of Disney World   Dahmer Land*.  You better be a cop.  No.  Forensics.  Dex! Hey, what's up? Jeez, Deb Where the hell do you keep your gun? They found another hooker, in the pool.    Another?   Chopped up in bits and pieces.    That's the third one in 5 months.    Third? You mean there's a   A serial killer, that's right.  The other 2 were in Broward, chopped up just like this one.  Any suspects? Wish I knew.  I'm on Vice, so Laguerta sent me to my room and told me to stay out of sight.  God forbids she listens to what you have to say.  Tell me about it.  How does someone so dumb get so much power? She knows how to play the game.  You could take a lesson.  In what, ass kissing? Politics.  I just want to catch this guy before he kills another one of my girls.    You can't get so emotionally invested.    You always say that.  So did dad.  Yeah, but he also said, \"go after what you want.  \" I want out of Vice and into Homicide.  What can I do to help? You get these hunches, you know, with these types of murders.    Only sometimes.    Well, see if you get one this time.  And can I bounce some ideas off of you later? You know I always get smarter when I'm talking to you.  You just need a little more confidence.  All right, I'll take a look.  In the meantime, avoid Laguerta and talk to Captain Matthews.  He and dad were tight.  Maybe he'll put you on the case.  You're making me smarter already, see? And keep the sex suit on when you talk to the Captain.  It'll help your cause.    That's a nice haircut, Masuoka.    Saw your sister.    Damn, looking hot.    Yeah, she should.  It's hot as hell out here.  So Why are you here?   It's a crime scene.    Yeah.    But you do blood spatter.    So? So? There's no blood here.    What was that?   Yeah.  There's no blood in or on or near the body at all.  It's the weirdest thing you ever saw.  Hey, Angel, let's show him.  No blood.  No sticky, hot, messy, awful blood.  No blood at all.  Why hadn't I thought of that? No blood.  What a beautiful idea! How is he doing? How does the killer get rid of the blood? It's hard to say.  The body's in good shape.  She got a nice ass, too.  Head is over there, if you want to take a look.    This is unique.    No shit.  And no prints, either.  I've never seen such clean, dry, neat looking dead flesh.  Wonderful.  Very clean.  Yeah, but he didn't finish.  No termin\u00f3.    It looks pretty completo to me, Angel.    No, no.  Look.  He cut the leg in four pieces, almost like using a ruler.  But this leg is in three pieces.  Now, look, he started to make a fourth cut but stopped.    It's possible he got interrupted.    Laguerta's looking for a witness, working on the motel porter back there.  God help him.  No blood.  I can't think.  I have to get out of here.  Dex, \u00bfd\u00f3nde va? Where are you going? Hey, no blood No trabajo.  I wish she'd stop that.  It's one of those mating rituals which I really don't understand.  But that bloodless body   this guy may have exceeded my own abilities.    Morning, Dex.    Morning.    Hey, Dex.    Hey, Sue.  Dan.    How are the families?   Good.  You?   See you at the next bloodbath?   Never miss a party.  Thanks.  Salt of the earth, these people, and they work hard.  But with the solve rate for murders at about 20%, Miami is a great place for me, a great place for me to hone my craft.  Viva Miami.  Dex.    I like your other outfit better.    You're a sick bastard.  Guess what.  Sex suit worked.  Captain put me on the case.  Laguerta wasn't happy, but she needs to get laid.    I guess.  So congrats!   So you got any ideas yet? Nope.  Well, start working on your mental autopsy 'cause I could use your theories.  And thanks for the fucking doughnut.  I got to go.  Doughnut? You keeping your fingernails clean? Never leave home without my rubber gloves.  Good boy.  So, anything new? One of these days you're gonna tell me.  I already told you.  Blood spatter doesn't take up all my time.  I like doing it.  Maybe I can help out.  It fills my nights.    You have a morbid sense of fun.    That's probably true.    You should find a pretty girl.    I found you.  Charming like your father.  Just don't get me fired.  Then who would I bring doughnuts to?   Angel, \u00bfuna m\u00e1s?   Gracias.  De nada.  Just like me Empty inside.    Where the hell you been?   Crime scene.  What about these? The hotel cokehead murders, this dealer and the girl? Well, this hallmark looking couple didn't die by the hands of a professional.  No, this is child's play.  Messy work   All that blood on the walls looks like a finger painting.  You give me the fucking creeps, you know that, Dexter? Yeah, I know.  Sorry about that.    Fuck you.    Okay.  Is there something I can do? You can give me a fucking analysis on the blood spatter on this killings.  You think I'm here to invite you to my nephew's bris? I didn't know you were Jewish.  Shut the fuck up and write your report already.  Don't even know why I need you.  Grab a crayon, psycho, and scribble this down.  Rival dealer came in.  Two scumbags slashed to hell, dealer stole the drugs.  Wham, bam, done.  And I don't give a shit what you say because that's what happened and that's who I'm looking for.  Hey, we are looking for a motherfucking thief dealer.    You got it?   Okay.  Sure.  I guess.  But I should get over there.  Then get over there already, you fucking weirdo.    I need it quick.    I'm on it, sergeant.  The only real question I have is why, in a building full of cops, all supposedly with a keen insight into the human soul, is Doakes the only one who gets the creeps from me?   So this killer used a sword?   No.  Probably a very sharp knife.  Look at the blood spatter.  Look at the patterns.  It tells a story.  You see this big pond of blood right there? That's from the initial stab.  The male victim was standing right here, and the killer plunged his knife into the shoulder, severing the carotid artery, and   blpph   Notice the long, thick, heavy drips?   Yeah, nice.  Now, over here, you have nice, clean sprays of blood, that can only happen when you're holding something light and moving quick   nice, sharp slices through the body.  No splashes, no drips.  Clean and easy.  This guy knew how to use a blade.  So we're looking for a sushi chef.  Yeah, sushi chef is possible.  Wouldn't be my first choice, but, hey, you never know.    Now what?   Now I eat! The problem with eating and driving, which I love to do, is not being able to employ the 10:00 2:00 hand position on the wheel.  It's a matter of public safety.  But there's always a sacrifice.  This guy, Jamie Jaworski.  Six months ago, I think he fell in love with a pretty brunette, Mrs.  Jane Saunders   A sweet mother of two married to a successful banker   All living a pleasant life until she, unfortunately, disappeared, leaving the kids emotionally devastated forever.  The cops arrested my favorite valet, but his lawyer got him off on a faulty search warrant.  It's a good thing I don't bother with them.  Animals don't like me, especially dogs.  I don't think they approve of what I sometimes do to their masters.  That dog recognizes me as easily as I can recognize Jaworski or any other killer.  Interesting taste in literature.  His needs are evolving, turning violent.  He's on the fast track.  Have you ever wanted to kill anything else? You know, something bigger than a dog?   Yes.    Like a person? Yeah, but no one in particular.  Why didn't you? I thought you and mom wouldn't like it.  Come here.  Friday night.  Date night in Miami.  Every night is a date night in Miami, and everyone's having sex.  But for me, sex never enters into it.  I don't understand sex.  Not that I have anything against women, and I certainly have an appropriate sensibility about men, but when it comes to the actual act of sex, it's always just seemed so undignified.  But I have to play the game.  And after years of trying to look normal, I think I met the right woman for me.  Deb saved her life on a domestic dispute call, introduced us, and we've been dating for six months now.  She's perfect because Rita is, in her own way, as damaged as me.  I'm running late.  I'll just be a sec.    I have to change.    Okeydoke.  Hi, Dexter.  May I say that you look lovely this evening? Okay.  Master Cody, handsome as ever.  High five.  Do the space shuttle.  Vanilla Chocolate, and strawberry.    No coffee?   Which one do you think melts faster? Ready? Rita's ex hubby, the crack addict, repeatedly raped her, knocked her around.  Ever since then, she's been completely uninterested in sex.  That works for me.  Will you be back?   Of course I'll be back.    I meant Dexter.    You'll be asleep.    No, I won't.  Then I'll stop in and we'll all play cards.  Texas Hold 'em? Give mommy a kiss.    Ready?   Yeah.  Needless to say, I have some unusual habits, yet all these socially acceptable people can't wait to pick up hammers and publicly smash their food to bits.  Normal people are so hostile But not her.  Where are we going? They might need me.  Just stay right there.  I'll be right back.    Son of a whore.    Who? Talking about this hijo de puta, this asshole killer, this maric\u00f3n savage who makes us work on a Friday night.  Only Mondays through Thursdays   that's what I always say.  Of course, co\u00f1o, be reasonable.  Who wants to work on a Friday night? I have my needs.  So, \u00bfc\u00f3mo est\u00e1s? What are you doing here? I was in the neighborhood.  I'm on a date.    A date? Nice.    Same guy, same pattern.  Bone dry.  No blood again.  Pero mira esto.  There's some small differences in the cuts this time.  Over here   rough, almost emotion.  Then over here, not so much.    And then over here   clean.    Muy bien.  Yeah, nice.  But look at this.  All bone.  The killer flayed the skin, the flesh, completely off.    Now, why would he do that?   He's experimenting.  He's trying to find the right way.  Is he experimenting with the head, too? What do you mean? La bestia left her tits and took her fucking head.  I don't find anyone around here.  And God only knows what he's doing with it.  He's certainly raising the bar.  Damn! This guy is good.    Will they catch him soon?   I doubt it.  The killer is an artist.  What do you mean? His technique is incredible.  I'm sorry.  I don't think I want to.  I mean, I'm   I'm not ready.  Damn it, Dexter.  What have I done now? And why can't I get that neat stack of body parts out of my head? No blood.  Why did I touch her that way? I need to get back to my work.  Jaworski's website, \"scream bitch scream\"   the mother of all rape sites.  That's it.  He's definitely the one.  Now it's just a matter of time before he becomes a drop of blood in my glass slide collection.  But I have to wait.  I have to be careful and follow the code of Harry.  Hey, dad.    I can explain.    You and I had an understanding.  Whenever you get an urge, you come to me, you tell me, and we deal with it together.    I do tell you, dad.    The hell you do!   There's blood on this knife.    Animals.  I find animals, that's all.  Are you sure? Are you telling me the truth? Yes! I thought we had this under control.  You still don't remember anything from before,   you know, before we took you in?   No.  Is that why I have these urges? What happened changed something inside you.  It got into you too early.  I'm afraid your urge to kill is only gonna get stronger.  You're saying I'll be like this forever.  You're a good kid, Dex.  You are.  Otherwise, it would have been a lot worse than animals.  Okay? We can't stop this.  But maybe We can do something to channel it.    Use it for good.    How could it ever be good? Son, there are people out there who do really bad things.  Terrible people.  And the police can't catch them all.  Do you understand what I'm saying? You're saying they deserve it.  That's right.  But, of course, you have to learn how to spot them, how to cover your tracks.  But I can teach you.    Dad   It's okay, Dex.  You can't help what happened to you, but you can make the best of it.  Remember this forever   you are my son, you are not alone, and you are loved.  Okay.  Preparation is vital.  No detail can be overlooked.  And the ritual is intoxicating.  Duct tape Rubber sheets Necessary tools of the trade.  You can't bullshit me, Dex.  Help me out.  Laguerta has me interviewing hookers.  It's a waste of time.  Deb, if he was interrupted Think.  Jesus Christ, right.  Because then how do you have time to wrap all the pieces? She's dumber than the boat people.  Throw her a fucking raft.  But now we have a fourth body, and the cuts were different.  And that's telling us a story.  The ritual is changing.  He's looking for some kind of inspiration and not finding it.  So he keeps doing it until he gets it right.  I could be wrong.  So how the hell was your date with Rita last night? Great.  You should try it sometime.  You need a life.  Well, find me a guy I can trust.  I need a transfer to Homicide, bro, then we'll see about a life.  I understand that.  It certainly would sound better for the kids to say, \"mommy's on Homicide.  \"   Don't make me hit you.    Come on.  Then we could talk about more little Morgans, nephews and nieces.    What's wrong with that?   You sound like mom.  I just   tell me what you know about cell crystallization.    What do you mean?   I heard the coroner say it last night.  He was talking about that dead headless chick.    You got that look in your eye.    I was there before you, and I noticed this body looked different than the other ones.  The pieces were cold.  But meat packing cold.  Is that what cell crystallization means? My god, why didn't I think of that? It's beautiful.  Dex.  What are you thinking? Sorry.  That makes sense.  Cold.  It slows the flow of blood.  Why the hell is that important?   It's just a feeling.    That's not good enough.  I got to show Laguerta and her boys.  They're making fun of me.  They're saying the only way I can close a case is on my back.  I got to get out of Vice.  Dex, please, you got to   Refrigerated truck.  What the fuck are you talking about? A refrigerated truck.  He wants a cold environment to slow the flow of blood, clean and mobile so he can dump the garbage afterwards.  So I'm looking for a refrigerated truck now? Probably a stolen one.  You think there are a lot of stolen trucks out there? Are you nuts? In Miami? Choir kids Just do something.  Just find my husband.  Ma'am, the detectives are looking into everything.  I'm pretty sure I covered all my tracks.    What do you care about that woman?   I don't.  I was just   You like when women cry? You like that? What's your thing, psycho? I was just heading to the briefing room.  You got no call to be in there, so flee.  Lieutenant, this fucking guy doesn't belong.  I'm still waiting for his spatter report on the cokehead murders   Go do that.  It's okay.  I don't want to upset anybody.  He can stay.  I'd like your input, and we'll discuss your case after the meeting.  How about we get started?   \u00bfEncontr\u00e1ste algo?   Nada todav\u00eda.    Hazme un favor y qu\u00edtate la gorra.    Disc\u00falpame.    You ready?   I'm gonna shame this bitch.  Just state your case clean and easy.  You'll be the hero.  Okay, settle down.  Now, has anyone tracked down that witness? Come on, people.  Someone needs to find something here.    Lieutenant Laguerta?   Officer Morgan.  I didn't recognize you with your clothes on.  I have an idea, something in a different direction.  An idea? Well, please, share it with us.    Cell crystallization.    Excuse me? A little more confidence, please.  On the last victim, I'd like to check and see if any refrigerated trucks have been stolen in the last week or so.  Refrigerated trucks like ice cream trucks? No, not ice cream trucks.  A refrigerated vehicle that could cause that kind of tissue damage, a refrigerated truck that's mobile so he'll be harder to catch, a refrigerated truck that might give us a lead.  That's very interesting, very creative.  Let's keep looking for the witness, okay? We know that he or she is out there.  The forensic evidence, the interrupted cut proves that there was an eyewitness.  Now, somebody out there saw something, so let's concentrate on finding that person, okay? But   Just keep talking to all your hookers.  That's all for today.  What the fuck was I supposed to say? The only reason I'm in here is because the captain said they had to let me in.  But he didn't say they had to listen to you.  Well, right again.  So say adi\u00f3s to my career.  I'm gonna die a meter maid.  Stop it.  Deb, there's another way.  Find the truck.  Excuse me, Dexter My office, please.  What the hell? What the fuck? Are you boning her?   No.    Oh, my god!   Deb, wait.    Shut up.  It had nothing to do with drugs.  L. T. , this is a waste of our damn time.  I think sergeant Doakes is right.  I read the other reports, all the other forensic analysis.  Everyone agrees the cokehead murders had nothing to do with cocaine.  It was a crime of passion.  The murderer came to kill the woman, not the dealer.  He did him quick and got him out of the way.  But he sure as hell took his sweet time slicing up that lady, and you don't do that unless you have a close, personal relationship with someone.  Probably an ex boyfriend.  That's who I'd look for.  Okay.  It's a bit of a push, but, sergeant, you should check it out.  I'm watching you, motherfucker.  Jaworski's been coming here for weeks   likes to steal all the copper plumbing.  There's good money in that.  No security guards   that's good.    Fuck!   Talk.    What do you mean?   I think you know what I mean.  No.  Oh, god.  Talk to me about Jane Saunders.  Okay.  I did her.    How?   In a movie   snuff film.    But I'm not sorry.    Of course not.  No, I'm not sorry, either.    Hello?   Hey.  I'm   I'm sorry.  I mean, I'm sorry about the other night, but look, Dex, I really, really need to see you.  So can you   can you come by later, you know, just for, like, a little while? I mean, I'm really   All right.  What are you doing now? I'm just finishing up a little project, but I'll come by later.  Okay, bye.  All in all, it was a good night.  One less amateur filmmaker polluting the internet.  No way! Give us a minute.  Hanging in there? This will teach me to tailgate.  Let's go over this again.    I'm all yours.    So all the ice trucks in Miami     bit of a coincidence, don't you think?   Sure, during business hours.  But this time of night, a truck like that sticks out.  And you followed it.  That's right.    You never saw the driver?   Just high beams and a flying head.  So then he must have already had the head with him in the front seat.  That's weird.  Why would he keep it there? I don't know, so he could use a carpool lane? It just seems odd.  Your sister has this ice truck theory, and then here you are to back it up.  She's good, lieutenant.  You should give her a chance.  You know, you should call me Maria.  But I'll tell you who's good   you are.  Doakes picked up the killer in the cokehead murders.  You were right.  It was her boyfriend.  Of course, Doakes still hates you.  Of course.  Tell me, Dexter, how did you get to be so smart? Lots of sleep.  Is it okay if I fill out that report tomorrow? Sure thing.  You're tired.    Good night, lieutenant.    I'll catch you later.  Dex.  It's been a while.    I'm sorry.    I was worried.  I didn't know what to do.  I called in sick.  I mean   Are you okay?   Yeah, I'm fine.  I was just   I'm sorry.  There was another You know.  Look The kids slept over next door.  Okay.    Would you like to come in?   Okay.  Okay.  I don't want to lose you, Dex.  Okay, sure.  And well I want you.  I mean Okay.  Thanks.  You're welcome.    Do you mind?   No.    It could be the kids.    Better get it, then.  Hello? Cody.  Cody, stop crying, sweetie.  All right.  I'll come get you.  Cody just threw up all over Colleen's couch.  I got to go get him.    Tell me we're okay.    Better than.    Okay.    Go be a good mom.  Okay, that was close.  I'll admit, making out with Rita was Interesting.  But if I don't keep a lid on this, it could be the end of us.  I suppose I should be upset, even feel violated, but I'm not.  No.  In fact, I think this is a friendly message, kind of like, \"hey, want to play?\" And, yes, I want to play.  I really, really do.      Next Episode"

You better be a cop.  No Forensics.  There is no blood near the body at all.  It's the weirdest thing you ever saw.  I've never seen such clean, dry, neat Looking dead flesh.  How is he doing? How does the killer get rid of the blood? One of these days, you're gonna tell me.  I told you blood spatter doesn't take up all my time.  How the hell was your date with Rita last night? Great.  She's perfect because Rita is, in her own way, as damaged as me.  Open your eyes and look at what you did! Please, you have to understand.  Trust me.  I definitely understand.  Hello? What are you doing now? I'm just finishing up a little project, but I'll come by later.    They found another hooker.    Une autre? That's the third one in five months.  Third? You mean there's a Serial killer, that's right.  Dex, there are people out there who do really bad things.  Of course, you have to learn how to spot them, but I can teach you.  The killer flayed the skin, the flesh, completely off.  Why would he do that? He's experimenting, Trying to find the right way.  He's certainly raising the bar.  Damn! This guy is good.  The killer is an artist.  You give me the fucking creeps.  You know that, Dexter? Yeah, I know.  Sorry about that.  But now we have a fourth body, and the cuts were different.  And that's tellings a story.  The ritual is changing.  I'd like to check and see if any refrigerated trucks have been stolen in the last week or so.  It just seems odd.  Your sister has this ice truck theory, and then here you are to back it up.  She's good, lieutenant.  You should give her a chance.  I think this is a friendly message.  \"Hey, want to play?\" And, yes, I want to play.  I really, really do.  I dream.  I dream I'm floating on the surface of my own life, watching it unfold, observing it.  I'm the outsider, looking in.  Yeah! Man! You want to play, man?! Come on! In the water! Look at them.  They can laugh and play.  It comes so easily for them.  Even though I'm not one of them, even though sometimes I can really be a monster today, I'm just a sea monster.  Soon enough, I'll have to go back to doing what I do So I make a point of enjoying days like this when I have them.  Just a second.  The ice truck killer left me a gruesome souvenir.  Explaining it could be kind of  awkward.  Hey.  Bagels, brother.  Let me in.  Could it be more depressing in here? Got anything to drink? It's hot as hell out there.  O. J. ? With ice.  So, how you doing? I'm fine.  Yeah, things are fine.  Breakfast, which I already had, was fine, but you know me I'm always hungry.  So, what's up, hotshot? All right, get this Lieutenant's looking for that refrigerated truck in every swamp, glade, and chop shop from here to the Keys.  But the way I see it, that whackjob truck driver threw a severed head at your car.  It's not as if he's shy.  You think he's hiding the truck in plain sight, wanting it to be found? I could answer that if Laguerta didn't have me back with my hookers, looking for a witness Finding that truck is your golden ticket into Homicide.  Tell me about it.  Just because Laguerta has you looking for hookers on her time doesn't mean you can't look for the truck On my time! What's with these? I've got court.  Why is it we never talk brother sister stuff? Our dad was a cop.  You're a cop.  I work for the cops.  For us, this is brother sister stuff.  Brings out your eyes.  First he throws a severed head at me, then he leaves me these doll parts, like pieces of a puzzle.  I like puzzles.  But there's nothing more frustrating than putting a puzzle together and finding then it still doesn't make sense.  Please state your name and occupation.  My name is Dexter Morgan, and I'm a forensics specialist in blood spatter analysis for the Miami metro police department.  And how long have you been doing blood spatter analysis? Almost twelve years.  You've been involved in quite a few cases, then.  Give or take.  No, 2,103.  Then it's safe to say blood is your life.  Safe to say.  Unlike the other guys down at the station, I love coming to court to rub shoulders with the good people of the Sunshine State and Sasquatch.  In a courthouse, everyone's on their best behavior like they're being watched.  And they are.  Some people would look at this family and see only tragedy and heartbreak.  But I see so much more than that.  I'll do this, okay? I see opportunity.  Alexander Pryce finished his homework, kissed his mom, went out for a jog.  He told her he'd be back in time to take out the trash cans.  Just another night, until until the defendant not only struck him with his car but fled the scene, leaving Alexander Pryce alone and dying for hours before his body was found the next morning From heinous to unspeakable.  The people will prove that not only did Mr.  Chambers strike and kill Alexander Pryce but did so while once again under the influence of alcohol.  Happy birthday, Alex! Thank you.    Rip right into it.    What?   Yeah.    Hope it's money.  Yeah, you wish.  Surprise.  Thanks, guys.  It's like 80 degrees out.  But next year at this time, we're coming to visit you at Harvard.  It's everything I've ever wanted for you, Alexander.  Thanks, dad.  All right, enough corniness.  I see their pain.  On some level, I even understand their pain.  I just can't feel their pain.  It just a Matter of time before we see how far Matt Chambers's crocodile tears will get him.  But until then, a little of my favorite tropical fruit The perfect driving food next to a pulled pork sandwich.  Also, I can keep my energy up for the day job.  * ven conmigo * * junto a mi coraz\u00f3n * * y me quite la vida* *si no tengo tu amor * Detective!   Buena.    Buena? Did we get an I. D. ? First on scene pulled the wallet.  We're still waiting.  Hello, Dex.  Her boss   Lieutenant Laguerta.  In keeping with her total sense of entitlement, she has this attraction to me.  And I thought I was creepy.  Given the skin rupture and the secondary spatter, distance had to be a 50 , 60 foot drop.  The eastbound's only 40 feet.  It's not high enough for this kind of damage so best guess, originating point is the westbound causeway.  Get me a team on the westbound causeway! She's good.  Angel, look at this.  I think there's something in his mouth.  Medic! It's just a death rattle.  He's gonzo.  You better check out my friend, too.  No telling what this guy might have had.  This is what he had.  Call me crazy, Angel, but I think this is human flesh.  Hooked up with Sean last night.  The cable guy Sean? God, no.  He smelled like cheese.  So the mechanic Sean? Yep.  He came over.  We opened a bottle of Pinot gris.  We finished a bottle of Pinot gris.  Before I knew it, we were Stop that.  You don't want to hear this, do you? No.  But if you two are getting serious, I'd love to meet him.  Why don't you and Sean the mechanic join me and Rita the girlfriend for dinner tomorrow night? Why? So you can tell me later he's not good enough for your little sister? Don't.  You're the one who was going on about brother and sister stuff this morning.  And that becomes brother and sister double dating? Because I'm on head of yours.  Come on.  It'll be fun.  All right, we'll go, but I'm not promising we'll have any fun.  Not now.  What crawled up his ass? He hates lab rats.  Well, here's a headline It's lab rats that make us cops look good.  Okay, listen up.  We just got an I. D.  on the body from under the causeway.  His name is Ricky Simmons.  He was a cop.    Let me ask you something.    Yeah.  When we were partners, you used to use every excuse in the book to get out of making a next of kin notification.  I knew Ricky from the department softball team.  He was a good guy, a good cop.  It's the least I could do.  Motherfucker! Call it in! We need E. M. T.  and police backup now.  I'll check the house.  Kara, it's me.  It's James.  You're okay.  It's me.  It's okay.  This is so fucked up, man.  Going after a cop's family Who would do such a thing? That's why we're here.  But it's still fucked up.  They're telling me Ricky Simmons was under deep cover in Carlos Guerrero's family.  All right.  Thanks.  He'd been working the gig for 10 months, and everything was good.  But this Going after his wife Guerrero's crossing a whole new line.  Now he's gone and pissed off the entire Miami police department.  Is there any word on the wife? She should be in surgery by now.  \u00bfQu\u00e9 pas\u00f3? There's an inconsistency somewhere.  And that would be? I'm not sure, but it's the answer to a question we haven't thought of yet.  Look.    Whose is it?   Probably hers.  Ricky Simmons, her husband   Last number dialed.  I got it.  Good work, Angel.  Well, actually, it was Dexter.  Sergeant? Ladies and gentlemen, we have a new world record! Stop it! Can't stop! Must tickle! Got to hear the magic word! I have your magic word right here.  Chocolate chip.  Cookies! Homemade.  Okay, you guys, take your cookies into the bedroom.  Two each.  But you never let us eat in our bedroom.  Well, I want some alone time with Dexter.  Are you gonna kiss him? Actually, yes.  Cool.  Gross! Cookie? I wuv cookies.  Well, you're snarfing them down like the cookie monster.  No, this isn't snarfing.  This is eating with enthusiasm.  Tell me about your day.  I had court You know, the blood thing.  And then a crime scene and more blood.  I don't know how you do it.  Well, blood is my life.  my job.  Lately, the thing that surprises me most about Rita is how much I like being with her.  But whenever that happens with a woman, when I feel comfortable with her, it all goes wrong.  That's why I think it's best to take it one step at a time.  Hey, you know, Deb has been all over me for us to get together with her new boyfriend.  You think you can get a babysitter some night? You mean an actual grown up meal? I'd love that.  Make a date.  I pick you.  And I pick my sister to chaperon.  Sister.  So, Miami's the haystack, and the ice truck's the needle, right? O kay.  And, brother, I just found the fucking needle! How'd you find it? I put the word out with patrol You know, the whole hide in plain sight thing.  Juan Pierre flagged this one and called me.  This is a busy street.  Anyone see the driver? The restaurant manager said it was here when he opened up.  Is this the one you saw? I feel like a kid at his own surprise party.  This is the same truck.  It's hard to say.  It all happened so fast.  Let's go on a nonforensic geek limb here and say that it is.  Why is it still running? It keeps the back compartment refrigerated.  Dios m\u00edo.  Holy shit, they're fucking fingertips.  Clean slices, no blood.  My guess is he drained the body entirely before these cuts were made.  How'd he do that? Some kind of pump? No.  I had forensics do a workup on our last victim.  Our guy's old school.  Yeah, he hoists the body up, severs the jugular.  The heart does all the work.  It's the most effective method, really.  Fucking butcher.  There are 206 bones in the human body.  He could have left any one of them.  But he gave us exactly what we need to identify the victim, like he's leaving a trail of bread crumbs.  Who made the find? Officer Morgan.  Harry's daughter? Must be in the genes, her and her brother.  This truck's a good get.  It's their first solid lead.  I encourage all my officers to think outside the box.  Well, nice work, lieutenant.  I got the Deputy Mayor.  Congratulate Morgan for me.  Another beautiful Miami day   Mutilated corpses with the chance of afternoon shows.  Chalk one up for Miami metro, eh, ma'am? Last time I checked, Morgan, I'm the lieutenant, which means my officers keep me apprised at all times on all things.  You pull a stunt like that again, it won't matter who your father was.  Okay? Dude, is this blood? It's chocolate.  It's on your shirt, too.  It's a new shirt.  What is taking so long? It's a big truck.  They won't find anything, not even a Tic Tac.  He's thought all this through.  I know I would.  Your famous hunches telling you anything? Ice cold.  You're a goddamn riot.  This fucking guy's toying with us.  Deb's right.  This truck's not another piece of the puzzle They are.  Watching ice melt This is fun.  Stand a little closer, Morgan, and I'll melt your heart.  I think he's got a crush on you, Dex.  Yo, I was talking to Morgan the sister.  Vince Masuka only swings one way.  Yeah, from vine to vine.  Enough.  I'm glad to see the sexual harassment seminar really paid off.  This is seriously fucked up, my friends.  Why go to all this trouble? What's this sick son of a bitch trying to tell us? Not \"us\".  Me.  My freezer, the painted doll's fingernails I think he's trying to impress me And it's working.  What, a man can't call his wife three times in one day? S\u00ed, claro.  Bueno.  Kiss my baby and tell her, \"daddy be home para la cena.  \" I'm getting another call.  Yeah, te amo.  Batista.  \u00bfDe veras? I'll be there in two minutes.  She's still in surgery.  The doctors are hopeful.  Ice truck killer returns, dead undercover cop   It's a typical day in the neighborhood.  You got to hear this.  Ricky, where the fuck are you? I'm gonna try for the back door.  Fuck, he saw me! Please don't hurt me! Lieutenant! National database kicked back the DNA match.  Norberto Cervantes.  Let me see that.  Dame.  Ahora.  Es tu d\u00eda de mala suerte.  Estoy agradecido por tu lealdad.  El gusto es m\u00edo, patr\u00f3n.  Police! Put your hands up! Get them down! Put your fucking hands up! Put your hands up! Is that necessary? It's a dangerous world, Guerrero.  Yes, and one can't be too careful, detective.  Yes, I I've had alc problems with alcohol in the past.  I never tried to hide that.  But you heard from my A. A.  sponsor.  I  I've been sober for over a year now.  Look, I I'm not disputing that that it was my car that hit Mr.  Pryce.  But I reported it stolen hours before the accident.  Men like Matt Chambers know how to pull on the invisible mask of sympathy, even empathy, and otherwise right thinking people don't stand a chance.  \"Not guilty.  \" Matt Chambers may have found a way to beat the system but so have I.  Ricky, where the fuck are you? Fuck, he saw me.  Please don't hurt me! The way we see it, you're in on the kill of Ricky Simmons, but that's not enough for you or for Guerrero.  Ricky is dead? That saddens me.  Shut the fuck up! Wait, you're not implying that Ricky Simmons was a cop, are you? I'm truly disappointed.  Not only do I have a dead cop, someone broke in his house and shot his wife.  Word out in the world, sergeant Simmons's wife was fucking around.  Maybe he tried to kill the bitch himself, and felt so bad about it, he committed suicide.  A cop murder suicide It's a health crisis for you guys, ain't it? You think it's a fucking coincidence your ass is in here?! We got you on the causeway the morning Ricky Simmons died! Bullshit.  We don't deal in bullshit.  We deal in good police work And good science.  You must have been a motherfucker at cat's cradle.  I never played it.  Okay, Kara Simmons was shot while she was running.  Her phone call tells us that, right? And she was running towards the back door There.  She turns.  The shooter sees her.  She's shot high on the chest.  It spins her around, spraying blood on the walls there and there.  She loses her cellphone.  She struggles with the coffee table, the couch, and then she finally falls back, \"Pop\" There.  She never got this far.  It's not her blood.  Angel, meet our shooter.  DNA of Cervantes' flesh in Ricky Simmons' mouth.  DNA from a rogue drop of blood we found at the Simmons' house.  Tell me you're sure about this.  That puts Cervantes at both crime scenes.  Let's nail his coffin and ship it.  Hang on, sergeant.  We get him to roll over on Guerrero and we own them both.  You're talking about throwing him a deal? And then, what? He walks? If he does, we pick him up on other charges.  If he gets us Guerrero, it's win win.  Gets us Guerrero?! We can't catch the guy.  He's un fucking touchable! Come on, lieutenant.  We already got a win.  It's not about your win.  It's about the big picture.  I've seen this before.  Whenever a cop is killed, it's like everyone's life has been stopped in mid sentence.  Davey Sanchez was a fearless and dedicated cop.  Davey Sanchez was a son, a husband, and a father.  Davey Sanchez was my partner.  Davey Sanchez was my hero.  That was great.  What, dad? Ever since Davey was killed, my world feels out of control.  How do you fix it? Two ways, I guess Honor Davey's memory and catch the bastard who did this to him.  It's not about vengeance.  It's not about retaliation or balancing the books.  It's about something deep inside.  My father had more than his share of pain.  But he didn't deal with it the way most people do.  Happy hour Now, there's a misnomer.  I'll have what he's having.  Wise choice.  You celebrating? Something like that.  Hey, have we met? I doubt it.  I just moved down here.  I needed a new start.  Girlfriend or boyfriend? Ex wife.  She said I drank too much.  Hence the \"ex\" part.  Fuck her.  Man, she was all over me to change, like she never done anything wrong in her life Besides marrying me.  We all make mistakes.  Unfortunately, mine usually involve lawyers.  God! Damn it! I thought I was the only one who hated the Hurricanes.  I take it you didn't grow up in Miami.  No, I've had to move around some.  Say no more.  But home is where my ass is.  I'm getting mine out of town.  Enjoy Miami.  Remember, there's nothing a new city can't cure.  You got that right.  Thanks, buddy.  Next one's on me.  You sure you're good to drive? Been a lot worse.  I sure hope he doesn't go out there and kill himself.  That would be tragic.  Matt Chambers is accused of committing a crime in Florida.  He was arrested in Florida, and he's being tried in Florida.  So the good people of Florida only went as far as validating their own assumptions that Matt Chambers is a Florida bad guy.  \"Nothing a new city can't cure.  \" My father taught me one thing above all others To be sure.  And I am.  Matt Chambers, Miami is your last stop.  If God is in the details, and if I believed in God, then he's in this room with me.  I just wish he'd brought an extension cord.  It's James.  We're gonna get the bastard who did this to you.  This guy is just toying with us, and Laguerta's too fucking dumb to see it.  Yeah, Deb was saying that this psycho guy cut off that chick's fingertips? Man, that's got to suck, right? Guerrero taking home lobsters to boil alive   That's not his style.  He usually leaves the killing to someone else.  So, how long have you two been going out? A couple weeks, I guess.  Deb never mentioned how you met.  Well, she brought her car into my shop, and You have your own place? No, but I wish I did.  Some day, huh? Dex, enough with the Inquisition.  No, it's all right.  If I had a sister with legs like yours, I'd be checking out the dude she was seeing, too.  Is this guy a keeper or what? Come on.  I'll get you another drink.  Are you guys good? Yep.  Seems like a nice guy.  They could barely keep their hands off each other.  I can kill a man, dismember his body, and be home in time for \"Letterman.  \" But knowing what to say when my girlfriend's feeling insecure I'm totally lost.  Off your ass, Cervantes.  Hands behind your back.  Walk backwards and assume the position.  Step away.  Exit the cell.  Where are we going? The call came down.  They want you moved to a more secure block.  You think the call to take care of me came down from the warden? Who the fuck do you think the warden listens to? Get used to it.  That's from Mr.  Guerrero.  * Are you sleeping?* * Brother John* * Morning bells are ringing* * Ding ding dong* * Ding ding dong* Every time a woman tries to do this to me, it tickles.  Still, it's not entirely unpleasant.  What? The kids.  They sleep through thunderstorms.  I'm sorry.  Tell me wh? I  I can't do this.  It's okay.  That's okay.  I'm okay.  We have an elephant in the room, and its name is \"Sex.  \" Tell me about it.  As far as I'm concerned, it can just stay in the corner and mind its own damn business.  It's easier said than done.  Yeah.  But it needs to be right For both of us.  Or it won't be right for either of us.  I don't want that.  Do you? No.  You know I can't believe I found the one good, truly decent man left on the planet.  was found dead in a basement hallway of the Miami metro jail.  Norberto Cervantes was a known associate of reputed drug lord Carlos Guerrero.  Speculation is that another inmate is responsible for the mayhem here tonight.  Notice how the skin is gloving around the joints? And that is important because? A sure sign of postmortem severance, meaning the victim was already dead when she was relieved of her fingertips.  Why the different nail polishes? What the hell is this guy thinking? He's thinking, \"Tag, Dexter, you're it.  \" I don't know.  Do you have an I. D. ? Shari Taylor.  Another hooker.    At least he's consistent.    Yeah.  Killing young women who have to sell their bodies just to survive or feed their kids.  My sister puts up a front so the world won't see how vulnerable she is.  Me, I put up a front so the world won't see how vulnerable I'm not.  I don't care who these fingertips belong to, only what my new friend out there is trying to say.  Morgan? The Captain wants you.  Her.  You wanted to see me, sir? Lieutenant Laguerta has something she wants to tell you.  Officer Morgan, you've shown tremendous initiative these last few days.  Because of you, we were able to track down that ice truck, and we now have an I. D.  on the latest victim.  The Captain believes you should be reassigned from Vice to Homicide.  And I concur.  Congratulations.  You're a good cop, like your old man.  Thank you, sir! Thank you so much.  You keep this up and I see a detective shield in your future.  I won't let you down, sir.  I hope you know what you're doing.  I promoted you, didn't I? Now find me this ice truck son of a bitch!   Okay?   Okay.  Y nina y tu hija, \u00bfc\u00f3mo est\u00e1n? Est\u00e1n maravillosas.  T\u00fa sabes que ellas tambi\u00e9n te necesitan, \u00bfeh? Angel, vete a tu casa.  Okay.  Burning the oil? I clocked out.  Why are you going at this so hard? When someone comes after one of us, he comes after all of us.  I know that look, Maria.  You got something to say, just say it.  I just got off the phone with the hospital.  Kara Simmons suffered massive heart failure 30 minutes ago.  I got to be there.  James, she died.  Was Cervantes right? Was Kara sleeping with someone other than Ricky? Was it you? What the fuck were you thinking?! What the fuck business is it of yours?! My cops, my precinct, my business! Kara was gonna ask Ricky for a divorce as soon as he came off undercover.  She didn't want to She didn't want to hurt him when he was on the case.  If I go by the book, I take you off the case.  Fuck the book.  There's nobody in this building more motivated to get Revenge? Justice.  Take point on Guerrero.  Thanks.  In slaughterhouses, they stun the animals before butchering them.  It's the humane thing to do.  Those animals, they're the lucky ones.  \"Brother, meet me at Loco's Crab Shack.  \"Totally important.  Do not let me down.  Deb.  \" Gone to rest his weary head.  The good news is, he'll still be here when I come back for our own personal happy hour.  God, these are so good.  Not as good as your good news.  My little sister's all growed up and transferred to Homicide.  And the best part Laguerta had to say the actual words.  I thought her head would explode.  I'm really proud of you.  You had my back the whole way, and I appreciate it.  I mean that.  You're the best.  And that's why I wanted to share this moment with you.  So, Sean was busy? It turns out there's another woman.  Who? Me.  Sean the mechanic is married? Imagine me picking the wrong guy, huh? And you and he are So over.  I dumped his married ass.  I just wish I could get into a healthy relationship, like you and Rita, without the drama and the tension and the uncertainty.  Yeah, I'm a lucky guy.  Jesus, dad, it's called being on time! Did you ever hear of it? I was having a bad day.  The Captain and I had a discussion.  Well, maybe you sh Wait.  W  What kind of bad day? It's about the guy who killed Davey, isn't it? The judge said the bust wasn't righteous and let him walk.  That guy kills a cop, and nothing happens? That's not fair.  Life's not fair, Dexter.  Can't anyone do anything? Can't you do something? No, not now.  So what, then? The world just keeps spinning out of control? No.  The world can always be set right again.  That guy kills a cop, and nothing happens? Not anymore.  Be back in a sec.  I'm kind of running the gamut here emotion wise.  Nature calls.  All the planning, the making sure Does it go away because I have a chance to rid the world of a cop killer and balance the books? Do I just ignore everything my father taught me about how to do this right, about how to stay safe so I can do it again? Yep.  I don't give a shit about your goddamn problems.  I gave you a job.  You take care of it.  What the fuck you looking at? Happy birthday, Alex! Rip right into it.  But next year at this time It's you.  And you.  Thanks, dad.  All right, enough corniness.  We meet again for the last time.  I didn't do anyth  Anything.  Some people believe that.  The problem is, I don't.  But it's true.  I was   I was set up.  By whom? That   That family.  They needed someone to blame.  It's a natural thing to do when you're grieving.  So then none of this is your fault? I swear.  Okay! Okay! Okay! No! Okay.  Okay.  Stop.  All right.  Okay, okay.  It   It was me, only it wasn't me.  It was the booze.  It takes me over.  That's a point of view to which I'm not entirely unsympathetic.  Neither you nor I is in complete control of our destinies.  Although, at the moment, it would seem I have the upper hand.  Really, I'm so sorry.  You've done this too many times to be sorry.  Carlos Guerrero has chosen to live in a dangerous world.  That's his truth.  My truth is, that world doesn't need me to balance its books.  Matt Chambers, welcome to your last change of address.  You'll like it here.  You and your neighbors have so much in common.  The worst thing about finally putting together a puzzle is finding there are missing pieces.  He came back and left nothing behind but a message   Come find me.  And I will.  There are no secrets in life, just hidden truths that lie beneath the surface.      Previous EpisodeNext Episode"

        "script": "Previously on \"Dexter\" What happened changed something inside you, Dex.  It got into you too early.  I'm afraid your urge to kill is only gonna get stronger.  I want to catch this guy before he kills another one of my girls.  What can I do to help? No blood.  What a beautiful idea.  Refrigerated truck.  He wants a cold environment to slow the flow of blood.  I suppose I should be upset, even feel violated, but I'm not.  In fact, I think this is a friendly message, kind of like, \"hey, want to play?\" Finding that truck is your golden ticket into Homicide.  So Miami's the haystack, and the ice truck's the needle.  I just found the fucking needle.  Oh, this is seriously fucked up, my friends.  I think he's trying to impress me and it's working.  The Captain believes you should be reassigned from Vice to Homicide.  Thank you, sir.  Rita is, in her own way, as damaged as me.    Are you gonna kiss him?   Actually, yes.  We just got an I. D.  on the body from under the causeway.  His name is Ricky Simmons.  He was a cop.  They told me Ricky Simmons was under deep cover in Carlos Guerrero's family.  Guerrero's crossing a whole new line.  Now he's gone and pissed off the entire Miami police department.  It's me.  It's James, okay? It's okay.  Was Kara sleeping with someone other than Ricky? Was it you? James, she died.  Miami's full of good cops, a lot of them here today.  But no offense   I wouldn't want any of you hitting on my sister.  Ricky was different.  He was the kind of guy you hoped your sister would fall for.  Most people have a hard time dealing with death, but I'm not most people.  It's the grief that makes me uncomfortable.  Not because I'm a killer   Really.  I just don't understand all that emotion, which makes it tough to fake.  In those cases, shades come in handy.  Mac.    I'm sorry, man.    Thanks, man.  It's a fucking travesty.    You going after Guerrero?   Guerrero ordered these hits.  I'm gonna make something stick to that cartel cocksucker.  I didn't know you and Ricky were so tight.  Ain't about that.  Fuck with a cop, you lose the privilege to walk the streets.    I'm not right?   You're right.  tragic loss of our fellow officer.  But we praise his courage.  Ricky knew no fear.  People believe Laguerta? She didn't even know Simmons.  She knew he was a cop.  Wait.  Did you tell her? Proud of you for coming, bro.  I know you hate funerals.    How you holding up?   I'm managing.  No, I'm not.  Keeping one's face pinched in sorrow for two hours straight is a real chore.  A whole life reduced to ashes.  For Ricky Simmons, it's over.  But sometimes, you get a second chance.  Florida prisons kick free They don't do that for me, but it sure feels like it.  I search for the ones who think they've beat the system.  They're not hard to find, like Jeremy Downs.  Jeremy got off easy: four years in a juvenile facility for manslaughter.  To the coroner, the knife strokes looked random, impulsive, but I saw the work of a young virtuoso.  Too many major arteries were severed   Femoral, brachial, carotid.  Today Jeremy is just another piece of trash on the street, but four years ago, he was the toast of Miami.  It was a gruesome scene today   The bloody body of a teenage boy found stabbed to death inside this south Miami park.  Police haven't released the name of the victim yet, but our sources are telling us that investigators are holding a 15 year old suspect in custody.  We're hearing that the suspect lured the older boy to the pond to spot alligators, but once they were alone, the victim was robbed and repeatedly stabbed.  But I knew what he was and what he'd do again.  All I had to do was circle my calendar and wait.  Lemonade for my sweaty workers? What do you say, crew? Anybody parched? What's parched? When we put in the new lemon tree, we'll be able to make our own fresh squeezed lemonade.  Can we have a lemonade stand? I'll apply for a business license first thing in the morning.  Thank you for doing this, Dexter.  You know, I moved here from Michigan with dreams of fruit trees in my yard.  But they keep dying.  I can't help it.  I kill things.  That must be awful.  Fortunately, I have a green thumb.  The key to happy citrus is a fertilizer.  Bone meal works the best.  Hey, Rita.  Paul doesn't live here anymore.  No shit.  He's in jail.  But See, he still owes me for two ounces of blow, which means you owe me.  Don't get involved.  I never know in these situations.    I don't have money.    You got a car.    You want my car?   Yeah.  The keys in it? You know my dad? I sure do, little man.  And you want to know something? You look just like him.  I'm gonna tell him you said hi, okay? Look, if you want, I could go in the house, throw your furniture around, make a real mess, but what kind of message would that send to the little ones? Just give me the fucking car.  Why don't you go inside and get the keys? I'll wait with our friend here.  What? You think you can take me with your little red shovel?   Everything okay in there?   Yeah.    You need toilet paper?   No.  The guy clearly had no idea who he was dealing with.  I'll file a report at work.  We'll get your car back.  No No reports, Dexter.  Thank you, but Paul's out of my life.  I filed for divorce.  I just want my past to go away.  Well, it went away in your Rav 4.  Whatever it takes.  I can give you a ride to work until you get another car.  Or I could take the bus like millions of other people.  Come on, let's go outside and enjoy this beautiful day.  Come on, kids.  What did they use, an ax? It's blunt force.  See the way the head's caved in? You guys check out the new hottie McGotass in dispatch yet? She's a butter face.    What's a butter face?   You know, compadre   She's got a hot body, but her face How great would it be to pull a bronco on her? Yeah.  Yeah? Mira a qu\u00ed.  You do it doggy style, right? And just when she's getting into it, you grab her by the hips and you yell another woman's name, and bam   you're riding her like a bronco 'cause she's trying to buck you off.  Many times in life, I feel like I'm missing some essential piece of the human puzzle.  This is one of them.  What are you doing? Oh, the bronco.  See, socia? She knows.  I just got my first official Homicide call.  He's back.  Who's back? The ice truck killer? That's right.  You won't believe where he left the body.  I knew he'd be back.  Feels like Christmas morning.  Look at that   A miracle on ice.  Stunning.  You all right, Dexter? This is like a dream.  Standing on the home ice of the Miami Blades.  I never pegged you for a hockey fan.  There's something about standing in a big cool hole I find very relaxing.  So, what do we know? Same as the others.  No blood.  So far, I don't see any hesitation cuts.  No bones flayed.  I think our boy's got his confidence back.  He never lost it.  He was just getting bored.  What do you think he's trying to tell us? That hockey's a violent sport.    What else?   He's escalating the thrill.  Posing his victim in the middle of a to show them   to show us   what he's capable of doing.  What did I miss?   Relax.  You didn't miss anything.    Yeah, but she is   fingertips.  This body belongs to the frozen fingertips we found in the truck.  Sherry Taylor.  It's another prostitute.  No blood   no need for me.  Morgan, come up to the command center.  We may have a suspect.    Is there really a suspect?   I'll let you know, bro, when I get back from my first official Homicide investiga    I know her.    Sherry? Yeah, she called herself Cherry.  We worked the same corner when I was undercover.  You were, like, friends? Yes.    Do you want a hug?   Fuck off.  I tore apart the security office.  A surveillance tape is missing.  Let me guess   The one covering the ice.    They said you were good.    Don't bust my balls.  I've got the press knocking on the door outside.  Somebody who was here last night saw something   Rent a badge, cleaning crew, crack whore in the men's room? Come on, work with me.  They got a night watchman, but we can't find him.    Well, then, he's a suspect.    Unless the ice truck killer abducted him to gain entry into the arena.  Did your brother help you out with that logic? The night watchman could've just been at the wrong place at the wrong time.  We need to get to his apartment to see what we can find.  Actually, I was hoping I could hit Calle Ocho, talk to my old contacts.  I thought you wanted to get out of Vice.  Isn't that what you cried to the Captain last week? Yeah, I mean I didn't cry.  Listen, my girls know this victim, okay? They may have information that could help us.  No, I want you to work with Doakes.  Maria, she has contacts.    You still got your tube top?   And my nipple clamps.  Don't come back without any information.  Everyone moves to Miami to die, which means we have more junk than any city in America.  A skilled bargain hunter can find real treasure here, but that's not my idea of hunting.  I prefer a stalk and ambush approach.  My instincts are impeccable, but I have to be sure of my prey.  We're all adrenaline rush, you know? Kill it til it dies.  We all meat hunters, just out looking for dinner.  What you looking for?   Can I see that one?   Eh, good eye.  It's a fixed blade skinning knife.  Full tang, stainless steel.  Real time saver for the hunter who likes to do his own butchering in the field.  See the way that blade curves like that? It's like the talon of an eagle.  I'll take it.  Hell, yeah, you'll take it.  Why would you not? I'll get your change.  Easy, kid.  What the fuck are you doing, boy? I didn't see him.    You all right, mister?   Yeah, I'm fine.  Honest mistake.  No harm.  Hey.  You be careful with that thing, huh? Sorry about that, boss.  I only sell them.  So, what you hunt   trophies or meat? What do you think today, Dex? The Winchester?   What about the 9mm?   A handgun? Not exactly the weapon of choice for pheasants.  You need a wide spread to bring them down.  Did you ever shoot anybody, dad?   Afraid so.    Any of them die? Just one.  How'd it feel to kill a guy? Not so great, Dex.  When you take a man's life, you're not just killing them.  You're snuffing out all the things he'll ever become.  As a cop, I only fire my weapon to save a life.  That's a code I live by.  Killing must serve a purpose.  Otherwise, it's just plain murder.    You understand?   Yeah.  Changed my mind.  I think we'll take the Ruger.  Rifle? I thought that shotguns were best for pheasants.  We're not gonna hunt pheasants.    It's a big one.    Yeah.  This deer will put meat on our table tonight.  It's still alive.  For now, this hunt will control the urges you feel.  Channel them.  Why don't you go ahead, son? Really? Put the poor animal out of its misery.    Hi, Rose.    Hi.  Congratulations on your confirmation.  Thank you.  Do I know you? My name's James Doakes.  Miami metro P. D.  I'm investigating the murder of an undercover cop and his wife.  That's terrible.  Were they members of the church?   No, Rose, they weren't.    I don't understand.  Rose, have you ever seen this man before? I don't know.  Why are you asking me? Get away from my daughter.  It's okay.  At my church? In front of my family? Ricky and Kara had a family, too.  You just opened a dangerous door.  No, man, you did When you murdered a cop and an innocent lady.  What is he talking about, daddy? Come on, honey.  Let's go.    Daddy.    Let's go! You don't play by the rules, Guerrero.  Why should I? You've got five minutes, Bizach, okay? Yo, look who's back.  Pero mirela, como est\u00e1 caliente! Who'd you fuck   Dolce or Gabbana? I let them both pull a train, okay? Listen, I I got a confession to make.  I'm I'm not who you think I am.  I'm a cop.  Bridgett, get back   Bridgett! I'm not gonna bust   You're not a cop.  You're a whore.    I'm not a fucking whore.    Fucking who? What's wrong with being a fucking whore, huh? We trusted you, Brandy.  My name's Debra, okay? And I'm not here to bust you.  He hit again   The ice truck killer.  He got Cherry.  Cherry? Shit.  This shit's crazy.  I'm out.  I got a sister who lives in Ohio, runs a fashion boutique store.  I'm on the bus tomorrow.  I ain't closing my shop for no sick, psycho bitch.  Fucking woman hater.  I was on the street before him.  Fuck it.  I can get him, you guys.  You just got to give me something.  Did any of you all see Cherry with anyone the night before last? Well, I saw her last night, and then she got into a car and never came back.  But I was working all night, so You know the driver? No, but the car was, like, one of those old station wagons that have, like, wood panels on the side.  This is good.  This is good.  This is a lead.  I should go get Laguerta to listen.  Who's Laguerta? She's my lieutenant.  She hates me.  But I'm close with the Captain.  I'll talk to him.    What?   Never piss off your pimp.    Laguerta's not my pimp.    Is that right? Bitch tell you what to do? Is your pussy taking all the grief? Does she steal everything you earn? Yeah, she definitely does that.  Then she's your pimp, baby, and she will mess you up if you play her.  I told you   I'm not a fucking whore.  What's wrong with being a fucking whore? Hey.  Bought you a present to celebrate your first official homicide case.  Seriously? It's a cactus.  You only have to water it three times a year.  Gee, Dex, you didn't have to go out of your way.  I didn't.  I was at the swap meet.  So, any news on our frosty friend? One of my contacts said she saw Cherry getting in a wood panel station wagon the night she died.  Did you check the DMV database? As we speak.  There are thousands of registered station wagon owners in Miami Dade county, but guess who's not on the list? The night watchman.  I knew Laguerta had her head up her ass on that one.  She doesn't have shit on the real ice truck killer.  Good.  Why good? It's good for you.  You're gonna be the one to apprehend that heinous murderer, not her.    Thanks.    All right.  Good night, sister.    Don't stay up too late.    Okay.  Thanks for stopping by.    Hello?   Hi.  Are you   Is this a bad time? It's Rita.  No, it's fine.  Hi.  I was just reading a sad story.  Is everything okay? Yes, I'm   Look, the thing is You need me to pick up Cody after school? No.  Colleen's gonna take him to karate with Hudson.    What about Astor's piano?   Jen's got that covered.  Look, it's social services.  There's a caseworker coming by the house this afternoon.  I should be home by 4:00, but with the buses I'll be there.  Don't worry about a thing.  Thank you, Dexter.  As you all know, a night watchman from the hockey arena is missing.  Till now, we presumed he was abducted or murdered by the ice truck killer.  However, we searched his apartment and found a stolen surveillance tape from the night of the murder.  Chief of security at the hockey arena confirmed it.  The man you're looking at is Tony Tucci, the missing night watchman.  And here's the best part   Tucci has a record.  He pulled a knife at a party in '97.  Ladies and gentlemen, I give you Tony Tucci, the ice truck killer.  Bullshit.  Captain Matthews is coordinating with the FDLE* to launch a statewide manhunt as soon as we get clearances.  Does he drive a station wagon? Excuse me? Tucci   What kind of car does he drive? The last known victim was seen getting in a station wagon.  I don't recall asking for any questions, Miss Morgan.  Thank you.  Now, from this moment on, all our resources go to finding this man.  Your individual assignments will be coming shortly.  That's all for now.  Doesn't make sense.  After being so careful for so long, why would he leave recorded evidence? Of course I agree with my sister, but unlike her, I'm not upset.  He's still out there, and I'm waiting breathless.  You sure we can't get you anything? I'm fine.  Rita's usually home in time for the kids.  I'm just backup.  Her bus must be late.  My file says Miss Bennett's supposed to have personal transportation.  Yeah, well, she did and will again very soon.  Probably next week.  Nothing to worry about.  I just have to make a note of it.  She's doing an exemplary job.  I wish all my home visits were this lovely.  So why do you keep coming around, then? Routine follow up for all domestic violence cases.  We need to ensure a stable home environment exists.  It's a good thing.  The system does work from time to time.  I was actually taken in by a wonderful family.  No abuse.  In fact, my foster father understood I had special needs.  Without him You're lucky.  Lucky.  I'm here! Hey, everyone, I'm here.    Sorry.    It's okay.  I am lucky.  What do I know about abuse? Without the code of Harry, I'm sure I would've committed a senseless murder in my youth just to watch the blood flow.  Just try and keep him comfortable.  It's about all we can do for him now.  I don't understand.  A week ago, the doctor said he was getting better.  He is getting better, sweetie.  A body cannot suffer in sweet repose.  What does that mean? What the hell does that mean? She's weird.  Listen, you two I'm not going to be around much longer.  Dad, don't say that.  You can make it through this if you fight.  When I'm gone, I won't be able to stop you from being who you are.  Sooner or later, you'll need to do it.  Do what? Just remember our lessons.  What lessons? What are you talking about?   I can't make it without you.    Yes, you can.  If you feel like you're slipping lean on your sister.  She'll keep you connected.  Fucking forensics report.    What'd they find?   Tucci's hair and fiber.  Of course Tucci's hair and fibers are on the body.  He's hauling her around with his pork hands, isn't he? Any word from the chem lab? Same as the other murders.  The killer used liquid nitrogen to preserve the tissue, give it that bleached look.  You know how unstable liquid nitrogen is? You'd have to be a lab rat just to mess around with that shit.  Tucci didn't even pass high school chemistry.  Watch carefully.  Right there   see? Right before he repositioned the torso.  He turned his head.  Like someone's giving him directions.  Someone like the ice truck killer olding a motherfucking gun to his back.    The killer's framing Tucci.    It looks that way.  Laguerta's gonna lose her sheep shit when she finds out.  She's gonna have to cancel her press conference.  And you know how Laguerta loves her press conferences.  Can I borrow this tape? Bingo.  I know what happens next in this gruesome little scenario.  Jeremy is trying to re create his first kill, ritualize it.  You ready? I don't know if I want to do this, man.  What's wrong? I thought you wanted to see an alligator.  I do.  Come on.  It's in the marsh up here.    Wait.  Are you a pussy?   No.  Okay.  Where is this place, man? It's right up here.  Come on, Jer.  What are you talking about? Don't be a bitch.    Here we are.    I don't see it.  It's right there.  See its eyes sticking out? You have to get closer.  I still don't see it.  Really? Maybe I was wrong.  There's no gator here, is there? I don't know, Lucas.  Is there? Anyone see a frisbee? It flew in here somewhere.  Shit! Let's get the fuck out of here.  What am I doing out here? Oh, fuck! Fuck! Fuck! All I had to do was drive home, have a taco, plan my attack.  Instead, I tried to act human, like it's my job to save lives.  Code of Harry never covered this.  At least I know where Jeremy is and what I need to do.  Don't let her.  Okay, my brave little soldier.  Let's get this nasty shot out of the way.    No!   Wait!   What is it, honey?   He doesn't want the shot.  Your father's very sick.  He's in a lot of pain.  He needs a shot.    I want pain.    He wants pain.  I'll have to tell the doctor.  He's not going to be happy you're refusing your medication.  You can tell.  About the nurse? Yeah.  She's like me.  How could you tell? She gives too much morphine.  It's something else.  It's making me worse.  She's drugging you.  She's killing you by overdose.  Not just me.  Others, too.  Stop her.  What do you mean, stop her? It's time.  Before she hurts anyone else.  See the look on his face, like he's scared? Like he has a gun pointed at him? I don't know, Debra.  It's not much   a look off camera.  There's more.  One of my Vice contacts, Gabrielle   I trust her   she saw the victim get into a wood paneled wagon the night of the victim's death.  That was the last time anyone saw her.  Did a background report on Tucci.  He doesn't even own a car.  There's no fucking way this guy can be the ice truck killer.  Sir.  What does lieutenant Laguerta say about all this? I came straight to you, Captain.  You went around the back of your commanding officer? Laguerta doesn't listen to me.  Every time I open my mouth, You don't violate the chain of command.  You just don't.  Now, listen, Debra.  I gave you a shot in Homicide because I think you can make a halfway decent detective.  But if I find you can't swim in these waters, I'll put you right back on the street.  You got it? Yes, sir.  Your father never would've pulled the kind of shit you just did.  Did you know that one of your officers has information that casts some doubt on this manhunt of yours? Who, Morgan? I realize you're something of a folk hero around here, Maria, but it would be a mistake to ignore the work of a promising officer just to further your political career.  Is that what you think I'm doing? You were a middle of the pack detective before the press got ahold of you.  Thanks for the vote of confidence.  It's a reality check, and you need it.  And I got it.  Let's cut to the chase.  Are you telling me to call off my manhunt? 'Cause I will remind you that Jeb Bush himself signed off on it.  No No.  You go ahead and hold your press conference, Maria.  People of this city need to know we're doing something about this mess.  But don't expect me to bail you out if that night watchman turns out to be a dead end.  A statewide manhunt is under way right now in Florida.  According to police, a night watchman is on the run after the dismembered body parts of a young South Beach woman were found Tuesday, stacked on the home ice of the Miami Blades.  The woman is believed to be the latest victim of the notorious ice truck killer, now responsible for five deaths in the greater Miami area.  These terrible attacks have to stop.  And we have to stop them.  With Tony Tucci now linked to the murders, it's our mission to find him.  Fucking joke.  Hey, going out tonight with the guys, blow off a little steam   you in?   Hey, man, sounds good.    Pick you up at 8:00.  Elevator's around the corner and to your left.  Enjoy your stay with us.    Hello?   Rita, this is Mr.  Curtis.  Are you coming to pick up Astor? Oh, no, a friend of mine is   Denise.  Is she not there? I'm afraid not, but your daughter is.  She's the last kid left here at school.  I don't have a car.  Is she okay? Yeah, she's just fine, but we can't keep her here much longer.  Okay.  Okay, I'll work something out.  Do it again! Shh.  Let's not wake up Cody.  Now, let's see about that splinter.  That's a deep one.  This might sting a bit.  But the magical Splinter Fairy will soon make you forget all about it.  Who's the magical Splinter Fairy? She's the second cousin to the Tooth Fairy.  She brings candy if you put your splinter under your pillow at night.  The Tooth Fairy is make believe, just like the boogeyman.  Hi, guys.  You're right, Astor.  There's no such thing as the boogeyman.  But the Splinter Fairy   she's the real deal.  Will the Splinter Fairy come if I cry? Thanks for picking her up.  If I had a heart, it might be breaking right now.  Oh, sorry.  Who we picking up now, man? 'Cause he sure ain't sitting on my lap.  We're not picking up anybody, bro.  Well, what we doing in the Gables? I told you.  We're blowing off some steam.  This is it.  What the hell is this? It's a disguise.  One of Guerrero's top lieutenants   he lives here, and we're gonna fuck him up.  Hold up, Mac.  I thought you said you wanted to go out and get shit faced, man.  I am shit faced.  How do I look? Man, I'm all for sending the message, but this   This ain't the way, man.  Why the hell not? The guy's scum.  Mac, listen.  I've got to talk to you.  Mac, Mac! Hey, listen up, man.  I showed my face to Guerrero.  They gonna think I'm behind this shit!   That's part of the plan.    What plan? You fucked my sister.  You fucked a cop's wife.  Now you're just fucked, buddy.  Open the door! Shit.  Fuck.  Hey, quit fucking around.  Turn on the lights.  Come on, man.  Turn on the fucking lights! You're mine now.    What do you want?   Silence.  You gonna fuck me, faggot? 'Cause I killed the last guy who raped me.  What guy? He raped you The guy you killed when you were 15? Why didn't you tell anybody? Would you? He fucked me, and I killed him, and if you try, I'll kill you, too.  I understand now.  Why didn't I see it before? Jeremy didn't murder that boy four years ago.  He was taking out the garbage.  Just like I do.  Look, I really don't want to cancel all my credit cards, and I hate waiting in line at the DMV*, so give me back the wallet you stole from my car, or I'll break your fucking neck.  It's in my backpack.  Wait   Is that all? You want more? That boy who raped you four years ago   did he deserve to die? Yeah.  He did.  Well, the boy the other day didn't.  Remember that.  It could save your life one day.  Mr.  Tinker? Mr.  Tinker, where are you? Mr.  Tinker? Are you trapped behind the couch again, Mr.  Tinker stinker? The nurse was my first playmate.  I'll always be grateful to her for opening up so many magnificent new doors for me.  Things were a little messy in the beginning.  Hey, perfecting a new craft takes time.  But I was trained well.  Those who witnessed my early stumbles never had a chance to tell.  I've just been looking through your photo album.  Hope you don't mind.  Are all your victims in here? I'm sorry.  Let me help you with that.  Scream and lose a tongue.  I helped them All of them.  I took their pain away.  I understand.  Now it's time to take away your pain.  It was messier than I anticipated, but it was still a special day.  But, of course, it was really Harry who paved the road to my salvation.  With the nurse put down, Harry lived another year before hardening arteries squeezed the last bit of life from him, but his lessons have never failed me.  Harry taught me that death isn't the end.  It's the beginning of a chain reaction that will catch you if you're not careful.  He taught me that none of us are who we appear to be on the outside but we must maintain appearances to survive.  But there was something Harry didn't teach me, something he didn't know, couldn't possibly know.  The willful taking of life represents the ultimate disconnect from humanity.  It leaves you an outsider, forever looking in, searching for company to keep.  Sweet ride! Is it yours? It's yours, until your mom can get a new one.  I borrowed it from impound right before auction.    Dexter   Can we get in? You better.  All you can do is play along at life and hope that sometimes you get it right.  Thank you.  Score one for the little wooden boy.      Previous EpisodeNext Episode"

In fact, I think this is a friendly message, kind of like, \"hey, want to pla? \" Kara, it's me.  It's James.  You just opened a dangerous door.  No, man.  You did when you murdered a cop and an innocent lady.  Was Kara sleeping with someone other than Ricky? Was it you? What the fuck were you thinking? Going out tonight with the guys, blow off steam.  You in? Hey, man.  Sounds good.  I thought you said you wanted to go get shit faced.  I am shit faced.  I showed my face to Guerrero, to his whole church.  They're gonna think I'm behind this shit.  You fucked my sister.  You fucked a cop's wife.  Now you're just fucked, buddy.  He's escalating the thrill, posing his victim in the middle of a 20,000 seat arena for all Miami to see, to show us what he's capable of doing.  What did I miss?   Fingertips.    Fuckin' asshole, that's my girl.  This body belongs to the frozen fingertips in the truck.  Ladies and gentlemen, I give you Tony Tucci, the ice truck killer.  Bullshit.  Of course I agree with my sister, but unlike her, I'm not upset.  He's still out there, and I'm waiting breathless.  I find people around me are always making some kind of connection, like friendship or romance, but human bonds always lead to messy complications commitment, sharing, driving people to the airport.  Besides, if I let someone get that close, they'd see who I really am and I can't let that happen.  So, time to put on my mask.    I need your expertise.    I live to serve.  Excuse us, fellas.    Interesting hand job.    That's funny.  It is? So, how long you think it's been there? This feels familiar.  Okay.  So, how long has it been there? Blood stopped pooling, still wet couple hours at the most.  What time was it found? A jogger called it in this morning about 7:30.  No prints.  Wiped clean.  Real creep show, huh? Any sign of the rest of the body? Just Mr.  Hand.  Do you think this is our guy's work? The ice truck killer? It's hard to say.  There's blood.  That's different.  Plus, it's a male victim   haven't seen that before.  The cut appears to be almost delicate.  You see between the first and second row of carpals Very surgical.  Check out what else he left behind.  A little postcard to remember him by.    How far is Rand Beach from here?   This is Rand Beach.  It was renamed Petrie Beach a few years ago.  Okay, everybody.  Everybody say \"stinky feet\".  Stinky feet! Wait.  Nobody move.  Dexter, were you smiling?   No.    Okay, we'll do another one.  This time, everybody smiles.  You, too, Dex.  Yeah, pretend you're burning ants.    Shut your damn face, Deb.    Hey, language, please.  What? She always talks like that.  Enough, you two.  Dexter, come here.  What's your problem? I hate the beach.  It's sandy and gross and nasty, and I want to go home.  Too bad.  You're part of a family.  And being part of a family means smiling for photos.  Why should I pretend I'm happy? Because it'll make your mom happy, and because it's how you fit in.    Remember we talked about that?   Yeah.  This is how you do it.  When somebody takes your picture, you smile.  It doesn't matter if you're happy or not.  You just do it to fit in.  Okay?   Okay.    All right.  Come here, handsome.  Okay.  Everybody ready? One more time.  Stinky feet! Yeah, I just need to stop by my apartment to pick up a few labs.  Straight to the station after, yeah.  Thanks, lieutenant.  Dexter Morgan, this is your life.  It is my new friend   The ice truck killer.  When he broke into my apartment, he took some time to get to know me my life my secrets.  have even brought in manpower from other counties in an effort to expedite the search.  Officially, Mr.  Tucci has not been charged with any crime Then tell the fucking governor to free up funds for overtime.  I mean the more guys I got out there, the sooner we find Tucci.  Kelly, I'll get back to you.  What's wrong? Fingerprint I.  D.  came back on that hand from the beach.  It belongs to Tony Tucci, your ice truck killer suspect.  What? Wait a minute.  No.  No, no, no.  No way.  No way! I mean, this   This has to be a mistake! The mistake, Maria, was unleashing a high profile manhunt before you had all the facts.  Fuck! Okay.  This doesn't mean that Tucci is not the killer.  Don't! Just just don't.  You wanted to be on tv   well, get ready 'cause the press will annihilate us for this.  We'll be lucky if Tucci's mother doesn't file a lawsuit.  All right.  You go talk to that woman.  Do your mea culpas.  If we handle this right, maybe we can mitigate the fallout.  Tom! I'm the last person she wants to see.  I called her son a killer! And now's your chance to make it right.  So Laguerta screwed the pooch on this one, huh? I'm taking point.  You can help by getting all non essentials off the beach.  Secure and separate any witnesses, all right? Will do.  What did the Captain say? Did he make her cry? Just control the fucking beach, Angel.  I knew Tucci wasn't the killer.  I knew it.  Laguerta whipped up a manhunt for a rent a cop.  Man, I wish I could have been there to see the Captain rip her a new one.  Morgan, calm down.  Laguerta insulted the real killer's intelligence, and now he's getting back at us for chasing after the wrong guy.  You see all these people over here?   Yeah.    What are they? Potential witnesses.  And what do we do with potential witnesses, Morgan? We   we interview them.  Got it.  Where is he The rest of him? We're   we're still looking.  The entire force is looking.  We're making every effort.  Are you sure it's Tony? Because Yes.  I'm afraid so.  Mrs.  Tucci I said some very harsh things about your son.  Thank you.  \"Thank you\"? For what?   For coming to tell me in person.    For God's sake, please.  There's nothing more important than this.  Can you find my son's body? If it's the last thing I do.  I made a grave Bring him home, please.  I just want to bury my son.  I do love Halloween.    What's inside of a pumpkin?   See for yourself.  You don't like this stuff? I do.  Come on.  Get in there.  I'll finish cleaning this out.  You can carve it tomorrow.  There he is again, mom.  My god.  It's every night now.  That dog? Where's it coming from? Next door   My neighbor's.  Leaves the poor thing in the yard all day and night.  It's been getting worse.  I mean, I would talk to her, but I don't want to start something.  Listen to him, mom.  He's so sad.  I just wish he would shut up so I could sleep.  Do you want me to talk to her? No, you don't have to do that.  I insist.  Hello.  I don't think we've met.  Boyfriend of the blonde next door.  I've seen you around.  Look, I'm just getting in.  I'm tired.  That's precisely why I'm here.  We can't help but notice your dog, uh, cries a lot.  I know.  My ex moved out and left his dog.  Trust me, I wish there was something I could do.  You could, uh, take him inside.  Walter's an outside dog.  You put Walter inside, Walter's an inside dog.  He doesn't like being inside.  Did he tell you that? We'd really appreciate it if you could find a way to keep him quiet.  The kids are upset.  Maybe that's 'cause they think their crackhead father is gonna come back and beat their asses again.  You know what works for me? Earplugs.  I could make things so much easier for Rita but that would be wrong.  I love Halloween   the one time of year when everyone wears a mask not just me.  People think it's fun to pretend you're a monster.  Me, I spend my life pretending I'm not.  Brother, friend, boyfriend All part of my costume collection.  Some people might call me a fraud.  OK.  Let's see if it will fit.  You stabbed me in the back! I prefer to think of myself as a master of disguise.  They're so excited.  Sure they are.  They get to binge on sugar for an entire day.  Who wouldn't love that? What about a costume for you? Maybe this one? No.  No.  I think I'll be Snow White again.  It's kind of tradition.  Dexter, look.  I'm a princess, too.  Just like your mom   Two perfect princesses.  Let me guess.  You're gonna be a dwarf.  No way.  I want to be Joe from \"Blue's Clues.  \" I keep telling him that a rugby shirt is not a costume.  Another photo from my family album.  He's re creating my past with Tony Tucci's body parts.  He's forcing me to see this.  Nobody paying you to stand around and goddamn stare.  I thought Angel was working this case, Sergeant.  Sergeant? Friends of yours? Don't worry about it.  Worry about this.  The foot was severed between the tarsus and the metatarsus.  The wound is circular   again, almost surgical.  And there's blood.  Guy gives us body after body with no blood.    Why he's making a switch now?   He's trying to send a message One that's more important than his ritual need to drain the blood and wrap the parts.    Okay, so what's the message?   I'm not sure.    Well, who's he sending it to?   I can't tell you that, either.  What fucking good are you? No fucking good at all, apparently.    You okay?   He's mocking me.  Don't take it personally.  Doakes hates all you lab geeks.  Who?   Relax, bro.    Sorry.  I need to bag this photo under the ball.  Do you mind? He knows.  He's not corrupting the happy hallmark images of my youth.  He's revealing the ugly truth behind them.  Come on, Simon.  You want it? It's right there.  Over there.  Oh, yeah.    Guys, give it back!   Come on, Simon.  All right.  Enough.  Get out of here.    What the hell is going on?   We're just having fun.  It didn't look like Simon was having too much fun.  You're always telling me to fit in, and I'm just trying to be part of the team.  You can't be a bully, Dexter.  First of all it's wrong.  Secondly, people remember bullies.  People like me   cops.  A bully is a felony waiting to happen.    So   Blend in.  Go on.  Officer Morgan, I have an assignment for you.  Yeah, I heard we found a foot this morning.  You want me to head out to the crime scene? No.  Look, we pulled these from security cameras around the beach Stores, hotels, ATMs.  I want you to check every frame.  You are shitting me.  If we're lucky, we can see the ice truck killer coming and going.  We have techs who can do this.  Not all techs have the skill to spot suspicious activity.  I'm taking a huge leap of faith that you do.  And keep your eye out for another box of surveillance tapes.  It's on its way from the new crime scene.  Hey, Doakes, what's up? Fuck anyone's wife lately? Thanks to your little chickenshit stunt, Guerrero's guys are tailing me everywhere I go.  Did you know that? That's not good, James.  You should alert the police Unless, of course, for some reason the officers of Miami metro wouldn't want to help you like, you know, you fucked one of their wives.  You think this is a joke.  I'm gonna end up dead.  It's just a matter of when.  You should have thought of that before you stuck your dick in my sister.  You're right.  I should have waited until the divorce came through.  Bullshit.  What? She didn't tell you? She filed the papers, jackass.  You don't believe me, ask the Captain.  He tried to pull Ricky out of his assignment, but Ricky didn't want to come out.  Of course not.  His job was to bring down Guerrero.  It was his job to protect his wife.  Ricky's the motherfucker who got her killed.  You backed the wrong cop, asshole.  Let's go, guys.  Time for school.  Guys? Come on.  You don't want to be in the Halloween parade? Shut up! Shut up! Just   I need to talk to you about your dog.    I talked to your boyfriend.    My kids are exhausted.  All right, when it comes to my kids, I stop being nice.  So I need you to bring him in at night, feed him on a schedule, and take him for some exercise every now and I'm sorry.  Is this funny? No, no, no It's it's sad.  But you're funny.  Look at you, all tough.  I'm gonna call the police.  I can do that.  There's nothing you can do.  The cops will tell me to keep him quiet, and I'll say I will, and then they'll leave, and he'll go back to doing what he does.  But you're funny.  Unlike Harry, my new friend doesn't place much value in blending in.  He wants me to see who he is and what he does.  Everything about him is brazen, authentic.  What does that make me? Crap.    You okay, man?   No.  Hey, don't let this bastard get to you.  You're the best blood expert in the state, and we need you to stay with this, my friend.  I'll be all right.  Wait.  Before you get back to work, check this out.  What is that, a butterfly? No, socio, it's a diamond studded four leaf clover.  I'm I'm giving it to Nina for our anniversary tomorrow night.  Congratulations.  How many years? my lucky charm now.  Tin is the traditional gift, but I didn't think she'd want a tin clover.  No.  It's probably a good plan.  Are you sure that's not a butterfly? Well, it does kind of look like a bug.    This can't be right.    What's up? You see that? You see it? I don't know.  What do I see? The blood flow in the hand suggested the heart was still pumping   when it was severed.    Mean son of a bitch, no doubt.  But look at the foot.  It's the same blood flow, plus the lividity.  Look, it's the same bruising, same ashen color, same level of decomposition as the hand the day we found it.  But we found them a day apart.  I know.  Dios santo.  L.  T. , you got to listen to him.  It's the guard, Tucci I think he's alive.  What are you talking about? The ice truck killer is keeping him alive to perform amputations.  Tucci's alive? Both limbs were taken from a live body, and we found them 24 hours apart.  That's not all.  Tell them, Dexter.  If the hand came off yesterday at 7:00 A. M.  and the foot this morning at 7:00 We get another body part first thing tomorrow.  But he's alive.  Put together a task force.  I want all available personnel on this, and put a priority status on all forensics related to this case.  Captain Matthews, please.  Have him call me back immediately.  Mrs.  Tucci? Maria Laguerta.  I have some amazing news for you.  We believe your son is alive.  No.  No.  We haven't, but I promise we will.  No, thank you.  Yes.  Yes.  Okay, we'll be in touch.  Bye.  We've got a live body now, people.  We want to find Tucci while he's still breathing.  That means trying to figure out where tomorrow's drop is so we catch our man in the act.  Any ideas? Don't forget the photos.  They're new.  Thank you, officer Morgan.  We're doing just fine out here.  Why do we think he's taking photos? He wants to be remembered.  You use photos to record memories.  I almost feel sorry for them, trying to put together a puzzle when they don't know pieces are missing from the box pieces he gave me.  He wants me to play the game his way.  Okay, what else could it be? Change.  You got something to say, speak up.  The beach changed names.  The office park used to be a soccer field.  He's dumping the body parts in places that used to be something else.  Okay.  Places that have changed.  Let's make a list, assign surveillance to each location for the morning.  South beach used to be a mangrove swamp.  Homestead park was originally an air force base, right? They turned Versace's mansion into a hotel.  Thank you, officer Morgan.  The whole city of Miami reinvents itself every 5 years.  Then we'll stay up all night until our list is complete.  \"I once was lost \"But now I'm found, \"Was blind but now I see\".  Lieutenant.  Anything? Well, I am so glad you could make it.  Well, I just came by to show my support.  It's been a long time since I've been to church.  Excuse me, everyone.  Excuse me.  I would like to introduce you to someone very special.  This is Maria Laguerta.  She's the policewoman looking for Tony.  Not just me.  Actually, there's a lot of us looking.  You brought us all here together by giving us hope.  May the Lord bless you and guide you, Maria.  This is Saint Anthony,   patron Saint of   The lost.  Find him.  I tried to apologize, but I couldn't get a word in edgewise.  And you wanted to apologize why? You don't think I should, the way I went after her son? Yeah, you did fuck that up.  Yeah.  I crucified him without having all the facts.  I need to tell her that I'm sorry.  I need to let her know that I'm sorry.  I need to tell her.  Who is that gonna make feel better, you or her? Leave that woman alone with her candles and \"kumbaya\".  So, where we at? I added additional patrols at Dolphin Stadium, Bayside marketplace, and Casa Casuarina.  That's everybody we have out in the field   Homicide Robbery, off duty patrol.  So what's next? What's next is you should go home.  You've had the shit kicked out of you all day.  I like it here with you.  You're the only person people hate more than me.  Come on.  Let's both get out of here.  Nothing left but the waiting now, anyway.  Officer Morgan.  Call me on my cellphone if you find anything.  Son of a bitch.  Fuck this.  What? Want a piece of me? Fucking asshole! I will pay you $1 million if you help me figure out where the next piece of Tucci's gonna show up.  I'm afraid I'm lost on this one, Deb.  It's like it's staring me right in the face, but   $1 million.  You don't have $1 million.  I'll steal it from evidence.  I've been stuck in a goddamn fishbowl all day.  I want to be part of the hunt.    I'm almost off duty.    Sorry, sister.  $2 million.  I know you made a list of locations.  Just pick your favorite spot.  We'll stake it out together.  My favorite spot.  Of course.  Come on.  I want to play.  Deb, I got to go.  We'll compare notes tomorrow, okay? I used to love this place   The bulldozers pressing garbage, layer after layer, right into the earth itself, burying it, hiding it.  I found it soothing.  But it wasn't condos back then.  This has to be the right place.  So what am I missing? Sorry about that.  Go back to sleep.  Hello.  Mr.  Morgan? Dispatch.  You've been called to the McCaffrey pumpkin patch.    Do you need the address?   No, I know exactly where it is.  Are you okay? Are you kidding? That was awesome.  You've got some hay in your hair.    Where?   Right there! Okay, okay, okay, okay.  Enough.  Enough, you two.  Come on.  Let me take a picture of you and the kids.  You'll miss these moments when they're older.  Thanks.  It's great to see you having such a good time, Dex.  Are you kidding me? This hay's giving me a total allergy attack, and we're going around in circles on a pumpkin patch.  I don't get it.  Ready? Smile! What do we have? Ankle to knee.  He's moving up the leg.  You think Tucci's still alive? If he is, he won't be for long.  Unless you're toting a portable DVD player, you better be finished watching that security footage.  I am on break.  I'm on my own time.  So you are, but your shift starts in two hours.  So if I were you, I'd head back to the station.  Traffic at this hour's a bitch.  Speaking of bitch Didn't dad bring us here once when we were kids? I don't remember.  Hey, Dexter, come here.  Take a look at this.  Excuse us.  She's right, you know, about the traffic.  It's interesting.  There's no sign of infection where the foot was cut off, like he gave Tucci prophylactic antibiotics before amputating.  At least he's looking after his patient.  Hey, check this out.  Is this appropriate? It's our anniversary and it's the big one.  Nina deserves the best.  \"Ox\"? No.  Fuck! What's the matter with you? It's x's and o'S.  Like tic tac toe? No, like \"hugs and kisses\".  Diamond filled hugs and kisses in a white gold setting.  Well, that's good, 'cause you wouldn't want it to look like someone's playing tic tac toe on her head.  Goddamn it.  Where's mom? She had to run a few errands before she takes you two trick or treating.  But I'm too tired to go trick or treating.  I heard you two were up a lot last night.  It was that damn dog.  Hey, Code, grown up language is for grown ups.  I don't think that dog will be bothering you anymore.    How do you know?   My mystic powers told me.  Heard Lindsay Lohan say \"damn\".  All right, tell you what   I'll make you a deal.  When you become a rock star, you can swear, too.    Walter! Walter!   You're right.  He's gone.  Where's my dog?! What did you do with it?! All right.  Here he is.  Just remember to walk him, feed him, and love him, okay? My nieces are shy sometimes.  Girls, say thank you to Rita.  Thank you.  They already made a doggy bed   sweaters, towels.  It actually looks more comfortable than my bed.  I knew this would be a perfect fit.  You did a good thing, Rita.  Thank you.  Harry was the only one who saw me really saw me So he taught me to hide.  That's what's kept me safe.  But sometimes, I'm not sure where Harry's vision of me ends and the real me starts.  If I'm just a collection of learned behaviors bits and pieces of Harry maybe my new friend is right.  Maybe I am a fraud.    Hi.    Hey.  Where's Astor and Cody? They're passed out in a sugar coma at Colleen's.    Can I come in?   Yeah, sure.  Sorry.  I should warn you, I haven't really been myself lately.  Maybe I can cheer you up.  Trick or treat.  You look great.    Who are you?   Lara Croft.  \"Tomb Raider\".  You raid tombs dressed like that? That's impressive.  What happened to Snow White? Well, I'm   I'm sick of her.  You know, I never did get to thank you for picking the kids up for me.  You took care of your \"errand\"? Yes.  The beagle has landed happily in the arms of two loving girls.  You are a superhero.  It was such an incredible feeling rescuing that dog.  You upset your neighbor.  Fuck her.  Well, I guess you're used to dealing with people like her, right? Considerably worse.  Is that why you haven't been yourself lately? There's a case I just can't seem to get out of my mind.  Maybe I can help.  No.  I'm afraid there's nothing you can do.  Oh, I don't know.  I'm a dognapper now and a tomb raider.  There's all sorts of things I can do.  What   what are you doing? Whatever I want.  I've come to appreciate the comfortable moments with Rita The easy, quiet moments  This might be better.  Look, there's Mr.  Tub of Lardy bringing Mrs.  Tub of Lardy another bucket of fried chicken.    Where's your brother?   I'm not his keeper.  What do you think of this? It's an anniversary present for Nina.  See, it's it's a diamond key to my heart.  It's it's a key, but, you see, it's shaped like a heart.  You can't tell me that it looks like anything else, 'cause that's what it is.  That's it.  That's what I like.  And I'm not gonna take it back.  It's perfect, Angel.  She'll love it.  Really? I would.  How How do I look? Like the tie? Angel.  Happy anniversary, baby.  You know you can't just walk in here anymore.  I just thought our anniversary Maybe tonight we could put all that behind us.  It doesn't matter what night it is.  I told you I need time.  It's been three months, baby.  How much time do you need? Don't turn this around on me, Angel not after what you did.  I need as much time as I need.  Angel As long as you're here, you want to see Aury? Lo siento, princesa.  Lo siento, lo siento, lo siento.  Thank you.  That was unexpected.  Yeah.  For me, too.  I have no problem with unexpected.  No, you certainly don't.  I have to get back to the kids.  What are these? I've been reorganizing my photos a little.  Look how cute you are.  And your dad   such a nice face, just like you.    I was adopted.    I know.  But you're both good men.  I can tell.  Very poetic.  Poetic? It's a water fountain.  Well, yeah, but look at the way your dad took the photo.  His shadow's on the wall right next to you.  It's like he's always with you.  I'd frame this one.  All this time the answer was right here.  Harry photographer and foster father extraordinaire.  He is always with me, and he's the common denominator.  Rita you're a genius.  All those years of smiling for the camera It was empty and fake, the pictures meaningless, until now.  Pictures of Harry.  So this is it.  It's cool.  Cool.  Dexter, this is the place where my father, your grandfather, worked for 30 years.  He started out as the janitor, worked his way up to chief of maintenance.  This place put food on our table.  In two weeks, it'll all be shut down.  I know.  Excuse me, miss! Miss?   Would you mind?   Oh, come on, dad.  Hey, you all right? It's nothing.  Bad medianoches for lunch.  I'm okay.  I'm sorry, miss.  It's okay.  Thanks.  We're not gonna be needing a picture, after all.  Yeah, we are.  Dex, I really don't feel like doing this now.  Don't be a baby   Being part of a family means smiling for family photos, right? My friend left this.  He's showing me where to go.  Am I going because it's what he wants or because that's what Harry would want? What do I want? The hospital's shut down now, abandoned for years, but tonight it's visiting hours again.  Well, James Why did you have to be such a pain in the ass, huh? Fuck! I didn't tell you you could get up.  Please, please.  Now you get up.  You traumatize my little girl in church break the knees of my best turner.  You're a wild dog, Sergeant.  The only thing to do with a wild dog Police! Hands in the air! Thought you could use backup.  You could have filled me in, man.  Shit.  Got you going after a goddamn cop, motherfucker.  We own your ass now.  So this was the plan all along To use me as bait to bring down Guerrero? Yeah, and now my sister can rest in peace.  We're done now, Doakes.  We're even.  I'll call this in, bring the paramedics.  Get this piece of shit out of here.  Please.  Just do it.  Kill me.  I'm ready.  Just don't cut me anymore.  Please don't cut me anymore.  Gift wrapped and begging for death.  Tools at the ready.  Just kill me.  It's okay.  He was left here so I would kill him, but my new friend doesn't see me as clearly as he thinks.  I can't kill this man.  Harry wouldn't want it.  And neither would I.  Are you Morgan? Message came through dispatch for you.  Who left this? Who left it?! Jesus, stop that.  I'm getting bruises.  I'm sorry.  I'm so excited.  Try a hug once in a while.  I don't know who your contacts are, Morgan, but you are my up and comer.  You saved a man's life tonight.  I'm just the one who got the call, Sir.  But you followed it up.  Right place at the right time, Sir.    Where we at?   Morgan's tip was good.  They're taking Tucci over to county.    Alive?   Alive.  So, I suppose this gets Deb off of surveillance tape duty.  Really? Is that what you suppose? I got your page, Lieutenant.  Doakes is caught up in the Guerrero bust.    You're taking point here.    You got it.  I'm tired of chasing this guy's shadow.  I want forensic evidence.  I don't care if you have to tear apart this building brick by brick.    Entiende?   Si.  Use Morgan here.  How did your wife like that necklace, Angel? Oh, you were right.  She loved it.  You nailed that one.  Everyone hides who they are, at least some of the time.  Sometimes you bury that part of yourself so deeply that you have to be reminded it's there at all.  Good work, man.  I told you we'd get that piss poor And sometimes you just want to forget who you are altogether.  And what about me? Maybe I'll never be the human Harry wanted me to be.  But I couldn't kill Tony Tucci.  That's not me, either.  My new friend thought I wouldn't be able to resist the kill he left for me, but I did.  I'm not the monster he wants me to be.  So I'm neither man nor beast.  I'm something new entirely, with my own set of rules.  I'm Dexter.      Previous EpisodeNext Episode"

Laguerta insulted the real killer's intelligence, and now he's getting back at us for chasing after the wrong guy.  It's the guard   Tucci.    I think he's alive.    Tucci's alive? The ice truck killer is keeping him alive to perform amputations.  He's sending me a message.  He wants me to go there.  Please.  He was left here so I would kill him.    Just kill me.    I can't kill this man.  Taking Tucci over to County alive.  I don't know who your contacts are, Morgan, but you are my up and comer.  You saved a man's life tonight.  The thing that surprises me most about Rita is how much I like being with her.  There's all sorts of things I can do.  What   what are you doing? Whatever I want.  My new friend thought I wouldn't be able to resist the kill he left for me, but I did.  I'm not the monster he wants me to be.  I'm Dexter.  I like to pretend I'm alone, completely alone, maybe post apocalypse or plague, Whatever   No one left to act normal for, no need to hide who I really am.  It would be freeing.  Stop grinning like a fucking psycho and get back to work.  Sorry, sergeant.  I was just waiting for forensics to wrap up before I tear the bed apart.  I'm not the only one who enjoys isolation.  My shadow companion chose this place well.  This was his sanctuary, for a while, at least.  All these people pawing over it seems disrespectful.  Tell me the sick bastard bled on something, Dexter.  He was here for days, playing with sharp objects.  I'll keep looking, but so far this place is spotless, amazingly so.  The only blood I found belongs to the security guard.    Has he said anything yet?   Mr.  Tucci's still unconscious.  Lieutenant, up here! There's got to be something here.  Find it.  The guy's not a ghost.  Tony Tucci is evidence of that.  Hey, Dexter, you get all this blood on camera yet? It's like shooting a Jackson Pollock.  Well, your Jackson Pollock is in the bag.  Ready? Okay.  What was that?   Did you see that?   What? Damn rats.  We're all gonna get histoplasmosis from all their shit in the dust.  We'll be coughing up blood, skin lesions, mouth sores.  Lovely.  Can we get the lights, guys? You ever heard of rat bite fever? Masuka, what'd I say about the fucking rats? You haven't found anything, won't find anything.    This is a bust, right?   In so many words.  Which means I'm just jerking off till Tucci wakes up.  So take a break.  You've been working this thing 24 7.  Or are you still avoiding a personal life? Oh, fuck you.  And, yeah, I'm better off just focusing on the job.  Thanks, guys.    It doesn't have to be either/or.    Maybe not for you.  If I found someone, so can you, right? Yeah, the trouble is keeping them.  Tell me about it.  Yelina? Are you okay? I'm sorry.  I'm fine.  Ernesto hasn't arrived?   I'm sure he'll be here soon.    No.  The coyote wanted more money, and I didn't have it.  Coyote? You mean the man you paid to bring him here? He said he sent Ernesto back to Cuba.  But that was a week ago, and no one in C\u00e1rdenas has heard from Ernesto.  Yelina, how did you contact this coyote? This was his number, but it's not working anymore.  I was supposed to leave him money in a park.  Listen, my boyfriend works for the police.  I'm sure he   No, no, no.  We can't go to the police.  He said he'd hurt my family in Cuba.  No, it's okay.  It's okay.  Dexter will know what to do.  I feel just terrible for her.  And they were supposed to be married after he got here.  I do know someone in the department who deals with immigration issues.    I can talk to him.    That's really kind of you, Dex.  I mean, can you imagine not knowing if your fianc\u00e9e is dead or alive? Uh, no.  Every night after work Yelina goes across the street, to the beach.  I've seen her there, just staring out at the water, willing him to walk out of it.  Have you ever longed for anything like that? She wants something from me.  Ever since the blow job, she assumes we've taken it to the next level.  She doesn't know yet   I don't have a next level.  Well, when I was a kid, I would have killed for an Atari.  You know? Cody would laugh at the graphics now, but back then, man It always comes to this once sex is introduced.  Small talk no longer cuts it.  Eventually she'll call me a science project and slam the door in my face.  But when do you think he'll wake up? Yeah, I did call an hour ago, but there's a killer out there that's into whores and security guards, but I'll bet nurses are next.  Yo, check you, all \"MPD Blue.  \" Shanda, what are you doing here? You have another lead on the ice truck killer? Man, I got bigger worries than that sick shit.  Now, I got me a girl on the inside, right? I'm not springing your pimp, if that's what you're after.  Oh, hell, no.  But my landlord's another fucking story   Trying to kick me out of my home.    Shanda.    He got no cause, except he's a born again hypocrite motherfucker.  Yeah, and you want me to talk to him? No, I want you to beat in his pasty, white face.  M organ.  Found this in evidence.  Masuka was gonna grease it through.  A cigarette butt? Jesus, we could pull DNA off of that, or even a print.  Except it would be your print.  You were smoking on a crime scene.  Not on the crime scene   like on the way far end of the park.  The whole area's a crime scene.  You should know that by now.  Maybe you ought to just calm the hell down, my brother.    Who the fuck is that?   Give it a rest, Shanda.  Morgan, go do something useful.  Go sit on that security guard until he wakes up.  And do not talk to him without me! Believe me   your maid is not the first one to get screwed.  No, she's a maid.  She's not my maid.  So, have you heard of any other Cuban immigrants disappearing? A few.  The poor bastards.  They spend their life savings, get stuffed into a fishhold, puke the whole 90 miles to Miami.  Then they get here, thinking, \"I'm an American.  I'm free.  \" Except the damn coyote He won't let them go till his family comes up with a surprise release fee.    If they can't pay   They disappear.  Freedom's just another word for one more way to get fucked.  Sounds like someone's doing something very bad.  You have any suspects? Sure, four or five, mostly Cubans themselves, but not enough evidence for a conviction or even a warrant.  If warrants were applied for, their names will be in the database.  Look, buddy I know you want to help out your maid, but there ain't a hell of a lot you can do.  You'd be surprised.  Jorge Castillo   number 3 on the department's list of suspects, but the only one even remotely close to the park where Yelina was supposed to drop the money.  They never got enough evidence for a search warrant, but I don't need permission to keep an eye on this guy.  No neighbors, no foot traffic   It's promising.  A good place for human trafficking or worse.  Excuse me.  Private yard.  I'm just praying you have a '69 Stingray headlight somewhere in here.  Dave Cutler.  Castillo.  I'm sorry, but I don't.  Man, my restoration's almost done.  She's a beauty.  I don't do individual sales, Mr.  Cutler, but I can give you the name of a Corvette shop I deal with.  I'll be happy to look around myself.  No offense, man, but I can't take my phone orders   if I'm watching over my merchandise.    You run this whole place alone? Yeah, it keeps my costs down.  Hey, I'm sorry you made the trip out here.  You know what? Try Wexler's, out in Tamarac.  That's my vette guy.  Yeah.  Must be nice being your own boss   Get out in the water whenever you want.  I saw that floater on your key chain.  I got to get one of those.  Lost my keys overboard twice in the past year.  I do a little fishing.  I got a 32 foot Concept.  What about you? I got a rowboat with a hole in it.  A lo major los pescados te encuentran.  I don't speak Spanish, sir.  Sorry.  I just assumed you were Cuban.  American, pal, just like you.  Just like me.  He's on heavy sedatives at the moment.  I think he deserves them.  I'll wait.  Hey.  Mr.  Tucci.  T ony.  I'm gonna find this cocksucker.  I swear.  I don't understand America's obsession with cars.  I can just imagine squeezing Rita and the kids into that thing and hitting the open road   Cramped quarters, public bathrooms, hours of nothing but conversation.  It's someone's American dream   my nightmare.  This must be where Castillo locks them up.  But if he's killing them when they can't pay, he's not doing it here.  So where are they?   Dexter Morgan.    Gerard here.  There's a floater down in South Beach morgue.  Could be a match for your maid's fianc\u00e9.  She's a maid.  She's not my   Is it all right if I bring her down? The sooner, the better.  Okay, then.  Thanks.  Have a good day.  Tonight at the Salsa Room.  You got to help me celebrate my pay grade bump.  Actually, I have a personal project I'm working on tonight.  Blow it off.  I'm buying.  Angel, do you have that list of prioritized witnesses? I can't deal with I'm working on it.  Well, how about you stop talking and earn your bump? Sexy.  Don't leave me hanging tonight, bro.  It's you and me.  I wonder what I did to make him think we're so close.  I wonder if it'd work on Rita.  Dexter Morgan   I called earlier.    Oh, right, yeah, about the floater.    Yeah.  Hey, Jerry, can you take these guys around back? Should I? Nah, I'll go with her.  She might need a shoulder.  She senses I'm not a shoulder.  Bad sign   She's catching on.  I don't know what kind of idiot thinks an inner tube is gonna get him over 90 miles of open ocean.  If you ask me, man, it's Darwin's theory at work.  That must be what love looks like.  The inability to feel has its advantages sometimes.    Hey, Dexter.    Hey, Mindy.    Do you need any help?   No.  So, are you gonna go to the spring formal? Why would I want to do that? She wanted you to ask her to the dance, Dexter.  That's not what she said.  Well, you have to learn their signals.  Yeah, well, I don't really care about girls.  I just like being alone.  But most normal people don't, and it's important that you seem normal.  Even though I'm not.  Because you're not.  We'll start you off with a temporary prefab and then make adjustments as we go.  Rudy here's gonna put me back together again, good as new.  Half the battle is attitude, and you have a great one.  Well, I'm alive.  I didn't see that happening, but here I am.  Yo, pretty boy, you're stealing my thunder, and I got a hottie waiting on me, so I don't know.  I just might have to fight you for this one.  Okay, we'll arm wrestle later.  Now get out of here.  Watch out for this guy.  He's a dog.  Excuse me.  I know what you need, guys, but I didn't see much.  Well, any detail will help, Mr.  Tucci.  Well He came up on me from behind, and he wore a mask when he made me put the the the things on the ice.  Gosh I'll get it.  Angel of mercy.  Just how merciful are you? You are a dog, aren't you? So the ladies tell me.  Can you tell us how tall he was or if he was black, white, latino? White, I think.  I'm guessing maybe average height   Not fat, not thin, just average.  I don't know.  And when he started, you know, working on me, I was blindfolded, so Did you hear anything? Did he have an accent or anything? He didn't talk much, or he'd whisper.  And that's all you heard? Except the rats.  Sometimes they would crawl up on the bed, and I'd have to shake them off.  Some crap ass witness I am, huh? You're doing fine.  You've given us a lot.  Yeah? You know, sometimes when I'm trying to remember something, I close my eyes.  Really? We could even blindfold you again.  I'm kind of tired right now.  It's okay.  Get some rest.  Officer Morgan and I are leaving.  Alone.  No pretending.  No hiding.  No time to relax.  I'm too close.  Jorge Castillo is bad.  That I know.  But bad enough to have killed Yelina's fianc\u00e9? That I have to prove.  Jorge's not so humble abode.  Yeesh   new money.  Normal people dream of this   A new car, a big home, a boat at the reef shore marina . .  and a beautiful wife.  Too bad   I never enjoy making someone a widow.  They're so happy.  She has no clue who she's with.  Maybe that's the secret to a successful relationship.  Mr.  Perry, you were on the grounds of the same hospital where we found Mr.  Tucci.  And you were alone that night? It was just me and Caesar, my dog.  He likes abandoned buildings.  Caesar's a ratter.    What did this guy do?   Why? Does he look familiar? Yes, he looks like an actor from that John Singleton movie.  What was that? How about you focus on whether or not he was the man you saw at the old hospital that night, Mr.  Perry? Well, it was difficult to tell.  It was dark.  You said you got a look at him.  He had a cap.  Hey, is that KG 230 hooked into a digital CCTB network? Ooh, you better have a hell of a firewall.  You get better resolution with the 440.  Hello.  We're done here.  Give me a minute.  Morgan, thank Mr.  Perry for his horseshit and send him home.  Christ on a crutch, he could tell us something.  Sergeant Doakes says he is a looky loo.  We get dozens like that every time a story hits the news.  Now do me a favor   Get him out of my precinct.  Thank you.  You could try being a little more optimistic.  I mean, if Tony Tucci can be optimistic, I think we can.  You might get more out of people.  How do you know Perry doesn't know anything? Because I've been doing this a lot longer than you.  Okay.  This case is getting colder every minute you waste on bullshit like Perry.  And wanting to blindfold a trauma victim? What the fuck were you thinking? Tucci's closed for business now, and you shut him down.  I I was trying a new approach.  Maybe you should just learn the basics before you reinvent the damn wheel.  Come on.  How can you not dance to this? It's a gift.  We just need some more patr\u00f3n, compadre.  Another round! No more for me.  I got to get up early   Killers to catch.  Forget that.  The night's just beginning, right, ladies? Yes! Ladies, excuse us.  Angel, come here.  Your wife   She's probably worrying.  I don't know what she'd think of your new friend.  She don't mind who I flirt with as long as I bring home la pasion.  La pasi\u00f3n? Yeah, it keeps the relationship alive.  What about communication, trust?   La pasi\u00f3n.    Wait.  What if she wants something more? Then you reciprocate   You know La pasi\u00f3n.  No, I meant what if she wants something more emotionally? Don't go down that emotional road.  Just go down on her.  It's easier, and she'll be distracted.  Come on.  Let's dance, Angel.  So What do you want to do now? Dance with her, Dexter.  Be polite.  Get her punch.  Open the door for her.  And if you find yourself alone with her and things get romantic   Dad, I've kissed a girl before.    You have?   Yeah.    And?   I don't know, it was okay.  Dexter, women are different from men.  We've had this talk, dad.  I'm saying they have a whole different experience of things.  When they're with someone, physically, they feel connected.  And they know when you're not.  They can sense it because you're very exposed.    Yeah, you're naked.    I mean emotionally.  Son, this is going to be very dangerous for you.  I can fake it.  Buddy, you can learn to fake a lot of things.  This is a tough one.  Is this it? Angel, I've only been here one time.  I don't remember.  Wake up.  Your wife's gonna love me.  The problem with acting normal is normal people get into stupid situations like this.  You scared the hell out of me.  Sorry, Nina.  I'm Dexter.  You remember? I work with Angel down at the station.  What are you doing here? It's funny.  We were out celebrating Angel's pay grade bump.    He got a raise?   Yeah.  Well, as you can see, he had a little too much to drink, so I gave him a ride home.  He doesn't live here anymore.  We're separated.  So good night.  Oh, okay.  Good night.  La pasi\u00f3n.  Angel.  Angel, we're really late for work, amigo.    I guess I had one too many, huh?   And then about 10 more.  How did I end up here? You don't remember?   So you live here, huh?   I live here.  You're kind of neat, aren't you? Bad habit instilled by mom.  We better get going.  Pressure's on with this ice truck killer situation.  Yeah.  You go ahead.  I'll lock up.  I have to stop by home anyway.  My wife's gonna be worried.  She gets so hot and bothered, you know women.  No, I'll just wait, and I'll drop you at your car.  Where's your bathroom? Somehow it's reassuring to know I'm not the only one pretending to be normal.  I found hair on this one that doesn't belong to Tucci   Rat hair.  I probably picked up a parasite just   Don't test me, Masuka.  You see all that shredding? Half of this sheet must be lining their nests.  They took evidence away from the crime scene?   Exactly.    So we check their nest.  Wild goose chase, without knowing what we're looking for.  We could talk to Tucci again.  He knows more than he thinks, and my gut tells me he can take it.  'Cause you got the instincts of a veteran on the force.  Masuka, run the sheet.  See if we can trace it to manufacturer.  I've got court in the morning, so call me on my cell   All right, I get it.  I'm a newbie.  But you are old and tired, and you need new eyes on this.  So when you're ready to let me do my job, you let me know.  And don't you fucking say a word, Masuka.  How do you get rid of the ones who don't pay out? You drop them in the middle of the ocean, tell them to swim for shore? You can't hide for long, Jorge.    Hello?   Dexter, it's me.  Look, I'm sorry I haven't talked to you since that place.  The morgue.  Do you think they'll be able to catch whoever did this? I'm sure he'll get what he deserves.  How are you doing? Still a little shaky.  I have some late night work I have to do, but I could stop by earlier if you want.    Maybe we could rent a movie.    Yeah, I'll pick up a DVD   Something light.  Maybe if I don't blink, my eyes will tear up.  I hate this.  I'm questioning every move.  It's exhausting.  I should just break it off already, unless I can pacify her, give her something, Reciprocate.  La pasion.  Dexter? I'm sorry.  I I was just You were so generous with me.  I was gonna return the favor.  No, that's very sweet, but Sorry, I'm just not in the mood for that.    That you, Dex?   Yeah.  Sorry I'm late.  It's okay, son.  You must have been having fun.    No, I pretended to.    That's good, Dexter.  Dad? Do you think that maybe one day I'll you know, feel it for real? I hope so, son.  I really do.  Alone, I'd be better off.  Relationships are too confusing.  But this I can figure out.  This I do well.  Jorge Castillo's boat.  If he's a killer, then there's proof.  There's always proof, and I'll find it.  Happy and in love The perfect couple.  I wonder if Rita and the kids would like fishing.  Focus.  If one of these matches the contact number for Ernesto's coyote, you're it, Jorge.  He drowns them here, then dumps them out there.  If they wash up, it'll be chalked up to another inner tube mishap.  Yep   This I do well.  Think about his shoes.  Did he walk with a limp? Did he move smoothly, like an athlete? Try to remember, Tony, for me.  I would if I could, hon.  You're a sweet lady, and smart   using your charms on me.  No, no, I don't mind.  It's probably the last time a woman will flirt with me, looking like this.  It's okay, Tony.  Maybe later.  We should try the blindfold.  What?   I. .  don't want to do that.    I'm sorry, Mr.  Tucci.  I can't even begin to imagine what you've been through, but it's our job to make sure that nobody else goes through it, too.  So, Morgan, you're up.  He was hard to hear.  I never knew where he was.  So he's agile.  That's good, Tony.  What else did you hear?   Rats.  Always those damn rats.    Try to focus on him, Tony.  What did you hear? What did you smell?   Menthol.    Menthol? Yeah, like cough drops.  He cleared his throat a lot.  You know, like   He unwrapped them.  I could hear those wrappers, that crinkly sound.  And he sucked on them.  I could hear them clicking against his teeth when he The son of a bitch loved those fucking lozenges.  Nothing in this nest.  Well, check another floor.  They're all over this dump.  Fuck this.  Masuka.  We got another one over here.  Promising.  Several fragments from the sheet here.  These rat bastards were repeat customers.    Who had garlic for lunch?   I'm gonna punch you in the neck.  Actually I think you're gonna French me.  2934.  I like being right.  I usually am, about these things.  \"Be prepared\"   It's my motto.  The boy scouts and I have that in common.  Of course, there's no merit badge for tonight's outing.  What are we looking at? They found the ice truck killer's lozenge wrapper, thanks to your sister.  Lozenge wrapper? Hey, after two months of finding fuck all in this case, a lozenge wrapper's the damn holy grail.  My favorite serial killer is a lozenge eater.  How human of him.  We have a partial.  Partial print   A partial fucking print! Proud of you, sis.  Hey, it's a celebration here.  Where are you going? Crime scene.  Excuse me.  What's, uh   What's going on? We've got our first piece of tangible evidence on the ice truck killer.  A partial fucking print.  You run it through AFIS yet? It doesn't even matter if we get a match.  He gets pulled in for something, anything, we got him.  We get it photoed before we scan it.  And I want Label to ID the point of comparison before you do the AFIS hit.  Masuka, I want that being swabbed for DNA.  And let's keep working the old hospital site, people.  You never know.  We might get lucky again.  It wasn't luck.  Good work, Morgan.  Afuera, va.  Muevanse.  Come on.  Come on! Entrar, entrar.  God bless America.  Hon? Where are you? Honey? Honey, you in here? Iderrito a mi familia! Get back in there, you Cuban piece of shit! Fucking animals.  Incredible.  They're even better matched than I thought   True partnership.  You know, I rarely deviate from a plan, but I just didn't have the heart to split up such a perfect couple.  You two have quite a lucrative operation going.  You're a really good team.  It's clever, too.  No one questions another drowned Cuban man or woman or child.  So, which one of you thought this up? They get freedom.  We free them.  They thank us, for God's sake! For drowning them and dumping their bodies in the ocean? Please.  We can pay you.  We have money.  That's what it's all about, right?   I love you.  I love you so much.    I love you so much.  I'm gonna ask you a question.  I want you to answer me honestly.  No more bullshit.  Do you understand?   How long have you been married?   12 years.  How do you love each other? You're like me, and you make it work.  How?   We want the same life.    We both   We want the same thing.    You share the same dream.    Yes, exactly, yes.  Yes, that's it.  That's helpful.  Thank you.  No.  I like doing things properly, but I'm out of time, and I still have to dispose of them.  Valerie got short shrift.  But all in all, it was a very good night.  I like this place.  A lot of memories are buried down there.  Deviating from the plan may have been ill advised.  But sometimes you just have to take a risk.  After all isn't that what relationships are all about? Do you have a dream for your life Your future, I guess? Of course.  Do you? It might sound weird.  I want to someday be content and just feel comfortable, like everyone else.    I want   A normal life.  Yeah, a normal life.  That's all I want.  Just that.  No fame and fortune?   excitement at every turn? No, I've had enough excitement.  Thank you.  Now I'll take boring.  Average.  Ordinary.  That's weird, huh? Yeah.      Previous EpisodeNext Episode"

When he broke into my apartment, he took some time to get to know me   My life, my secrets.  Paul doesn't live here anymore.  No shit.  He's in jail.  But See, he still owes me for two ounces of blow, which means you owe me.  The coyote wanted more money, and I didn't have it.  Poor bastards   Spend their life savings, get stuffed into a fishhold.    They can't pay   They disappear.  Jorge Castillo   The only suspect even remotely close to the park where Yelina was supposed to drop the money.  Excuse me.  Private yard.  Sorry, I just assumed you were Cuban.  American, pal, just like you.  Just like me.  Co\u00f1o.  Come on.  Get back in there, you Cuban piece of shit.  They're even better matched than I thought.  Fucking animals.  God bless America.  Taking the extra time to kill Valerie may have been ill advised.  My life has always been a sequence of carefully planned moments.  But sometimes you just have to take a risk.  Life is so fleeting, so fragile.  Every breath the potential to be our last.  You ready? Can I have my cereal now? We all grieve in our own way.  Sure.  I prefer the 6 year old approach.  Yet another I've sent to a watery grave.  Well, not quite.  Hey, what about this one? I want angel cake.  It's angel food, stupid, and you don't get a vote.    It's my birthday.    Guys.  So how'd it go? Bob the goldfish   May he rest in peace.  Thanks for coming over and taking care of this for me.  Dead stuff I know.  Well, go have a seat.  Your treat for coming over early is on its way.  I don't get birthdays   The party, the song.  Celebrating another year just being alive feels forced.  That one! That's the one I want.    Coconut it is.    I hate coconut.  You've never had coconut.  It's dispatch.  I might have to settle for toast to go.  Morgan.  Sure, what's the location? I'll be right there.  The crime scene.  My crime scene.  I shouldn't have killed them both.  I didn't have enough time.  A footprint, a microscopic drop of blood   What did I leave behind? Impossible.  Nice place setting, huh? We're running her prints now.  It had to be him.  He's watching me.  Dex? Good.  I. D.  the victim.  You find anything else? That ain't enough? Any eyewitnesses? Just do your job.  Worry about the blood.  You gonna answer that? This tin can smells like ass.  The sooner you get busy, the sooner we can finger who did this.  You heard the man.  He dove 100 feet to bring up the body.  He's getting back at me for not killing that security guard.  Please tell me this wasn't the ice truck killer.  I've got the press sniffing outside already.    No, it's not his M. O.    We got an I. D.    Valerie Castillo.  And guess this.  Her husband, Jorge, owns the salvage yard.  Then, try and track him down.  Sir, we found something.  You got anything? No bruising.  Nothing under her nails.  She didn't put up a fight.  If she was killed here, which I doubt, whoever did it was a real pro.  Under normal circumstances, I'd take that as a compliment.    Prints?   She's clean.  This trailer   That's another matter.  I don't even want to know what some of those stains are.  Yo, Dex, I think I found something.  Zoom in on this, will you?   I'm kind of low on batteries here.    Dude, it'll take, like, two seconds.  Yo, what's up with you today? You're throwing off my Chi.    You're not Chinese.    I'm not? Look, right here.  Does that look like a needle mark to you? It's more like a bug bite, blemish maybe.  Yeah I guess.  I'll let the coroner bag her.  I'm hungry.  This ain't no auto garage.  Oh! Oh, god.  Oh, I didn't need to see that.  You never seen a latrine before, Morgan? Yeah, just not indoors.  Well, the army taught me a lot of things.  I feel a Desert Storm story coming on.  Digging holes for people to take a dump? That was most important.  I'm not really getting that.  It doesn't matter how many bars you got on your collar, Morgan.    Everybody's shit stinks.    Here we go.    We were partners a long time.    From the looks of things, Valerie Castillo's better half was knee deep.    You like the husband for this?   It's always the husband.  What have you got? It looks like a phone number and a name   Mariel.  Call it in to Batista.  He can run it down for us.  Sergeant Doakes! We heard movement in the trunk.  I got it.  I got it.  Padre nuestro que est\u00e1 en los cielos.  Santificado sea tu nombre.  Venga tu reino.  H\u00e1gase tu voluntad en la tierra You all right, kid? Come on, man.  No! Subtle.  Maybe you should cuff him.  Mi hijito, todo est\u00e1 bien.  Te vamos a ayudar.  The noose is tightening.  This is how it ends   In the hands of a 7 year old? Hey, Deb.  I usually like kids.  Who's the boy? All we got so far is that he's Cuban and he seems to like Laguerta.  Spend enough time in a hot trunk, I guess she'd look good to anybody.  Did he you know? see anything? I'm not sure.  He's pretty out of it.  Social services is on the way.  You okay? You got a whole brow thing going on.  Morgan, bring some water! I love her.  Maybe I should spend some time in a hot trunk, too.  My neat little world of lies is crumbling all around me, and I can't tell a soul, especially not Deb.    Deb, we've been through this.    But I have my books.  I mean, I could just stay in the car or I can walk with you guys.  I promise I'll be quiet.  You won't even know I'm there.  The pheasants will know you're there.    But Dexter was my age when     Deb, that's enough.  The Logans are waiting.  Did you pack your swimsuit?   Yes.    Good girl.  I want to see that backflip when we come home.  All right.  Go on out to the car.  We'll be there in a sec.  She does kind of have a point, dad.  What we do on these weekends your sister can never know about.  Keeping the truth from the people closest to you is how you'll survive and how you'll protect them if anything ever goes wrong.  Guys, hurry up.  You're gonna be late for school.  I'm headed to the store.  Is there anything else you want for your party? Balloons aren't much of a list.  It's okay.  It don't need that other stuff.  It's too expensive.  How about you let me worry about that stuff, okay? It's your party.  You can have whatever you want.    Hello?   Hey, babe, it's me.  Go wait in the car.  What's wrong with mom? She only gets that way when she's talking to dad.  Hi.  I was able to track down that name Mariel with the number that you called in.  She's a Cuban refugee.  She's staying with cousins.  I had a cop bring her in.  Why scratch the number in the floor? Next of kin, in case something happened to her.  Guys like Castillo are ruthless.  They prey on families.  He was holding Mariel and six others captive at a salvage yard.  That explains the garage.  And if the relatives don't pay the release fee, the coyote would dump their ass overboard.  Cocksuckers make me sick.  Come on.  Mariel, estos son mis amigos que yo te dije.  Sargento Doakes y la detective Morgan.  Puede sentar.  Mariel, when was the last time you saw Jorge Castillo? \u00bfCu\u00e1ndo fue la ultima vez que t\u00fa viste a Jorge Castillo? Cuando me encerr\u00f3 con los otros despu\u00e9s de bajarnos del barco.  When he locked her and the other refugees up after pulling them from the boat.  No ten\u00edamos comida ni agua.  Un hombre trat\u00f3 de escapar.  Jorge lo agarr\u00f3 y lo golpe\u00f3.  They went without food and water.  Some guy tried to escape, but he was beaten by Jorge.    How'd she get free?   \u00bfC\u00f3mo escap\u00f3? Alguien abri\u00f3 la puerta al garaje.  Y nos escapamos.  Somebody opened the door to the garage.  Cuando los agarren, espero que los hagan sufrir mucho, especialmente esa concha que nos trat\u00f3 como perro.  She said, \"when we find them, to make them suffer for what they did, especially that concha that treated her like a dog.  Concha? Ah, got you.  Fuck me.  The wife was in on it.  Ask if she knows the little boy social services picked up.  \u00bfY qui\u00e9n era el ni\u00f1o peque\u00f1o que estaba con usted? \u00bfQu\u00e9 ni\u00f1o? Yo nunca vi un ni\u00f1o.  She never saw a boy.  No hair, no fibers, C. O. D.  exsanguination   So far, so good.    You're hovering.    Keep reading.    What am I looking for?   Wait for it.  This is a prelim.  I don't have time   \"M\" fucking 99.  Etorphine hydrochloride? An animal tranquilizer more powerful than morphine.  It causes total paralysis.  That mark on her neck kept bugging me, so I ordered up a tox screen.  That's it.  No more doughnuts for Masuka.  Dude, this stuff is strictly controlled.  The only way to get it is with a D. E. A.  license.  I put a request in for the list.  I should have it for Doakes in the morning.  Nice.  Yeah, baby.  I'm on that list, and eventually the alias I used will lead them back to me.  Ticktock.    Hey, you.    Thank god you're there.  I really need to talk with someone.  Everything okay?   Paul called after you left.    Paul? Who's Paul? My soon to be ex.  He's already out of jail   Overcrowding.  Can you believe it? Every time something goes just a little bit right, something like this happens.  He wants to come to Astor's party.    What did you tell him?   I'd have to think about it.  But even if I say \"no\", he won't listen.  He never does.  Can you   Can you come over tonight? I don't know, I'm kind of under the gun here, big case.  I shouldn't be dumping all this on you.  I'm sorry.  No, don't be.  Tell you what, I'll stop by if I can.  I promise.  Okay.  I'll keep a plate warm just in case.  Thanks.  Bye.  Check the marinas.  Find Jorge Castillo's boat.  We'll search the house.  Where's Laguerta? Trying to bring that kid in for a sketch.  Sketch? He told social services that some guy saved him from the bad lady.  Valerie Castillo? It sounds like she got exactly what she had coming to her.  Personally, I'd shake this guy's hand.  Yeah, you say that now.  Found his passport.  God I feel like I need a shower just looking at this douche bag.  Well, keep searching.  Phone records, bank accounts, credit cards.  Maybe the wife got greedy, and that's why he killed her.  Maybe.  This morning at the salvage yard, what was that thing by the car? What thing? Before you opened the trunk, you tried to cockblock me.  I was just looking out for my team.  I didn't see you looking out for Laguerta.    I would if she'd asked.    I didn't ask.  Fine.  Next time, just get your ass shot.    It's possible our guy left town.    If he even did it.    What if we have a copycat killer?   That's a bit of a stretch, don't you think? Just hear me out.  What if the person who killed Valerie Castillo was trying to bleed her out like the ice truck killer but didn't know how? She wasn't a hooker.  But she was killed someplace else, dumped and laid out in a ritualistic manner, just like all the others.  Except she wasn't in pieces.  But she had cuts on her neck.  I'm just saying, with all the media coverage on the ice truck killer, it's possible.  What do you suggest, Morgan? Let me work up a profile, just in case Jorge doesn't pan out.  Fine.  Whatever.  That's the second time you've made that face.  Who are you avoiding? We got one more stop to make.  Nothing lasts forever.  Just ask a Ford Pinto.  Eventually, most serial killers get caught.  There's really not much of a retirement plan.  But it can't end like this.  It's too soon.  I'm not ready.  He saw me.  What's this? You've been asking who's been calling.  My mom lives here.  Did you forget your laundry? She's been on me to stop by for dinner.  So I'm stoppin' by.  And here's the plan.  We go in.  We eat.  We out before the cheesecake.  You got it? I'm, what, your exit strategy? Look, you can stay out here if you want.  That gives me a better excuse to leave earlier or you can come in and have some free food.  It's your call.  Shit! My sisters are here, too.  Fucking family reunion! So this john comes out of nowhere.  He's got me by the throat.  I can't reach around and get my gun and I see he has a nipple ring.  I rip that fucker out like it's a grenade pin.  M organ! Oh, I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  Cop mouth.  We're used to it.  When James graces his family with this presence.  Some of us don't work at a bank.  Please, first words out of my baby brother's mouth were, \"Got milk, motherfucker\".  Oh, okay, now, that's enough, all of you.  That security guard on the news is gonna be all right? If someone did a hatchet job on me like that, I'd cash it all in.  Yeah, Tony's doing okay.  The hospital's setting him up with some prosthetics.  I don't know, he's just got this spirit about him.  The guy's missing body parts because of this ice truck killer asshole, and he's still hitting on me.  That's because men only think with one body part, and that one was not cut off.  Ma! Well, it's the damn truth.  Morgan, come on.  We got a case to solve.  Oh, are you sure, honey? I got some cheesecake in the fridge.  Yeah.  We're sure.  You know I would love some cheesecake bit.  You can wait in the car.  That's your call.  He'll wait.    I'll do the dishes.    I'll help you.  Ooh, I'm sorry.  I wonder, in time, if they'll even remember me, other than the man who broke their mother's heart.  I'll be breaking their hearts, too.  He is their father.  They have a right to know he's been released, right? Yeah, sure.  Yeah.  Even if I tell Paul not to come, he'll show up here eventually.  I know him.  Everything's been going so good at work With you.  I don't know what to do.  He's really got a hold on you, doesn't he? Paul always had a temper, but when he was using He said if I left, he would find us and hurt the kids.  Somehow, I thought that by staying, I was protecting them.  Cody doesn't remember the worst of it, but Astor She was the one who called the police the last time.  She was protecting me.  You're not that woman anymore.  You're stronger than that now.  If their dad shows up, we'll deal with it together.  Dad's coming home? Can he sleep in my room, mom? Can he, mom? I shouldn't even be here.  Rita will be devastated if I'm arrested.  Her husband was a crackhead, her boyfriend's a serial killer.  It's kind of hard not to take that personally.  Better get inside, son.  Storm's on its way.  Why didn't you tell me what you are, Dex? Any last words? Figures.  I don't have bad dreams.  When I sleep, all of me sleeps.  Nothing ever goes bump in Dexter's night.  I've never felt a moment of remorse, doubt, regret.  What's happening to me? If my back wasn't against the wall, I'd almost feel guilty for hacking into Masuka's e mail.  Once I got past all the porn, it was easy.  And there I am.  Dr.  Patrick Bateman   So wholesome, so inconspicuous.  Harry would frown upon destroying evidence, but he never wanted me to get caught, either.  What are you doing in here? My computer went down.  I was just checking some e mail.  Can you take a look at this for me? Copycat killer? I worked all night on that profile.  I'd like to give it to Laguerta, but I want to make sure it's good enough.  I'm honored.  \"The similar manner in which the victim's body was displayed suggests this killer \"feels a connection to the ice truck killer, \"excited by what he's doing.  \"The cut on the victim's cheek, while not fatal, \"appears to be a signature of sorts.  \"Because of the lack of evidence collected from the crime scene, \"the suspect may be familiar \"with law enforcement or forensics procedure.  \" Why'd you quit? You're getting to the good stuff.  Let me guess   Single white male, mid 30s, lives alone, disconnected from his emotions.  It's a little textbook, don't you think? But it totally fits this case.  You're trying to make it fit.  My advice? Keep this to yourself.  Really? Deb, you're new to Homicide.  This blows up in your face, you've given Laguerta the excuse she's been looking for to send you back to Vice.  No.  I'm on to something here.  I feel it.  Like one of your hunches.  Way to have my back.  Where's your sister? Debra! What the hell do you think you're doing? How did you get into my cabinet? You hide the key in the pantry on the top shelf.  You and your brother know never to touch my guns unless it's under my direct supervision.  But I was being really careful! I mean, I was only shooting at the cans and the bottles.  And I'm really good, like Dexter, and now we can all go hunting together.  I'm disappointed in you, Debra.  Grab your things.  Thanks a lot.  Starting this morning, we have cadets from the academy going over every inch of the salvage yard.  Those days I don't miss.  The kid we found yesterday saw someone abduct Valerie Castillo from that yard.  Because he didn't recognize a photo of Jorge Castillo, Lieutenant Laguerta is bringing him in to attempt a sketch.  Come on, sweetheart.  Let's take the seatbelt off.  There you go.  Come on.  Come on, sweetheart.  You want to go inside to see the nice lady? Come on, sweetie.  Let's go.  Thanks for bringing him by.  Hola, Oscar.  \u00bfT\u00fa quieres venir conmigo? Normally, I wouldn't approve of something like this, but you've made quite an impression.  You have kids? No.  I was like him once   A stranger in a strange place, left to grow up with strangers, all for a better life.  Well, police lieutenant   I'd say you've done okay.    Any luck with the family?   No.  He talks about an Uncle Roberto.  He just uses the first name.  Maybe we'll have some luck on our end.  I hope so.  I hate to send another one of these kids into foster care.  Thank you.  Bye, sweetheart.  Meanwhile, we'll follow up on the D. E. A.  list of M 99 buyers.  That would include vets, doctors, animal control, even circuses.  Be thorough.  Check everyone.  Masuka, what do we have on the home and the boat? Still processing, sir.  If it turns up the husband is a dead end, then we're looking at a new suspect, folks.  Morgan.  Any ideas? Don't do it, Deb.  The last thing I need right now is to be profiled for all of Miami metro.  We could be looking at someone who's inspired by the ice truck killer.  A copycat.  If so, the suspect is probably familiar with forensic procedures.  I have a profile.  I'd be happy to show it to you.  I'll be in my lab.  Hello, Dex.  Oscar \u00bfEl hombre que viste era como yo o m\u00e1s delgado? Mi hijito, est\u00e1 bien.  Cu\u00e9ntanos.  Cu\u00e9ntanos lo que t\u00fa viste esa noche.    I'll be right back.    No! Est\u00e1 bien, me quedo aqu\u00ed.  I forgot how much I loved pastelitos growing up.  He just needed a little reminder of home.  I was barely his age when I came over with my family.  I threw up the whole damn way.  \u00bfQuieres m\u00e1s? \u00bfCinco? Go get the artist.  I think somebody's ready.  Save me some.  No, dice que no.  Cinco no puede.  Pero tres, s\u00ed.    No es 5, es 10.    \u00bf10? Te digo que t\u00fa hablas con el se\u00f1or cuando el venga, y entonces, s\u00ed, yo te doy 10, lo que t\u00fa quieras.  20.    50?   50.  Did you thank Mrs.  Carrol for picking you up from school for me? Yes.  So, what do you think? Everything okay? You want to talk out it? Holly, Blake, and Ashley said they can't come to my party.  Honey, that's not true.  I spoke with their moms last week.  It's all Cody's fault.  He couldn't keep his mouth shut about dad getting out of jail.    Did not!   You told everyone! I have to know.  Dexter Thank god.  My arm's asleep.  How long have you two been like this? Half an hour.  I was afraid I'd wake him if I moved.  At that age, when they're out, they're out.  You could brush his teeth, and he wouldn't wake up.  Here.  Lift up his head.  I'll slide this underneath.  Oh, thanks.  What are you doing here? I'm waiting on some lab work.  I had some time to kill.  Go ahead.  We didn't get very far.  He's so tired.  We're gonna pick it up again tomorrow.  It's only a matter of time before we know what this little guy saw.  If you, um here.  You want help or not? I have a hair or something stuck on my lens.  Luckily, you're in good hands.  I traded my glasses in for contacts in high school.  Boys? Yeah.  What I really needed was tits.  I had Winnie the Poohs on my bras until I was 16.  As you can see,   not a whole lot's changed since then.    Morgan.  Try not to blink, okay? Okay, okay.  I'll do it.  I'll do it.  Let me ask you something.  Your brother's adopted, right? Yeah, my dad found him at a crime scene.  How did the department feel about Harry getting personally involved in a case? It didn't seem to be a problem.  My parents never talked about it much.  Oh, but still, raising a boy, it's a lot of work, no? Dex? God, no.  I got in more trouble than he did.  He was the perfect one.  Here, I think I see it.  There's the bastard.  Thanks.  Let me ask you a question.  Why do you have it in for me? You're loud, you're impulsive, and you constantly question authority.  Fair enough.  I hear you have an interesting theory on   Honey, what is it? Sweetie.  I'm sorry.  It was an accident.  It's all right.  These things happen.  Go get changed, and I'll fix the bed.  Mommy? Is it okay if I didn't have my party? It's only a matter of time before that boy finishes telling the police who he saw that night at the salvage yard   Me.  Once the sketch is finished, there will be no place left to hide.  If I want any chance of survival, I have to get rid of it all.  I have to let go.  Alex Timmons   Sniper.  Yes, I did it.  Is that what you want to hear? Gene Marshall   Arsonist.  Have you ever watched someone burned alive? Cindy Landon   Black widow.  I'll fuck you if you let me go.  Such fond memories of them all.  They all accepted their fate in their own way.  Now it's time for me to do the same.  Valerie Castillo   My last victim.  He's not angry.  That's not what this is about.  He's testing me.  I was wrong the whole time.  My playmate saw an opportunity to paint me into a corner to see if I'd find my way out, if I'd fight to survive.  If you have a well preserved sample, transferring a dry drop of blood is relatively easy, almost as easy as it was lifting Jorge Castillo's fingerprints from his boat and putting them on this knife.  Just got off the phone with the FBI.  Now for the hard part.  I wanted to see what their computers would spit out.  I cross referenced my profile with the ice truck killer list.  How about we hold off till we get a sketch, take it from there.  I know, I know.  I want to get a head start on this.  We could look these over at lunch   My treat.  You never give up, do you? Thank your mom for dinner the other night.  Can't remember the last time I met a guy's family and they actually liked me.  You held your own.  Most people don't get a dirty word in edgewise with my sisters around the table.  In our house, every Thursday night was pancake night   A Morgan tradition.  I miss that kind of stuff, you know? I found something.  The wife's blood? You're sure? This was found in the Castillo's bedroom hamper.  We check all the clothing items that come in.  Sometimes because of sheer volume, that takes time.  It doesn't prove anything.  Not by itself but I've been re examining the video footage I took from that morning.  Notice the cuts along the carotid arteries.  They're long, deep.  Valerie Castillo bled to death in minutes.  No shit.  The person who did this wasn't trying to emulate the ice truck killer.  He was in a hurry.  He was probably afraid of getting caught.  Most killers are.  Except if this was a copycat, he wouldn't be in a rush.  He would savor his first kill.  He would control the precise moment Valerie Castillo died instead of just letting her bleed out.  This is all too passive.  Have you completely ruled out the husband? Why are you doing this? The boy said he didn't recognize Jorge Castillo in any of the photos.  Well, he was a dehydrated and traumatized 7 year old left to fend for himself for days in a salvage yard.  You really think it's the husband? He's a deep sea fisherman.  Most know how to use a knife.  Plus, he's still missing.  Have you finished your search of the salvage yard? I'll have them send the cadets out again.  Hey, I'm sorry.  I know how hard you worked on that profile.  No, Dex, I really don't think you do.  How long are you grounded for? Two months.  Deb, I had to tell him.  No, Dex, you didn't.  You could have kept your fucking mouth shut.  Dad was worried about you, and so was I.  Well, now you can spend more time together.  I'm not stupid, Dexter.  That's always what you wanted.  No, it's not.  Deb, you're my sister.  No, I am not.  And he is my father! There are so many times, I swear, Dexter, I wish he wouldn't have brought you home! Dexter, I am so sorry.  I really really didn't mean it like that.  Here.  I thought you might want that.  You're a better shot than me anyway.    Hello?   Paul, hey, it's me.    Look, we need to talk.    Sure thing.  I know you want to see Astor, but, I mean, the kids are doing so well now.  Maybe   Maybe it would be a good idea if you don't come to the party.    I just want   She is my daughter, too, Rita.  I have every right to be there.  You know what? I'm sorry.  I'm sorry, but I have full custody now, and you can't just drop in on us like this anymore.  Now, I checked and the restraining order is still in effect.  So if you step one foot on this property, the first call I'm gonna make is to the police.  The second call is to your parole officer.  I need the sergeant.  Morgan.  I'll be right there.  Est\u00e1 listo.  Ya lo tir\u00e9.  Oscarsito.  It\u00edo Roberto! The uncle called our office this morning.  He lives in Tampa.  That's great.  He should be with family.  Can I take him home? We're good.  Thank you.  Thank you for finding him, huh? He's a very special boy.  I know.  Cu\u00eddate? L. T. , you need to see this.    You okay?   These contacts.  Dios m\u00edo.  Wrecks like this are usually sold for scrap.  The husband stashes a knife inside and lets a demo crew shred the truck before we find it.  No more murder weapon.  There's blood.  Want to bet it's the wife's? It's always the husband.  You were right all along.  Shake it off, Morgan.  Homicide takes time.  Deb will forgive me eventually.  That's who she is   Bighearted, kind.  Nothing like me.    Laguerta thought you should see this.    What you got? That kid Oscar swears this is who he saw.    Son of a bitch.    Dex.  Okay, I gave them Jorge's sock, a knife with his prints, and a drop of his wife's blood.  Forensics trifecta like that should trump a child's drawing I hope.    Too fucking weird.    Jesus Christ saved this kid? On his own for as long as Oscar was, who's to say he didn't? When did lighting candles become more fun than blowing them out? Nice turnout.  I called all the moms to assure them that Paul would not be making an appearance.  Do Astor and Cody know that you told their dad not to come? After presents.  Ready? Make a wish, baby.  Just don't tell anybody, or it won't come true.  It already came true.  Dad's not here.    I want the middle piece.    Okay.  I was wrong about birthdays.  Maybe the reason to celebrate them is what they offer   The hope of living to see another one.  The thing about Deb forgiving me   I better give her a few more days.  I barely escaped getting caught this time.  I realize now my days are numbered.  So I better make the most of them.  All along, I thought this was a game my alter ego and I were playing.  But relationships change, evolve, and this one's getting deep.  Like Harry said in my dream the storm's on its way.      Previous EpisodeNext Episode"

        "script": "Previously on \"Dexter\" It is my new friend.  When he broke into my apartment, he took some time to get to know me   My life.  My secrets.  Same as the others   No blood.  Somebody who was here last night saw something.  They got a night watchman, but we can't find him.  It's the guard   Tucci.  I think he's alive.  Taking Tucci over to County.  Rudy here is gonna put me back together again.  Yo, pretty boy, you're stealing my thunder.  I don't know.  I just might have to fight you for this one.  How about you focus on whether or not he was the man you saw at the old hospital that night, Mr.  Perry? It was difficult to tell.  It was dark.  Florida prisons kick free I search for the ones who think they beat the system, like Jeremy Downs.  Jeremy got off easy.  To the coroner, the knife strokes looked random, but I saw the work of a young virtuoso.  Are you gonna fuck me, faggot? 'Cause I killed the last guy who raped me.  I understand now.  Jeremy didn't murder that boy four years ago.  He was taking out the garbage.  Wait, is that all? The FBI estimates that there are less than 50 serial killers active in the United States today.  We don't get together at conventions, share trade secrets, or exchange Christmas cards But sometimes I wonder what it's like for the others.  The only sound I hear, the only sound in the entire world is my heart beating.  I swear to Christ, Morgan, after this case, I'm submitting your ass for psychiatric evaluation.  I'm just retracing castoff patterns, directionality angles.  Can you tell us what happened here or not?   It's an execution.    Pretty unlikely victim.  The kid's an honor student, editor of his school yearbook.  It's all in the knife work.  It's skillful, no wasted motion.  The killer had experience.  Every stroke hit a major artery Or at least came close.  Are you getting a goddamn hard on there, Morgan? It's trully horrific.  He was yearbook committee, you said? I want your report on this tomorrow.  I wish I could say Sergeant Doakes is my biggest problem right now, but he's not.  I've seen these wounds before.  You're drooling on Laguerta's couch.    You pulling a midnight shift?   Lopez has the trots.    Why are you still here?   Why not? Nothing at home except an empty fridge and an empty bed.  If I wasn't married and 10 years younger I'd still be in high school.  Keep dreaming.  Wiseass.  I've been chasing leads on the ice truck killer.  Pathetic long shots, mostly.  Yeah? What kind of leads? I looked at the research.  With mass murderers, it's dumb shit that trips them up.  Son of Sam got a parking ticket outside his own crime scene.  So you ran parking violations at the crime scenes of our guy? Smart.  Yeah, but none of the registered owners had criminal records.  Try \"moving violations.  \" Timothy McVeigh drove way too fast on the way out of town.  Neil Perry   I know that name.  Yeah, he came forward as a witness two weeks ago when pieces of Tony Tucci were showing up around town.  He rode through a stop sign two blocks from the third crime scene at the Seven Seas motel.  Why would a voluntary witness be at two separate crime scenes? I don't know.  Maybe he was chopping up hookers.    Holy mother of fuck, is this him?   Let's find out.  Are you sure this is the right address? According to DMV, this is where Perry lives.  With his seven inbred cousins, by the look of it.  Something has got to be wrong with somebody that can live in a steel box.  Aluminum, actually.  Nina and I had a deluxe multisectional.    For real?   It was our starter home.  This is our car.  One of the victims was seen getting in a wood paneled station wagon on the night of her death.  Let's take one step at a time.  Let's find our guy.  According to his files, he works as a computer analyst for Miami Lake.  Look up slowly.  All right, take the front door.  Cover all the exits.  I'm going to the back.  Open up, Perry! It's the police! Open up, Perry! Police! Open up, Perry! Open the door! Hey, Angel, I got him! Police! Stop running, Perry! Get the fuck down! Fuck! I knew I recognized the knife work of the killer.  Jeremy Downs.  I had him.  He was mine Until I found out the boy Jeremy killed raped him He fucked me and I killed him.  So I let Jeremy go.  It seemed fair.  But my random act of kindness was misguided.  If I had followed my instincts, this boy's high school yearbook would still have an editor.  Captain Matthews is coordinating the FDLE to launch a statewide manhunt The task force will tear apart the house for any evidence that links Neil Perry to the ice truck murders.  We need proof this time, people   Tangible proof.  What is it? They really found the ice truck killer? I did.  Yes, yes.  We will financially guarantee extradition from anywhere.  James? Yeah, I'm on it, lieutenant.  I'll run the task force.  Actually, I need you and Pullman to stay with the knife victim in the alley.    His parents are high profile.    Whatever you need.  Angel You found Perry.  You run the task force.  Contact the fugitive's friends, family, co workers, coke dealer   Anybody who might try to hide him.  You want us to circulate his photo? In neighborhoods only.  Keep it away from the media.  This case stays low profile.  The last thing I need is another Tony Tucci on my hands.    Anything else, lieutenant?   Yes   Choose task force members who can put their regular duties aside and bust ass until Neil Perry's apprehended.    OK.    OK.    Dominic.  Okay, that's all.  Thank you.    Do you really think this is the guy?   It's all lining up.  I saw him, Dex.  I chased him.  Debra Morgan.  Get over here.  You're on the team.  Do you hear that? I'm on the team.  Do you think we get hats? Hardly looks a guy capable of terrorizing Miami.  A science camp, maybe.  I'm off.  I'll keep you in the loop.  Where's my blood report, Sparky? I'm on it, sergeant.    How you doing, Mrs.  Bennett?   Hey, Charlie.  Where are the kids? Your husband swung by a few minutes ago.  He didn't tell you? I never seen Cody light up like that before.  Big treat   The old man coming down.  Wait, wait.  Wait.    Paul?   Yeah.  He just picked up the kids.  You gave my children to Paul? Are you stupid? I told the administrative office that Cody and Astor are not to be released into his custody! Well, nobody told me.  He just got out of fucking jail! Everyone, follow strict, sterile protocol.  There will be no contamination of my crime scene.  Bag anything that could be used to murder or dispose of a human body.  That's pretty much everything in here, boss.  Except this.  Can you say \"sick fuck\"? Some might say that.  To others, crypto taxidermy is a fine art.  I got a mummified chupacabra at home.  Can I have permission to run Masuka's prints   as the ice truck killer?   No need for that.  I'll give you some warm DNA right now.  God, you're gross.  I didn't hear that.  Detective, I found something.  An archive of hidden files.  A lot of how to documents   Draining blood from cattle, wartime amputation techniques.  \"Butchering the human carcass\"? There's even an article about countries that don't extradite to the U. S.  We got this fucker.  We got jack shit, Morgan.  Everything in here is circumstantial.  We need some hard evidence.  I'm not done looking yet.  Are you? The school had no right to release my children to Paul.    No, they didn't.    He lost his custody rights right around the time my head hit the living room wall.  I would think so.  I should be out looking for my kids.  Rita, the best thing you could do for the kids is stay here in case he calls.  What if he doesn't? What if he kidnapped them to get back at me for putting him in jail? Dexter, I     Hi.    I got you.  Astor! Mom, look   It's dad.  He came home.  Yeah.  What, you think I was gonna move to the moon? Stop it.  Just stop.  Do you know I called the police? Why? I told you I was taking them to the carnival.    No, you didn't.    Rita, I called you at the hotel.  They said you were on a break, so I left a message with the info and my cell number.  Uh, hi.  How are you? I'm Paul Bennett, father on parole.  Uh, Dexter Morgan.  Uh, I can't think of anything clever to say.  Paul, this is unacceptable.  I have custody.  You can't just take them without my permission.  I came to see my babies.  I missed them, Rita.  I missed a lot of things.  I should phone the station, call off the dogs.  Dexter, look   My dad's home.  Yeah, I see that, buddy.  Hey, Angel.  You're the expert on manufactured living.  This closet look a little small to you? A little.  Sweet.  I've got newspaper articles.  \"Dismembered body found in a pool.  \" \"Ice truck killer appalls Miami.  \" This is a record of everything he's ever done.  I got photos.  Those of his crimes.  Did we release those photos to the press?   No.    Did he take them himself? He had to.    Did we just hit the mother lode?   No.  We hit the motherfucking mother lode.  The evidence just keeps piling up at the mobile home.  I just authorized an excavation of the back patio.  I think there's something buried there.  What are we doing to find Neil Perry? I put his name in the automated system and notified the FBI.  Airports on alert? Airports, train stations, bus lines.  We should track his credit cards.  Already done, along with A. T. M. s and bank accounts.  I also put a tap on his home phone.    Seems you thought of everything.    It seems that way.    Look, Maria     No need to apologize.  I don't require your approval to do my job.  I know that.  I've been kicking your ass 'cause I knew you had this in you.  Well, thank you for making me the woman I am today.  I love you to everything.  I love you to everything, too.  He's not gonna hit you anymore.  He told me at the carnival.  I made him promise.  Thank you, baby.  I haven't had time to process as much as the kids.  And Paul was supposed to be locked up for another year.  Cody seems to be processing okay.  Cody's too young.  A dad's just a concept to him, not a person.  But Astor   She remembers what he put us through.  Well, at least you're not married anymore.  That's just it.  Technically, we are.  When Paul went to prison, I started divorce proceedings, but he refused to sign the paperwork.  As a power play? I don't think so.  I think for all the darkness that haunts him, Paul loves having a family.  I think he's just afraid to let go.  When did you first notice it? This darkness inside the guy you fell for.  I always knew it was there.  I guess I just didn't think I deserved better Till I met you.  I have a dark side, too.  What? I do.  Somehow I doubt that.  You have a good heart, Dexter.  You're not like Paul.  You don't hurt people.  Innocent people.  I don't hurt innocent people.  Hey, dude, the bowling alley's around the corner.  Hey, I'm looking for Jeremy Downs.  Jeremy? He vacated the premises.  Focus.  I'm trying to find Jeremy.  Oh, I get it.  Look, man, I'm not really into that homo shit, but I'm kind of short on money for weed, so I guess I'll do it for less than Jeremy's charging.  Wait.  What does Jeremy charge? Jeremy's selling himself? I mean, he's always hanging out with the Brokeback boys down at Flamingo Park.  Comes back with fistfuls of cash.  It's me.  Get your ass over to Neil Perry's place.    You're gonna want to see this.    Deb, it's my day off.  Just get your ass over here.  We're about to bust open the goods on the ice truck killer.  Not what I expected.  So lifelike.  Hey, Dex.  I thought you'd want to be here.  Something's buried down there.  Masuka's been digging all night.  I hate to break this to you, Deb, but you know you've got the wrong guy here, right? The ice truck killer drains the blood from his victims, freezes their bodies, and only then severs their limbs.  It's clean and efficient   His psychological signature.  Neil Perry, on the other hand, stuffs roadkill.  Yeah, and turns it into fucked up fantasy shit.  But the fantasies are all wrong! The guy we're looking for wouldn't turn dead, dirty things into living cartoons.    He'd find that pathetic.    How do you know? Because it is pathetic.  Deb, trust me.  Neil Perry is not a killer.  He's a dabbler.  He's a waste of time.  If the guy we're looking for took his early fantasies out on animals, he'd bury them, not display them.  And what about an early human kill? Would he bury that, too?   Sure.  Probably.    Then turn around.  You were saying? It looks like an adult female.  Any idea how long the body's been down there? Based on decomposition, she's been tits up for two, maybe three years.  We'll know more after the autopsy.  What happened to the limbs? Did they rot off? No.  They're clean cuts.  But he didn't chop up the whole body.  This could be Perry's first kill, like he was experimenting.  You're the expert, Dex.  What do you think? Sure.  Sounds good.  Actually, it sounds perfectly awful.  For weeks, I've felt like a student in a master class.  Is it really possible that the master's on the run? And even more tragic, does he live in a double wide? The gravitron goes so fast, mom.  My dad took me on it three times.  Wow.  Is that so? All right, let me cut you guys up some fruit.  Astor wouldn't go.  She was afraid.  So what? I don't like fast rides.  Hello?   Who wants doughnuts?   I do.  Paul, you can't just walk in here whenever you want.  You don't live here anymore.  Sorry about that.  Old habits.  I'll ring the doorbell next time.  I got these for you.  All right.  I'll just put them in something.  Dad, can I have a doughnut? You got it, buddy.  Coming up.  What, now you're making me out to be the bad guy? They haven't had breakfast yet! You know what? Kidlet, my bad.  Sorry about that.  These doughnuts are for after school.  But tell what? I could whip up some eggs and pancakes.    Paul!   Very little syrup, I promise.  And meat.  You into meat? I like meat.  I like meat on my feet.  It's real squishy.  Paul.  You can't do this anymore, Paul.  What?! What?! Help raise my kids?! Yes, I can.  That's my job.  All right, look.  I can't even begin to understand how difficult this has been for you, Rita, being a single mom, okay? And for that, I I'm eternally sorry.  I let you down.  I let everybody down.  But if I could just find that frying pan.  Astor Want to help me find the frying pan? We got a profile of Neil Perry.  He's a computer expert.  I. Q.  off the chart.  He's a loner, no pryors.  His father split when he was 6.  His mother was an alcoholic, abusive, and possibly his first victim.  Roberta Perry.  Dental records say she was the one under the patio.  Now, Neil kept her death quiet by cashing her social security checks for the last two years but, he did not kill her for the money.  Morgan? We think he wanted release.  Roberta Perry ran her son's life, controlled him, beat him as a kid.  We think he dreamt about killing her for years.  I just spoke with Perry's cellphone provider.  Can they track his location? No signal   He probably turned off his phone.  But, according to records, he used it on some of the nights the ice truck killer victims were taken.  Who did he call? Voice mail, mostly, checking messages.  Verizon triangulated the location.  All the calls came from the same place   a six block area on southwest 8th street.  The Tamiami Trail.  That strip's full of No Tell motels.  It's like a happy hunting ground for hookers.  There's a good chance that's where he's killing his victims.  Let's recanvass the area for leads.  Now that we've got a photo of this guy, maybe we can find somebody who actually saw him.  Let's go.  You're starting to look like her.  Want to stop by your house, check in with your family? I'd rather check in with your brother.  His instincts are usually pretty good on this stuff.  Yeah, not today.  He'd just piss on our parade.  He needs his day off.  The first time I saw his work, I felt like a Spanish explorer landing of the shores of the New World.  No blood in the victims, no spatter, no stain.  Deb is wrong about him.  It's okay.  Hell, I've made mistakes.  In fact, I'm about to correct a big one right now.  Jeremy Downs.  Hey, you want company? Just keep walking and looking ahead.  Some mangroves over by the lake, we can go in there.  It's too public.  My car's in the parking lot.    Are your windows tinted?   I said, \"eyes front.  \" What's wrong? Shit.  Shit! Get the fuck out of my way! Take it easy, Jeremy! Stay right there! Take him down! Take him down! Hands behind your back.  Stand up! Stand up! Miami Metro P. D.  Can we have a minute? Yeah.    This guy look familiar?   I don't know.  They come.  They go.  You get it? They \"come.  \" Look, my feet are aching from pounding the pavement.  You think you could help us out? What's your name? Laline Consuelo Garci\u00e1 G\u00f3mez.  Laline O\u00edste del hombre que le dicen el ice truck killer? S\u00ed.  Puede ser el.  So let's try this again.  Have you seen this man? He's a regular.  Rents a room by the month   Cash.  When was the last time he was here? He's here now.  He brought a girl to his room this morning.  A working girl? A hooker?   All his guests are hoo   What's the room number? Here's the master.  Call for backup.  Let's hope this girl is still alive.  Do we wait for tactical? Not with a possible victim in there.  Clear.  It's okay.  We're here now.  You're safe.  Please get me out   Hurry   Before he comes back!   Where is he?   Please, I want to get out! Where was he going? The liquor store.  He said he's coming right back.  What? Hey, where's Doakes? He paged me.  We need your report from that kid in the alley.  But it's my day off! I was just at Don Shula's famous golf course! Did you finish your report or not? Yeah, it's in my lab.  Wait.  I'm on to you.  Excuse me? Your crazy ass, knife slashing two step in the alley.  You were right.  You said the killer had previous experience.  He did.  Really? Masuka lifted a print from the alley that matched a kid from juvie.  Cut up a victim five years ago.  Same knife technique.  We just grabbed him at Flamingo Park.    Great work, sergeant.    Yeah.  Your instincts were dead on.  They're always dead on when it comes to killers.  Why is that? I'll just go get that report.  I'm watching you.  Miss me? Police.  On the ground.  Get down slowly.  \"Now the day is over \"Night is drawing nigh\" Get down! \"The shadows of the evening \"steal across the sky\" I said get the fuck down! \"Now the darkness gathers\" Facedown   Let's go! \"Stars begin to peep \"Birds and beasts and flowers \"soon will be asleep\".  We will him secure.  What else do you want to put in the concoction? Gummi bears.  How do you two plan to eat that, spread it on toast? It already has toast in it.  So it does.  Keep mashing.  I'll get the door.  Hey, there, big guy.  Dexter, right? Paul, hi.  Rita's not here.  Oh, that's okay.  I'm actually here for the kids.  I came to dazzle them with my booty.  This booty.  This is awkward.  I'm afraid I'm not comfortable letting you inside the house without Rita here.  Who are you, anyway, like, the babysitter? I'm watching the kids right now, so I suppose that makes me the babysitter.  Are you fucking my wife? I'll let Rita know you stopped by.  Or I could just walk in.  My house.  I own this place.  I bet she didn't tell you that, did she? Homeowner issues are way over my head.  I should probably just call the police, let them sort this out.  Is that it? Yeah.  Yeah, why don't you give those presents to my little buckets of sunshine, tell Rita she can reach me at the Motor Court? Okay.  He might be a crack addled, wife abusing yahoo, but he refuses to abandon his kids.  I'm not sure that's a good thing.  Take him on in.  I'll be right there.  You got it.  Congratulations.  You just brought down the most notorious serial killer in Florida history.  Fucking \"A. \" He's in booking right now.  It sucks you weren't a part of this.  I mean, you and me, we paved the way for this, right? I'm cool.  I've got my own bad guy.  Listen, I just picked up a message from Tony Tucci.  Our favorite fun loving amputee's getting out of the hospital.    There's a party tonight.    No, thanks.  But I don't want to go, either.  The guy lost body parts, and we get to tell him we caught the guy.    Come on, what else you got going on?   Wouldn't you like to know? There will be hookers there.  All right.  Fine, Mr.  Grumpy Head.  Have it your way.  Did he threaten you? No.  Nothing like that.  He was just marking his territory.  Fucking bastard! Only you could make those words cute.  Stop it.  Paul said he owns this house.  Is that true? Yeah.  Yeah.  He had it before we met.  I think he got it in a drug trade.  Dex, what am I gonna do? I'd start by getting a divorce.  God, this is such a mess, and I've dragged you into it.  There, there.  I just wish   I just wish he'd go away.  Why can't he just go away and disappear forever? He can do that   Very easily.  Oh, shit.  Fuck.  We   we need to talk.  Yeah.  Just let me grab my heart up off the fucking floor.  Holy fuck, Rita.  Come on in.  No! No, I'm good right here.  Aw, come on.  Don't be that way.  Come on in.  I got a six pack chilling in the cooler.  No.  No more.  What? No more surprise visits to the house, no more intimidating my friends, and especially no more Disney dad.  You lost your right to be a father when you beat your children's mother.  You want to get to know Astor and Cody, you're gonna have to work for that privilege.  Whoa, whoa, babe, can I get a word in here? No.  Divorce papers.  They're the ones you refused to sign in prison.  Sign them now, and I'll agree to supervised visits twice a week.  Show me you can do that for six months, and then maybe   maybe   I'll think about a nonsupervised schedule.  Is this some kind of joke, Rita? You think you can really make me back down? No, I don't.  But what else am I gonna do, Paul? A judge put me in control.  I'm in control now, and I have the power to make sure you never see your children again unless you do exactly as I tell you.  Goddamn, you are fine when you're mad.  I love the new you.  I do.  My ass is yours to kick.  I deserve it.  Here   Look.  Rita, I'm a changed man.  I swear to God, I am going to prove it to you.  All right.  There she is.  Anybody bring any popcorn? You got him.  Both of them.    Where's Perry's lawyer?   He waived the right.  I can't hear a thing.  Who's got the remote? There they are   My two colleagues technically speaking.  Thankfully, one of them's a fraud.  because you assume that.  So you can assume I killed them.  You can assume anything that you want.  The doer is merely a fiction that's added to the deed   The deed.  The deed is everything.  At least I hope he's a fraud.  Here's to my new hand.  Some say bravery is being the only one who knows you're afraid.  But I've worked with a lot of amputees, and I got to say I don't think Tony knew he was afraid.  Here's to one crazy bastard.  Kiss my atrophied ass.  Now for the main event.  Medical marijuana? You wish.  Can you, uh, help me out here, Rudy? Look at that shit.  Half human, half machine.  But all man, baby.  I got it.  Yeah.  May I have this dance? Hey, buddy, you might have a chance with me, after all.  Oh, don't worry.  There's still plenty enough of me to go around.  So, you made that hand and foot? Delicate thing.  Tony lost a piece of himself, and I helped him find it.  I mean, how often in life do you get to make someone whole? I wouldn't know.  It's like living art   what you do.  It's funny you should say that, because before I turned to prosthetics, I, uh, studied the human form at the university of Paris   Sorbonne.    Really?   Yeah.    Have you had dinner yet?   I would love to.  I thought I'd come and show my support.    Bad timing?   No.  No.  Have some champagne, sergeant.  See, we got blogs.  We got podcasts.  You know, the information won't stop.  It comes into your head and bleeds out your eyes, and it's all crap.  You know? See, you got to dare for greatness these days to get people's attention.  Did I get yours? This is worse than foreplay.  Why doesn't she ask him any questions? I have no idea what she's doing, but my patience is wearing thin.  I gave Jeremy a chance, and he blew it.  Is this one going to disappoint me, too? That's an interesting interview technique.  I'm tired of asking questions.  You're getting off on this too fucking much.    Getting off on what?   The game.  I'm guessing that's why you didn't request a lawyer   So you can sit here and say whatever shit comes into your head.  Meanwhile, my ass is spreading like Cheez Whiz, waiting for you to figure out this isn't the fun part.  What are you talking about? We got you dead to rights.  But the good times won't start rolling till you're in a courtroom with your own personal judge Ito and Court TV carrying your scary ass scowls and crazy shit live.  Fascination with serial killers is an American pastime.  You've got groupie housewives, magazine profiles, maybe even a summer blockbuster movie All waiting for you.  But the feeding frenzy won't start till you throw out the chum.  Until then, I'm just gonna chill.  You're right.  Yeah.  This isn't the fun part.  The fun part was hanging them like cattle.  Hanging who? The hookers Right before I cut their throats.  Son of a bitch.  I used gravity roots to hang them upside down to drain the blood.  Then That shit is privileged.  The press never got ahold of that.  I'd pour in liquid nitrogen to freeze the blood before I cut them into nice and clean pieces.  Yes.  See, you got to understand I   I hate blood.  And there it is   All the expectations I had, all the promises of greatness wiped out.  My circle of friends is down to one.  How   What are you doing here? Are you a cop? The cameras are off.  I have one minute.  Tell me why.  I need to know.    Why what?   Don't! You killed again.  I told you   I warned you   Don't kill anyone who doesn't deserve to die.  Why did you do it? To feel something different.  Different than what? What do you normally feel? Nothing.  Fucking nothing at all! I hate every fucking goddamn second of it.  I can't stand it   Living my life in my head.  Does killing make it better? No.  Worse.  Fucking worse than ever.  Put your hands on the table.  Do it.  I'm a lot like you, you know? Yeah, right.  You're a killer? I'm empty but I found a way to make it feel less bottomless.    How?   Pretend.  You pretend the feelings are there for the world, for the people around you.  Who knows? Maybe one day they will be.  What the hell are you doing, Morgan? I'm scraping under the nails for blood.  Almost done.  Get out.  I want 10 more minutes with this piece of shit before his lawyer shows.  Stand up! Living my life in my head   I know exactly what Jeremy means.  At least I had someone to talk to   Harry, my foster father.  He spent endless hours teaching me how to survive.  Excuse me.  Are you Jeremy Downs' lawyer? Yes, I am.  I'm just heading over to see him.  Sooner would be better.    Seriously.    Thank you.  My mom died when I was 16  Cancer   And then it was just me, my brother, my dad.    You have a brother?   Yeah.  Dexter.  He and my dad were really tight.  You know, they were always spending time together.  I guess I was jealous.  What, you mean you weren't daddy's little girl? No, I was kind of.  He just took a special interest in Dex, you know? I think that's why I became a cop.  That's what he was.  I thought maybe he would give me more attention or something.  And did he? Not really But we had our moments.  What about you? How'd you become Captain hook? Well, when I was little, my mom got in a car accident.  She lost both her legs.  It's terrible.  I remember when it happened, I just wanted to put her back together You know, like Humpty Dumpty.  Just the pieces weren't around.  I'm going to miss my playmate.  Sure, there's Rita and the kids, but they don't know the real me.  They can never know the real me.  And now the father is back.  Things have changed.  Everything has changed.  I always prided myself on being an outsider, but now I feel the need to connect with someone.  I saw myself in Jeremy But instead of helping him like Harry helped me, I gave him a piece of fortune cookie advice that he never even heard.  I failed him.  He deserves better And he'll get it from now on.  I guess I was wrong.  Jeremy did hear my advice.  He killed someone who deserved to die.  What's the status on Perry? I'm having him transferred right now.  The D. A.  wants to keep him at county, pending arraignment.  Maria, it was your decision making that led to his capture and arrest, and you made all our lives easier by getting the bastard to confess.  I'm just doing my job.  It feels good to be praising your police work instead of your politics for a change.  We need to make an official comment.  Don't worry.  I'll keep it short.  I'm just heading downstairs now for the press conference.  The press conference is over.  Oh, and, uh, don't worry.  I kept it short.  You got to be fucking kidding me.  That was my bust! This is my department.  Did you at least give me credit? Yes.  I just gave it to you.  Haven't you been listening? Ever since Harry's death, I've been alone But now for the first time I feel alone.  How long you need with the prisoner? As long as I can get.  Jeremy is gone, and Neil Perry will soon vanish into the catacombs of the system.  I have so many questions for him.  How did he discover my secrets? What was his message to me? He's been in my home, my photos my life.  He knows me.  Now I need to know him to connect face to face before he's beyond my reach forever.  Hi.  Who the fuck are you?       Previous EpisodeNext Episode"

        "script": "Previously on \"Dexter\" Open up, Perry, it's the police.  Open up.  Hey, Angel, I got him! They really found the ice truck killer? I saw him, Dex.  I chased him.  The fun part was hanging them like cattle right before I cut their throats.  Son of a bitch.  I have so many questions for him.  What was his message to me? Now I need to know him.  Hi.  The fuck are you? Paul Bennett.  Father on parole.  Dexter Morgan.  I can't think of anything clever to say.  Divorce papers   Sign them now, and I'll agree to supervised visits twice a week.  You think you can really make me back down? Are you fucking my wife? I just wish he'd go away.  I mean, why can't he just go away and disappear forever? All along, I thought this was a game my alter ego and I were playing.  But relationships change, evolve, and this one's getting deep.  I realize now my days are numbered.  So I'd better make the most of them.  Your instincts were dead on.  They're always dead on when it comes to killers.  Why is that? I'm watchin' you.  What are we looking at here? I'm thinking two circus clowns dancing.  You? No, it looks like a lobster.  See the claws? Why do bloodstains always look like crustaceans to you? I like seafood.  Rorschach would say you have a hard time relating to others.  Not as hard as her.  It does look like a suicide.  Can I get some light in here, please?   Damn power outages.    I don't know, Angel.  Most firearm suicides are committed by men.  Women tend to slash their wrists, take pills, something more ladylike.  Not in Miami.  We closed a couple of suicide cases just like this last year, remember? Look at this mess.  That's a fancy bathtub.  Rich husband? House husband.  And aspiring artist.  Promising.    So, she supported him?   It looks like that.  She was some kind of big time prosecutor.  Those other suicides we closed   those were high powered women too, right? I don't know.  I think so.  Note to self.  I don't care what it looks like.  Somebody killed her.  We're checking out all the possibilities, Mr.  Gayle.  Was your wife dealing with any emotional problem? You know, job stress, the usual, but she was working through it in therapy.  She have any other problems that you're aware of? Threats? Are you listening to me? Vanessa didn't kill herself.  Criminals stage suicides all the time.  You don't even know the guys she put away.  We'll check into it.  We need to collect your clothes for evidence   Standard procedure.  Come on.  I got to go.  There's a dead body in that house.  There's a hot body in here.  I so want to maul you right now.  I so want you too.  Call me when you're done, okay? Yeah.  I'll bring handcuffs.  Morgan, what took you so long? Playing \"hide the salami\" with Mr.  Prosthetics? I don't fuck and tell.  Since when? Can we go inside? I'm kind of wet.  Don't.  No, I need you to care of the neighbourhood.  See what you can find out about the victim's relationship with her husband.  It's always the husband, right? Looks like a suicide, but you never know   Younger guy, unemployed.  Maybe he was a boy toy and killed her for her money.  I'm on it.  Doakes is sending you away from a crime scene in a pouring rain and you're not putting up a fight?   I'm a team player.    You are? Fuck you! Hey, Dex, come on in.  Where's Rita? She's stuck in traffic.  Power's out in half the city.  Of course, I love the extra kid time, but court supervisor   not so much.  Hey, you know, I feel really bad about the last time I was here.  I didn't mean to get all alpha male on you.  It's just What are you supposed to say to the guy who's f'ing your wife while you're in jail? Sorry.  Sorry I'm late.  Thanks for holding down the fort.  Do you mind if I get going? I got kids of my own at home to look after.  No, no, no.  It's okay.    Dexter and I are here now.    Great.  Thank you.  Bye, kids.  Mom, Dexter, the lights are out.  They are? Hey, I brought hot chocolate.  Dad already made us some.  With extra marshmallows! Tag   You're it! I'd love some hot chocolate.  Take two.  Looks like he's got extra.  Come here, buddy.  Mom, can dad stay and put us to bed, please? I think that's why Dexter's here, sweetie.  Dexter doesn't mind.  Only a song, no story   It's way past your bedtime.  All right, bedbugs.  Let's leave these two alone.  It's not like they need a chaperone.  Meghan Dowd, Carolyn Jillian, and now Vanessa Gayle   All three powerful women, all three shot themselves in the past two years.  They've got to have more in common than career ambition and a fondness of firearms.  Why the sudden interest in suicides? Morbid curiosity.  What can I do for you? So many things I need the blood spatter report on Vanessa Gayle.  Blood spatter's inconclusive.  All I can tell is she was shot at close range.  I wish I had more for you.  Me too.  Maria.  The D. A.  needs the work sheet for the ice truck killer case.  I'm working on it.  When'd you talk to the D. A. ? We had dinner last night.  Mayor Allen took us out to celebrate Neil Perry's arrest   Hell of a good time.  Hiro de puta.  I'm the one who gets Perry to confess and he's got the mayor kissing his ass.  I wouldn't be too upset.  Matthews will be the one with the egg on his face soon enough.  You still believe we got the wrong guy? Perry's the pretender to the throne.  The real king is still out there, and he'll kill again.  It's just a matter of time.  Or the ice truck killer will use Perry as a get out of jail free card.  You really think that might happen? If Perry's the wrong guy and I let him take the fall? Definitely.  Thanks, Dexter.  What if Laguerta's right? What if the ice truck killer does disappear? No.  He's got unfinished business with me.  Still, I can't just sit on my hands waiting for something to happen.  I need a distraction.  Nothing like some Little Debbies and a worthy new adversary to clear my head.  Talk to me, ladies.  What do you have in common? Same sorority? Pilates instructor? Dr.  Emmett Meridian.  The three suicide sisters shared the same therapist   Dr.  Emmett Meridian.  He must be terrible at his job.  So far, he comes up squeaky clean   No malpractice suit, no disgruntled patients.  And I thought I was a master at damage control.  Perhaps I should schedule a session with the good doctor and try out a little reverse psychology.  Come on in, Sean.  Have a seat.  Thanks for seeing me on such short notice.  Hey, I expect the police to show up when I call, right? The least I can do is clear my lunch hour for a cop in need.  So What brought you here? A friend of mine died.  She killed herself.  I need to understand why.  How come? She had everything going for her.  It doesn't make sense.  To some people, death makes perfect sense.  Life   That's the puzzle, like you, Sean.  What really brought you here? I just told you I came   To talk about your friend's suicide, I know.  I think you're using this suicide deal as an excuse to come see me.  You're absolutely right.  How could you tell? I'm sensing you do it a lot to keep the world at arm's length.  And what are my real intentions? As soon as I pay for my lunch, you're gonna tell me that.  Excuse me a second.  Judging from what I've seen so far, I probably will.  This guy's good.  So why do his patients keep dying? Vanessa's estimated time of death was Monday at 7:00 p.  m.  Meridian was in session with Scott Solomon.  I wonder if Mr.  Solomon kept his appointment that night.  So, we got almond chicken, pork fried rice.  So, Sean, let's start with the basics.  You married? No.  Girlfriend? Yes.  Sex life? It's personal.  And this is therapy, where we share personal things.  You know, it might help me open up if you shared something about yourself.  Why did you become a psychiatrist? See what you just did? Trying to take control like that? You probably get away with it most of the time, too, right? That's a way of preventing other people from getting close to you.  Let me ask you something, Sean.  Have you ever been close to anybody? My foster father.  He's the only one who ever really knew me.  You're adopted? Harry took me in when I was 3.  So tell me about Harry.  What kind of stuff did you guys do together? You know, normal father son stuff.  All right.  Stop.  Enough.  Are you all right? I'm fine.  I'm fine.  Nice ambush.  That was the perfect point of attack.  I can't believe I finally got you.  I won.  This isn't a game, Dexter.  No, I know.  It's not supposed to be fun.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, it's just   You think I want to teach you these things? This is the only way I know how to keep you out of an electric chair! This is about survival, Dex.  Nothing else.  Got it? You've got a visitor, Perry.  You miss me? Don't flatter yourself.  I have to comb through your case before the trial, make sure I have my facts straight on the notorious ice truck killer.  I confessed.  What more do you need? The evidence to line up.  We haven't been able to match your prints against the partial on the lozenge wrapper we found at the abandoned hospital.  Liquid nitrogen   I use it to freeze the body parts.  It's extremely effective, but it burns like a bitch.  Or you knew your prints wouldn't match, so you purposely burned your fingertips to hide it.  Are you suggesting that I'm a liar? Just covering my bases, Neil.  We both want the same thing.  with Angelina? To see you convicted.  What's in it for me if I help you do your job? How about immortality? We found your mother's body under your house.  Now, you can go down as a pathetic loser who killed mom or the most heinous killer in Florida's history   Your choice.  If I'm going to become a legend, I need to be memorialized.  I want a reporter here to interview me   Front page.  You're not allowed to talk to the press before the trial.  If you want me to cooperate, I'm sure you'll find a way.  Meridian had one thing right.  I do crave control.  The longer the ice truck killer maintains radio silence, the less control I have.  Craigslist   It's desperate, I know, but apropos.  Personal ads are filled with desperation.  \"Tyler from Key West,\" \"speedos tanning on the beach,\" \"touched your tits on Friday night\"   At least these folks aren't just standing by waiting for something to happen, and neither am I.  \"Dear Ken,\" \"I'm in pieces.  \" \"Why the cold shoulder?\" \"Love, Barbie.  \" Hey, I got it.  Thanks.  Hey, I know you   Monday night at Meridian's.  You're always leaving your 7:00 when I'm arriving for my 8:00.  You missed last week, right? No, I was there.  I don't remember ever seeing you, though.    How do you like him?   Meridian? Best thing that's ever happened to me So far.  How about you? You finding him helpful? I'm a sociopath.  There's not much he can do for me.  Cute and funny.  Let me guess   Taken.  Girlfriend.  Lucky girl.  Well, thanks for the help, but I can handle it from here.  All right.  So Meridian has an alibi for the time of death.  My sexual hang ups and control issues aside, I need a follow up appointment   to dig a little deeper.  Isn't that what therapy's all about? Oh, my god.  I love your body.  I love your legs.  I love your arms.  I couldn't have made them better myself.  Are you crying? I'm fine.  Then what? I don't know.  I'm sure this is really hot, crying after sex.  Everything about you is hot.  Tell me what you're feeling.  It's It's just Every time I've ever been naked with someone we just fuck.  But not this time? This is different.  It feels like I hate saying this.  It sounds so fucking cheesy.  It feels like making love.  Ew Yes.  But, ew, promise me you'll never say that again.  What if I do? Are you gonna cry about it? You're so fucked up.  What's up, rock star? Look at you.  What you doing? Where's the supervisor? Oh, she called on my cell and canceled.  Who wants to play monster tag?   I do!   You? I'm coming after you.  You better run.  Paul, you know you're not allowed unsupervised visits.  I know.  Big bad Paul needs a babysitter.  It's your day off, right? Now, would it really be so terrible if we spent time with our kids together? I have a lunch date with Dexter.  Come on.  It'll be fun.  Mom, dad, come on! I guess I could call Dexter.  It's official   I'm nominating you for \"mom of the year\".  Here comes the monster.  Here comes the monster! Contrary to what Dr.  Meridian thinks, I don't always keep others at a distance.  Things are looking up already.  \"Hey Barbie.  How would you like to suck my cock?\" Or not.  Clearly nobody here is my missing partner in crime.  Hey, what's up? You were looking for me? What did forensics come back with on Vanessa Gayle? Gunpowder on her hand, none on her husband's, high angle trajectory, no drugs in the tox screen.  It all points to suicide.    No chance it was murder?   Too bad, huh? I had the husband pegged, too.  Was hoping he could help me score my own Sugar Mama.    Try Craigslist.    I already did   Nothing but cat ladies and saggy tits.  Miami Metro can close this case as a suicide, but I'm still not convinced.  Maybe my new therapist can shed some light on my doubts.  You seem on edge today.  I'm not getting what I came here for.  What'd you come here for? We established in our last visit that it wasn't to talk about suicide.    Or feelings.    Heaven forbid.  So, what do you want to talk about? Fakes   People who pass themselves off as something they're not.  Like a pre owned car salesman? A brave politician.  A Jew for Jesus.  A wolf in sheep's clothing.  Is that how you feel, Sean? Like you're hiding a dark secret? No, I wasn't talking about me.  Who you're talking about? You.  That's a common first time reaction to therapy.  You think I can't care about you, that I'm only pretending to care because I have another motive.  Bingo.  You got me.  I do have another motive.  It's called a paycheck.  But that doesn't mean that I can't care for my patients or enjoy my job.  How are things at your job? Frustrating, to tell you the truth.  What kind of forensics do you do? Blood spatter.  Most people can't stand blood.  I hate it.  Categorizing and analyzing must be very soothing for you.  Yeah, it is, actually.  So, okay, how are things with your girlfriend? She canceled lunch with me to be with her ex husband.  Sounds like a lot things are out of your control right now.  No wonder you cut yourself off from your emotions.  That way you never have to feel powerless.  So, then, what should I do? Accept that certain things are out of your hands.  Let go.  Hey, Morgan   I can't believe, out of two million sperm, you were the fastest swimmer.  What are you gonna do about it? I wanted to kill him, dad.  It must have been tough for you to walk away, son.  I'm proud that you did that.  Don't be, because I still want to kill him.  When's that gonna go away? I think I have everything I need, Mr.  Perry.  When's the story gonna run? Well, they're saving space for tomorrow, front page.  I just got to get back and write.  Thanks so much for your time.    How was your interview?   It was fine.  You ready to talk about the case? Sure.  As soon as I get to talk to a reporter.    You just did.    Oh, give me a break.  That poser was one of your cop buddies, But nice try.  In case you forgot, Neil, you're the one in jail.  I call the shots.  Wrong.  I could invoke my Miranda rights at any time   and lawyer up.    It's that too wrong beacause if you wanted a lawyer, you'd have one by now.  I know your game, lieutenant.  You think I'm a fraud and you're trying to prove it, but the truth is you're the fraud.  You know what, Neil? I'm really not in the mood for your shit today.  I found out how you got promoted.  Back when you and sergeant Doakes were still partners, Doakes got the drop on a major coke dealer,   brought you along for the ride.    How did you get? When the perp bailed from a Third Story apartment, Doakes took the fire escape, sent you to cover the stairs.  Just in case.  Only You got lucky, and you made the headline grab, and so the legend began.  I wonder if Doakes would have made a good lieutenant.    I deserved that promotion.    I'm sure you did.  It was a big bust.  Not as big as catching me, of course, but, uh, let's be honest.  You didn't catch me.  Your captain did.  At least that's what they're saying on the news.  My therapist wants me to accept the things that are out of my hands.  Tragically for him, he's not out of my hands, Not if I can find proof that the death of at least three women under his care was not a coincidence.  Breaking and entering.  I hope he got my good side.  Now, what's he recording for posterity's sake? Goodbye, Dexter.  Hello, ladies.  I need another prescription.  I'm sorry, Vanessa.  I can't do that.  Just one more, please.  We talked about this.  The antidepressants were a temporary crutch so that you could start taking steps on your own.  But you don't understand.  I can't do this on my own.  I can't even get out of fucking bed.  I just   I want to die.  Look at me.  I understand the appeal of death, okay? No more pain.  All the career pressure, the hopelessness, gone.  In many cultures, there's no stigma attached to taking one's life.  Suicide's respected, even revered as a matter of personal conscience.  How do most people do it? Well, painkillers are the most common.  But they're entirely unreliable.  The truly courageous of heart use guns.  You took women who trusted you at their weakest possible moment, and rather than help them, you suggested they end it all.  God, you even gave them permission to use a gun.  You're a mean one, Mr.  Shrink.  Create their drug addiction, pull them off, then fill their addled heads with noble thoughts of suicide.  I think I've had a breakthrough in therapy.  Hey, I got your texts.  Is everything    okay?   It is now.  Okay, just, I wanted to see you.  I felt bad about missing lunch to be with Paul and the kids.  I hope you didn't get the wrong idea.  No, of course not.  How'd it go? Really good and incredibly scary.  For the first time in a long while, I saw how easy it would be for me to fall back into my old life.    Why is that scary?   Because I like my new life.  And I finally feel like I'm in control.  I never felt that way with Paul.  I do with you.  This is a disaster.  I chose Rita because she was damaged.  If she gets better, I'll lose her for sure.  I'm ready, Dexter.  I don't know what I've been so afraid of.  You're the perfect boyfriend.  I want you to spend the night, for real.  I'm so sorry.  I came over here because I thought something was wrong.  But tonight's really not a good night.  I'm right in the middle of a case.  I'm way too distracted.  Now? It's so late.  That's all the more reason to get back to work.  The clock's ticking.  Here.  But I'll call you tomorrow.  Okay? Okay.  Shit.  I can't have sex with Rita.  Every time I sleep with a woman, she sees me for what I really am   Empty   And then she's gone.  But I don't want Rita to go, which means I have to deal with this.  I can't kill Meridian yet.  I need another therapy session.  Stay where you are.  I'm armed.  With bad puns? You said you needed a favor.  What's up? Take off your pants.  Oh, I should have known it was that kind of favor.  You never ask me to come by before work.  No, but I like the way you think.  I have a patient who lost both her legs in a car accident,   really brutal.    Like your mom? Which is why I want to do something special for her.  I want to give her a new smokin' pair of legs     Yours.    No.    Let me just take a cast.    No way, no.  It'll take 20 minutes, tops.    I don't     Come on, please? Stop being such a chick.  Sit down.  Feels good.  Can I make one of your cock? That'd be a hell of a story to tell the bullpen, huh? Not likely.  I haven't told anyone about us.  Embarrassed about banging Captain Hook? Not even a little.  Then why? I guess this matters to me.  So if I talk about it and it goes away, I'm actually losing something.  That retarded? No.  But I got to tell you, I'm not going anywhere.  Seriously? And neither are you, 'cause I got your leg.  Where the hell you been? With my boyfriend.    Boyfriend?   Yep.  We just fucked in his office.  And we're having dinner tomorrow night.    You looking for me?   Yeah.  Shut the door.  Did you tell anyone about our bust, the one that got me promoted? No.  Nobody in the press? Maria, we talked about this when it happened.  It would fuck up your rep and make me look like a whiny bitch.  It's bad for both of us.  So then the only way to access that information would be to read to police report, right? I guess.  We have to have our firewall checked.  She was sitting on top of me, basically naked asking me to spend the night, and I didn't know what to do.  It's okay, Sean.  Don't beat yourself up.  Your girlfriend really means something to you.  I know that.  If she means something, why do I run away from her? To the same reason you work so hard to shut everybody else out.  Cause you're afraid they won't like what they see.  Yeah, I think you're right.  How can I change that? Well, for starters, you accept the fact that we all have a big, bad wolf hiding inside of us, a darkness we don't want anyone else to see.    Do you?   Of course I do.  Really? And how do you deal with your wolf? Well, first of all, I accepted that it was there.  I made friends with it.  And now I just let it out for a big meal once in a while.  At least three times that we know about.  Can we get back to the sex thing? This is all about sex.  The reason you avoid sexual intimacy is because you don't want to surrender control.  No, I've surrendered control.  It's not like my girlfriend hasn't been, you know, south of the border.  That's not what I'm talking about.  Intimacy   Really letting go face to face   There's nothing more difficult than that.  The minute you start to accept who you are, you just might feel free enough to share that intimacy together.  What are you doing? I'd like to talk you through a deep relaxation technique.  It might bring some things to the surface.  What kinds of things? There must have been a time in your life when you felt powerless, right? Foster child, no control over your destiny.  If we can bring some of those memories to the surface, we might find the root of your control issues.  First, I want you to close your eyes and focus on your breathing.  I want you to count each breath, okay? In, 1, and out, 2.  Just give it a try.  This is ridiculous.  I could be killing him right now.  Now I want you to think of a time when you felt completely and totally powerless.  Hey, Morgan.  You still fucking your sister? Leave me alone, Josh.  I told you to walk away! God damn it, Dexter.  There are consequences to everything you do in life.  Lose control, become powerless, and it's over.    I found the grave, son.    I'll be like this forever? Mommy! I have to get out of here.  Sean, come here.  Sean, Sean.  Sean! Oh, my god.  Are you okay? Stay.  Stay with me.  You're sweet.  I am? Next time, we'll figure out what to tell the kids so you don't have to sneak out like this.  You want there to be a next time? And a time after that.  Don't you? No.  I mean, yeah.  I just I didn't freak you out? Why would you think that? Dexter, there's nothing you could ever do that would scare me away.  I really hope you came to apologize.  Nope.  I came for a consult.  And you brought beverages? I got this on loan from the morgue.  Now, I could use an expert opinion, specifically your expert opinion.  See, we can't figure out exactly how the killer cut off this head.  Can you? Nope.  Really? I think you can.  I mean, you chop people up, don't you? Maybe you need a closer look.  No! Keep it away.  I talked to the medical examiner.  He couldn't confirm how your mom died.  Said it might have been a heart attack.    I killed her.    You don't have the balls.  I mean, you had to wait till she died to chop her up.  And even then you were too squeamish to cut off her head.  Not exactly the same as stuffing roadkill, is it? Oh, fuck you! Serial killers get all the glory, don't they, Neil? Especially the ice truck killer.  You know, you're not the first groupie to take credit   for someone else's work.    Oh, bullshit! I know details about the case, things that weren't published in the newspapers.  That's because you hacked into our computer system.  That's why I had the I. T.  guys check our firewall.  The DMZ was breached.  You read all our police reports.  You even got yourself a nice paneled car last month.    Nice touch, by the way.    Why are you doing this? Because you're not a killer.  You're a coward and a fake, aren't you?   Maybe you need another look.    No, take it away.  All right, I lied, okay? Just, I need you to take it away from me Please.  So, what's on your mind, lieutenant? We got a lot to get done before Perry's trial.  Yeah, about that trial   I've got some bad news.  Perry recanted his confession this morning.  What are you talking about? I was going over some details with him at county, and he admitted that he gave us a false confession.  He's a wannabe, Tom.  Just wanted his 15 minutes, that's all.  How do you know which time he was lying? All due respect, Maria, if we dropped charges every time someone recanted his confession, our jails would be empty.  We're going to trial.  All due respect, Captain, that's really not up to you.  It's up to the D. A.  I understand your frustration, Maria, but I reviewed the D. A.  work sheets.  The evidence is compelling.  We'll move forward with the trial as planned.  Fair enough.  If that's what you two want, I'm fully behind it.  I was really worried about you.  You sure you're all right? I kept calling your house, but I think the number you gave me didn't work.  You wouldn't have reached me anyway, 'cause I was at my girlfriend's.  I spent the night.  Face to face.  Sean! That's very good.  It's all good, doctor.  I even stopped worrying about that friend of mine who's been out of touch.  You can't control other people, you know? This is a real breakthrough.  You should be proud of yourself.  I am proud.  Truth be told, I never expected to make progress in therapy.  That's not true.  If that were true, you never would have come in here in the first place.  What do you want to focus on today? Glad you asked that.  I'm gonna tell you something that I've never told anyone before.  Okay.  I'm a serial killer.  Oh, god! Oh, that feels so   so amazing to say out loud! Well, you must be letting go, because I've never heard you make a joke before.  I'm not joking.  I kill people.  There it is again.  You should try it.  I know.  Your big, bad wolf has racked up a tidy little death toll.  I'm just kidding.  I disabled the cameras, and I copied the files.  I don't know what you're talking about.  Then focus on your breathing, maybe you'll remember   Meghan, Carolyn, Vanessa.  Those sessions are confidential! I'm a control freak, I know.  But I watched your home movies.  It's amazing stuff   Drugs, guns, and a crazy psychiatrist.  No wonder you're so well versed in control issues.  You got quite the God complex.  This session's over.  Not so fast, doc.  You're awake.  Shall we analyze your dreams? No.  That's right.  You've already told me everything I need to know, except why powerful women? You took powerful women and made them powerless.  They left behind families, children.  I have to confess, I'm a little conflicted.  You've helped me make a major self discovery.  The fact that I'm a killer that's something I can't control.  You helped me to accept what I really am.  I'm grateful for that.  But I was raised with a certain set of principles.  I'm sorry, doc.  Actions have consequences, and this is yours.  I'm gonna have to let you go.  * My darling * * Turn the radio up for that sweet sound * * Hold me close, never let me go * * Keep this feelin' alive, make me lose control *   Hello?   Is that Eric Carmen? No.  What's up? I'm running late.  I'm in the middle of some housework.  If I don't get it done before we see, it's gonna drive me crazy.  I never knew you were so anal.  And I'm a neat freak.  You're just full of surprises, huh? Oh, you have no idea.  I'll be there as soon as I can, okay? Okay.  Barbie, be patient.  One day we'll share a cold one.

Why can't he just go away and disappear forever? I so want to maul you right now.  I so want you to.  It's different.  It feels like I hate saying this.  It sounds fucking cheesy.  It feels like making love.  \"Barbie, be patient.  \"One day we'll share a cold one.  \" Thank god for showers.  Private time to think   Harder to come by now that I'm in a real relationship.  Do you mind? Not at all.    Could you pass the soap?   Yeah.  It's locked! Mom, I got to pee! I'll be right there, sweetie!   Hold on a second, buddy!   I can't! Sorry.  One bathroom house.  Nature calls.  Cool.  How did you get that ugly scar? Cody! Sword fight   I won.  Mom, I got to brush.  Whatever happened to knocking? I'm gonna be late for school.  You brush, you pee, I'm just gonna Wow, big scar.  Sword fight   He won.  I mean, what does \"separation\" mean to you? What \"separation\" means to me is that you're separated, and you work it out.  Now, this was false pretenses.  I mean, I knew she wanted a divorce when she asked for the separation   she lied.  Yeah, and you didn't when you were cheating on her, right?   \"Cheat\"   One cheat.    Got it.  That's in the singular.    One.    Okay.  And I felt so crappy, I told her the next day.  That's your problem.  You're too damn honest.  She wouldn't even talk about it.  And I tried to get her to see a counselor with me.  Forget that.    Stop the car, man!   What? Stop the goddamn car! Stop! Police! Doakes! Doakes!   You all right?   Yeah.  The suspect's name was Jacques Bayard, according to his driver's license.    Haitian?   That'd be my guess.  All right.  Let's go over it again.  I saw a gun in the suspect's waistband.  I went to question him, and he took off running when he saw me.  Angel, you saw all this? Yeah, I saw Bayard bolt, and I turned the car around in pursuit.  All right, and when you went under the causeway He took a shot at me.  I took cover and returned fire from that corner.  No, not from there.  Yeah, from fucking right there.  But If you shot him from right there, the blood spatter would go in that direction.  Look at the patterns.  You questioning me? 'Cause I got questions for you.  The man's just doing what he's supposed to do.  The man is a fucking creep job! James.  Just focus on the facts, okay? The D. A. 's team is ready for you.  You good? I'm good.  Yeah.  You're up next.  Sorry, but I didn't invent physics.  He just got mixed up is all.  Hell, I'm not even sure what the hell happened.  Trauma can distort the memory.  Come on.  I want you and Rita to meet my boyfriend.  It's just hard to get a babysitter on a Friday night.  Dex, you're my brother.  You should know my boyfriend.  You really like using the \"B\" word, don't you? Well, Rudy is my goddamn boyfriend, so stop making bullshit excuses.  Honestly, our last double date was a little awkward.  I just want to make sure this one's gonna stick.  Well, thanks for the vote of fucking confidence! Dex, Rudy's different.  I feel safe with him.  I think I'm falling for him.  Excuse me.  Where can I find Dexter Morgan? Right here.  Oh, that was easy.  An urgent registered letter? Maybe you won a sweepstakes.    Dex, you got a second?   Yeah.  Hey, you finish your report on the shooting? I'm walking it up to I. A.  right now.  You still think Doakes' version doesn't add up? Blood never lies.  Shit.  Listen, um Can you sit on that till I talk to Doakes? Here.  Now it's yours to sit on, stand on, do what you want.    Thanks.    You're welcome.  You know, it's a federal offense to read someone else's mail.  \"We regret to inform you of the death of your father\"? Dad died 10 years ago.  This isn't about Harry.  \"Joseph Driscoll of Dade City, Florida, names his son, \"Dexter Morgan of Miami, \"as his executor.  \" It's a will.  Well, he can't be your biological father.  Dad said he died before you came to live with us.  He wouldn't make a mistake like that.  \"The body's awaiting cremation while they notify the next of kin.  \" I'm your only next of kin.  Don't you fucking forget it.  Oh, and I inherited a house.  I know the truth, because Harry always told me the truth.  He had to.  He was teaching me principles, a code.  He knew what I would become without it.  So Joseph Driscoll of Dade City must have been mistaken.  You know what this is? This is Dexter's new birth certificate.  The adoption finally went through.  You're a Morgan now.  I thought I was already a Morgan.  Well, you have been to us, but it's official now.  It took a long time and a lot of hurdles.    This is an important day for us.    Hey, dad? How come you never told us what happened to Dexter's real parents? Well, they died.  I know, but how?   I don't know.    Let's not talk about it.  No, how did they die, dad? It was an accident, a tragic accident.  So, have you found out anything else about this Joe Driscoll? Well, I looked online.  I even   looked at police records.  There are no birth records, no driver's license, just the deed to the house And a mention in the local paper about his bowling team.  That's odd.  Yeah, I spoke to the probate lawyer, the guy who drafted the will.  And apparently Joseph Driscoll was an insurance adjuster of sound mind, with no doubts about who I was.  Dexter, you're not feeling any of this, are you? You're obviously so overwhelmed that you've shut down.  Maybe.  It's too much for you to handle.  Yeah.  I guess.  So I think I should come with you.  Oh, no, you don't have to do that.  Trust me.  You'll need me.  I fell asleep.  Sex like that takes a lot out of a person.  So, are we still seeing your brother for dinner Friday night? No.  He's got to go to Dade City.  What's in Dade City?   I told you he was adopted, right?   Yeah.  Some dead guy up in Dade fucking City thought he was Dexter's biological father and left him a house.  Really? Man.  It's a mistake, a big one.  Still, though, that's got to open up some old wounds.  When are you leaving? Me? I'm gonna stay in bed with you all weekend.  I thought you two were close.  We are.  Dex just likes to deal with things on his own.    He doesn't need my help.    Or He doesn't know how to ask for it.  I left a message so we wouldn't have to have this conversation.  Yeah, which is why I hustled over here, so we could hash this out like adults.  Admirable, Paul, but this adult is still going out of town.  Not if it means blowing off my scheduled visit with my kids.  That's not your call.  The kids are already settled at Colleen's.  You can have your visit when we get back.  It's just that I already laid out cash for the tickets.  A death in the family trumps the circus.  Dexter is not your family.  I am.  You ready? Hey, Paul.  Better hit the road.  They should have served a cardiologist with these burgers.  We had to eat them.  Junk food's the unwritten rule of the road.  It's nice.  The lawyer said there should be a key under the mat.  Are you my new neighbors?! No.  No, we're just here to clear up some things with the estate.  So sad about Mr.  Driscoll.  He was only 60, you know   Too young for a heart attack.  He used to clean my gutters every fall.  I don't know what I'm gonna do now Unless you know how to clean gutters.  We're not gonna be here for that long.  But, uh, you have a good day.  A bachelor lived here, that's for sure.  Well, we can head back tomorrow morning, as soon as I straighten things out at the morgue.  I don't want a house in Dade City.  Which means it's gonna need to be packed up.  And I don't think anybody else is gonna do it, so I guess that leaves us.  Told you you'd need me.    Hey, James.    Hey, man.  I. A.  is pressing me on my report of the shooting.  Yeah.  There's just one thing that I can't get clear on.  It's pretty clear from where I was standing.  Yeah Except I could have sworn that I heard your 9 millimeter go off before the.  38.  Now, there's lots of reasons it could have gone down that way.  If Bayard even just aimed at you, it's still all right to shoot.  Except he shot first, when I came around the corner.  Yeah.  Maybe you're confused about that too because the blood spatter report says   it couldn't have gone down that way.    You saying I'm a liar? No.  I'm saying that maybe you're not remembering right.  This may come as a fucking shock to you, Angel, but you're not the only honest cop in Miami.  Look, I just want to know why a man is dead.  You want to come at me, you come at me straight.  You want it straight? I did not see a gun! A ngel.  I need to talk to you.  Help me out, man.    Is that Joe?   Must be.  It's weird, but he looks a little bit like you But not really.  Those seem to be the only pictures in the house.  There's no family or kids' photos.  Lonely.    Dexter.  Hi.    Hey.  Surprise.  I know you can't ask for my help, but it's my duty to, you know Help while you deal with old wounds Or wha  Jesus.  Whatever.  I'm here.  So it appears.  And this is Rudy.  I've waited a long time to meet you.  And you must be Rita.  Hi.  He came here for me   For the both of us.  Isn't he great? A lot of work to pack all this up.  Even with the four of us, it'll take us the whole weekend.  The whole weekend? Where should I put our stuff? It's too eerie, sleeping in a dead man's house.  I saw a Motel 6 on the way in.  We could stay here and save the money.  I mean, it is late, and we'd probably get more packing done if we stayed here.  It's up to you, Dex.  Just say the word.  As long as you don't mind the sofa bed.  Okay, I'll go look for some clean sheets.  How did a death turn into a couples' weekend? Luckily, I get up earlier than normal people.  Coffee? Thanks.  I've got to hit the morgue.  Want company? No.    Thank you, though.    It's private.  I get it.  I gave Joe a physical once a year, like clockwork, so no history of heart disease, but it happens.  It appears so.  We were about to send him to a crematorium when we found you.  We thought his son should have a chance to pay his last respects.  I'm not his son.  Estrangement in a family is a shame, but death is the great unifier.  That's an interesting tattoo.  Joe said he picked that up in Nam.  You can be proud.  He was a patriot.  Uh, perhaps he was also an ex convict.    Excuse me?   It's a prison tattoo.  It's done with a pen and ballpoint ink.  It's three or four decades old, judging by the fade.  Son, I knew Joe.  He was no ex convict.  He was a good man, a quiet man, and a damn good bowler.  How'd you determine cardiac arrest? Was there damage to the coronary artery? It's, uh, professional curiosity.  I work in forensics, down in Miami.  I see.  Well, uh, I found microaneurisms in the retinas.  It's common with seizures during a heart attack.  It's also a sign of diabetic retinopathy.  Son, I may be a small town doctor, but I know a heart attack when I see one.  Who knows what caused it   Stress, inactivity French fries   But knowing won't bring him back.  It's hard to accept so many unanswered questions, but sometimes No, you're right Dr.  Pittman.  Yeah, this is really hard.  You mind if I just take a minute alone with Dad? I'll be next door in my office.  Masuka.  Hey, it's Dexter Morgan.  Dude, I know your last name.  I need a favor, a DNA comparison.  I thought you were away with the girlfriend.  What? She surfing the Crimson wave? I'm just helping out a local agency.  I'm gonna send you two blood samples.  I need it A. S. A. P.  Do a tox screen, will you? Hey, Romeo, if this is your idea of a romantic weekend, you're gonna be a bachelor for a very long time.  Yeah.  Run another I. V.  Let's keep his blood levels volumized.  What's his pressure? It's 80 and dropping.  We may need to do a belly tap.  Hey, Dex.  Buddy, I'm here.    It hurts, dad.    What happened? He tried to climb a fence to get Debra's ball, but a dog chased after him, and he fell on a wrought iron post.  Is he gonna be all right? We can keep him stable for a while.  But he's gonna need surgery to repair some internal bleeding, and that's a problem.  Can we talk over here, please? Dex, I'll be right back.  Hold your brother's hand, sweetie.  Okay, the complication is with your son's blood type.  I don't want to talk about this.  Why are you being like this?! You don't need to mention that in front of anybody.  Are you crazy?! He could die.  You got to do something quick.  You've got to go now.  So, you heard the.  38 go off before sergeant Doakes' 9 millimeter.  Then I went under the causeway, and I saw the suspect Mr.  Bayard Mr.  Bayard on the ground, his gun lying next to him.  And you're sure it was Mr.  Bayard's gun? Well, the.  38 wasn't mine.  And Sergeant Doakes had his niner in his hands.  Did you see Mr.  Bayard carrying the gun before the foot chase began? Sergeant Doakes did.  Did you see Mr.  Bayard acting suspiciously? Did you know Mr.  Bayard worked as a janitor? I   How the fuck would I know that? Never got so much as a parking ticket since he immigrated from Haiti 15 years ago.  He got a lot more than that this time, didn't he? Are you sure you heard the.  38 go off before Sergeant Doakes' 9 millimeter? Joe bought this house outright in 1976, paid cash, no records before that.  No records, no childhood photos The guy was 60, but it's like his life started when he was 30.  You know, you're right.  He's right.  So, what happened between years one and 29? Maybe he butchered his entire family.  Yeah Or he walked out on his two wives and a lot of bad debt.  The guy was a loser, after all.  Who else owns this many bowling balls? What do you think, Dex? I think Joe spent some time in prison, probably mixed with some bad people.  Maybe he had to hide from them.  Whatever it was, drugs were involved   Narcotics anonymous.  Paul used to get these, except he never made it past the welcome chip.  Looks like Joe was clean for Let me guess   Well, Joe said no to the drugs, but not his rock 'n' roll.  Nothing in his collection post 1980.  Got to love a purist.  Oh, good.  Dancing.    Hello?   Hey, babe.  It's Paul.  Just making sure dear Dexter is dealing decently with his dead dad.  We're fine.  Everyone's fine, OK?   We'll see you on Monday.    No, no, no.  Talk to me.  You having fun? 'Cause I'm not.    Paul.    I would have.  I could have taken my kids to the circus.  We'd be eating peanuts right now, stepping in elephant shit.  Paul, this is not helping my confidence in you.  Oh, I think you've got enough confidence for both of us.  Look, if you want to work towards building more visitation days, not less, you need to avoid this kind of behavior right here.  Now, I think you might just want to politely hang up.  Okay.  You're right.  I'm sorry.  You have a great weekend.  A secret life   The only thing Joe and I have in common.  There's nothing else in this house to connect us.  Hiding out? Cleaning up.  I can only imagine what you're going through.  A lot of lemon fresh joy.  You joke.  It's good defense, by the way.  Thank you.  I think.  Still, the possibility has got to be weighing on you.  What possibility? That Joe could actually be your dad.  The only way that's a possibility is if Harry was wrong.  And, uh, that's just not possible.  Or he lied.  Don't you worry, little man.  You're not gonna feel a thing.  I thought there was a problem   you know, the blood? Your dad fixed it.  See, you have a very special blood type   A. B.  negative.  It's hard to come by, and our supply was low.  But your dad knew somebody with blood just like yours.  You're very lucky.    Can I have a moment with my son?   Yeah.  Hey, Dex.  Everything's gonna be fine.  You'll be good as new.  I will? Hey, would I lie to you? When my father was dying, he just asked me for one thing   Deber\u00eda ser un hombre honesto.  \"Be an honest man.  \" That's all he asked.  I made him that promise, and that's why I'm a cop.  Now this Haitian man is dead, and I don't know why, but I know it ain't right.  But if I talk I'll be a rat to the whole precinct.    But if I lie     Hold up.  Go ahead.  The blood spatter doesn't match Doakes' report.  Also I heard Doakes' 9 millimeter go off before the.  38.    But he must have had good cause.    So Doakes fired first? Doakes fired first.  I hope tuna's all right.  Mmm, love me a little mercury.  That's Dexter's.  Oh, he's out stealing garbage can space from the neighbors.  Criminal   I like it.  It's the station.  Morgan here.  Wait.  Did I call the hot Morgan by mistake? Freudian.  My subconscious has been exposed.  Well, zip it up and tell me what's going on.  I got the results.  On Doakes' shooting? Has he been cleared? On the DNA test.  What DNA test? You trusted dad your entire life, so why question him now? Am I missing something? DNA test? Masuka called? Your biological father was dead.  Dad told us that.  I remember.  So, the DNA came back negative? It was a match.  Joe Driscoll was your bio dad.  Interesting.  Do you think dad lied? I think he might have known Joe was here Five hours up I 95 my whole life.  Well, he must have had a damn good reason.  And I'm not gonna let some guy you didn't even know draw him into question.  Deb, I'm not questioning anything.  That's why you got a tox screen, too.  I need to clear my head.  Where are your car keys? Deb, I ordered the tox screen because Joe had no history of heart disease and the coroner's report was inept.  You did it because, for some reason, he is important to you.  It was professional curiosity.  Then you will be professionally glad to know that the only toxin in his system was a sedative, which he probably took to I don't know, sleep.  That would surprise me.  Joe was 30 years sober, I haven't found anything stronger than Advil in his medicine cabinet.  It wouldn't be the first time an addict fell off the wagon, Rita.  Or someone slipped him the sedative so he wouldn't struggle when he was injected with something.  Like? Diabetic insulin.  It can cause cardiac arrest.  We've seen it before.  It's nearly impossible to detect unless you can find a point of injection, which I wasn't looking for, but if I had a chance   to examinate the body, I     Jesus Christ! He's not even your family! Mom and dad were.  I am.  Are you gonna start questioning me now? You? Why would I   Joe Driscoll was obviously bad fucking news, which is why dad didn't want you to know anything about him! Doesn't that matter to you?! I don't know what you want from me.  I want what dad wanted.  I want nothing to do with this guy.  Let's just finish packing up this crappy house and walk the fuck away! All right.  That sounds like a good plan.  Okay? I guess I understand why Deb is upset.  We both idolized Harry, lived by what he taught us Though Deb never had to be taught not to kill innocent people.  That's why she doesn't understand why I need to know.  Howdy, neighbor.  Let me get that for you.  Well, thank you.  I was just wondering   Did you happen to notice any visitors over at Joe's last week? Visitors? Oh, I'm not sure.  I'm just wondering if he has any outstanding bills   A gardener, maybe, or a delivery person, repairman? Well, come to think of it, there was a, um, cable repairman here last week.  He was polite.  But, you know, he couldn't fix my TV antenna.  You remember what he looked like? Well, he had dark hair Average height   Normal, I suppose.  I did some checking on our suspect Jacques Bayard.  You lending I. A.  a hand? I just like to know what's going on in my department.  And what is going on? Turns out Mr.  Bayard changed his name when he immigrated here.  Used to be Rene Thibault, a former officer in the Haitian military.  Didn't your tour in the army include some special op in Haiti? Right.  \"Special\" means you don't talk about it.  But I know you've heard as many horror stories as I have about what went on down there with those death squads.  What were they called? Tonton Macoute.  Yeah, \"the bogeymen.  \" They did a lot of terrible things, killed a lot of people.  They made mothers carry the heads of their dead sons, forced fathers to rape their daughters.  They tied cinder blocks around people's necks and drowned them and put mutilated bodies in trees and killed anybody who tried to take them down.  This man, Jacques Bayard, if he did those things he deserved a lot worse than he got.  Don't worry, James.  It'll be over soon.  I know it will.  If Joe was shot up with insulin, there will be an injection welt Maybe between his toes or in a freckle.  If it's there, I'll find it.  Small towns.  Come on, Dr.  Pittman, which crematorium did you send Joe to? Hey! You! stop! Come on! Get in! Heard you sneak out.  Took a guess where you were headed.  Figuring I'd need a ride? Figured I could talk you out of it.  No such luck, huh? Deb will be delighted.  As far as I know, you went out for a walk.  Jesus, Dex, did you steal something? Well, my fingerprints were all over it.  I figured it was prudent to get rid of the evidence.  It's just a box of ashes.    Joe was cremated, then?   Yep.  Guess you weren't able to find out if he was injected with anything.  No.    What are you gonna do with him?   I don't know.  Hmm, dumpster? I have a better idea.  You know No matter what Harry said, no matter what Deb thinks, that's your father.  Cardboard box? I know you don't want to acknowledge it, which is why you're running around, breaking and entering, searching for some killer.  But you took that because there's a part of you that knows that this that box is your real father.  My father.  Sounds strange.  I know.  You all right? I was just getting some air.  Oh, hey, I found something in Joe's closet.  It's just a bunch of papers.  They're over there.  Any clues? Hey, buddy.    How you feeling?   Good.  It kind of itches, but they have ice cream here.  Life's a trade off.  What are you making there? A thank you card.  See? The nurse brought me the crayons and everything.  Who's it for? Well, she said I should thank the man who gave me the blood.  I mean, that's normal, right, giving thank you cards? Yes, it is.  It's just that he's gone.  And we won't be seeing him again.  I'm sorry.  That's all right.  It doesn't really mean anything.  Yeah, it does.  You keep drawing, son.  I'll make sure it finds him.  Okay.  You had the case dropped? Excuse me.  I. A.  dropped Doakes' case.  Do you seriously think I have any say over what I. A.  does? I put everything on the line.  I told I. A.  the truth, and there's a lot of evidence to back that up.  What the hell happened? Maria! I deserve to know.  All I know is that I. A.  got a call from an agency in Washington.    What agency?   I'm guessing military.  They said the case involved some   sensitive foreign relations issues, so they were gonna handle it from there.  They disappeared it.  I always knew Doakes had a history with them.  I figured Special Forces, but this kind of reach   You think it was black ops, CIA? Maybe.  Probably.  And I ratted him out.  Jesus Christ.  Angel You did what you thought was right.  Squeak, squeak.  Do you have a problem? Officer Benson, you just bumped into your superior.  I believe you owe detective Batista an apology! Yes, sir.  I'm sorry, sir.  I know I should be sorry that we met under these circumstances, but truthfully, I think it was the best way to get to know you.  Realtor says you won't get much for it.  More than if I kept it.  Are we good? We're fine.  All right.  I'll see you back at the station.  Cable repair man.  Wait! Wait! No, no, don't go.  Wait! Please, I want to ask you something.  Wait! Alone again.  Finally.  You know what? I'm glad you were here.  Thought you would be.  The cable repairman   Did he say anything about my TV antenna?! No! Rita, it's me.  They're asleep.  Yeah, well, I should have been here, okay? It's late, and you're drunk and you can't keep coming by here unannounced.  You don't call the shots, okay? Paul, I want you to leave.  I don't give a fuck what you want.  I want my fucking kids! You're gonna scare them.  They don't want to see me? Those kids are gonna remember who the head of this fucking family is.  You're right.  I've been awful.  I just didn't realize I was hurting you so much.  But I can make it up to you.  Let me try.  Where are you going? Want to play rough? Huh? Is that what you want? No! No! Fucking whore.  Come on.  Come on! Wake up.  Wake up.  Come on.  I had a father Someone other than Harry who called me son.  The thought never even occurred to me.  Harry was all I needed.  It was Harry who always had the answers.  He knew who was good, bad, safe And dangerous.  I built my life on Harry's code.  I lived by it.  But Harry lied.  Why would he do that? What else don't I know? My concrete foundation is turning to shifting sand.  Maybe Rudy was right   You never can truly know anyone.      Previous EpisodeNext Episode"

I'd like to talk you through a deep relaxation technique.  It might bring some things to the surface.  Mama! It was a match.  Joe Driscoll was your bio dad.  And this is Rudy.    Dexter.    Hey.  I have waited a long time to meet you.  Why the different nail polishes? What the hell's this guy thinking? And the real king is still out there.  Hungry.  Ready.  He'll kill again.  It's just a matter of time.  Dex, Rudy's different.  I feel safe with him.  I think   I'm falling for him.  Divorce papers.  Sign them now, and I'll agree to supervised visits twice a week.  You think you can really make me back down? Are you fucking my wife? The kids are already settled at Colleen's.  You can have your visit when we get back.  I just wish he'd go away.  I mean, why can't he just go away and disappear forever? No! Fucking whore! Come on, buckaroos.  It's Monday.  Can't be late Monday.  Throws the whole week off.  What about breakfast? Made and eaten.    And the kids' lunches?   Packed and ready to go.  Did you tell the locksmith? Yeah, new locks on every door, reinforced strike plates, seven pin keyways.  Here you go, buddy.  Why don't you kids go wait in my car? I want to talk to your mom for a sec.  Are you gonna make out? None of your business.    Are you?   Astor.  Rita, you don't have to do this, you know.  Getting attacked by your ex husband merits a day off.  I'm fine.  I'm not gonna let Paul control my life anymore.  Those days are over.  It's gonna be okay.  The police have been notified.  They'll find him.  What if they don't? I got you some pepper spray.  Just aim for the eyes.  Hey, you want some? It's Kirk Bliloc's cake.  I had some at Kirk's birthday, See, you have lunch every day with your boyfriend, you miss a thing or two around here.  Cake's still good.  It's mocha, I think.  It started out vanilla.  Guys, you should look at this.  Put that thing down, for God's sake.  It was addressed to Homicide.  Put it down! Jesus, is that blood? Morgan, get your ass over here.  Ass en route.  You're the blood expert.  What is this shit? It's a little watery for jam.  Maybe you should open it.  What if there's an airborne toxin in here waiting to be released? I got to wash my hands.  So gullible.  What is it? Well, it's definitely blood.  Wait, there's something in here.  Marina View hotel.  It's a key.  May be some sort of promotional gag.  You know, stay the weekend, you get a jar of blood.  Show and tell's over.  Let's try and find out who sent this.  Grab Batista and get over to that hotel.  Batista's still working on the explosion at the smack lab.  Morgan, put the cake down.  You're with me.  A jar of blood   Dramatic, cryptic, playful.  Could it be him? Got an extra key from the manager.  Said the same thing as the front desk clerk.  The guy who checked into 103 was white and normal looking.  I haven't seen a single security camera since we've been here.  It's likely this guy scouted hotels and chose one with lax security.  Better be ready to cancel your lunch.  Police.  Open up.  Oh, my God.  Jesus.  Get back in your room.  Metro dispatch, this is 3 Henry 8 8 out at the Marina View hotel.  I need uniformed backup, forensics.  Fuck it.  Just send everybody out.  It's been a while since we went prophylactic.  Not me.  Last night, I met this chick   I'll stop you right there, Vince.  So, they tell you anything about what's inside? No one's been inside.  Too much blood.  Dexter.  Just a heads up   It's bad in there.  Okay.    I'm serious.    Okay.  She's not kidding.  It's your wet dream in there.  Okay.  You're going in first alone.  Get a sense of what we're dealing with and give me a report.  Don't fuck up.  Now I'm really curious.  He's been gone so long, he had to be planning a splashy return, but a crime scene just for me? Mommy! Tell me you found something, Morgan.  I talked to the guests in room 105.  They didn't see anyone go in or out.  What about across the hall? German tourists.  They got their head up their lederhosen.  They said they heard a whirring sound but thought someone was mixing margaritas or vacuuming.  Oh, my god! Hey.  Hey, you okay? I'm just a little queasy.  I fell down in there.  Never should have skipped breakfast.  Bullshit.  You're shaking.  What the hell happened up there? No, I'm okay.  I just need a little air.  Something finally got to you.  I guess you're human after all.  Cut him some slack, all right? I hate to disappoint you, I think it's just low blood sugar.  Tell us what you saw, Dex.  How many dead? A lot.  But no bodies, just blood   Maybe half a dozen dead.  I don't know.  You're saying there was a mass murder in there,   but they took the bodies?   How is that possible? There's one elevator, emergency stairs with alarms.  Someone would have seen corpses coming out.  I don't fucking know.  Hey, Dexter, you all right?   I can't go back in there.    You don't have to.  Fine.  Just get yourself cleaned up and   I don't know   Work from the hallway or something.  You're in room 422.  Elevators are to your right, and Bobby will see to your bags.  Dade county sheriff's department.  I'm looking for Rita Bennett.  That's me.  Did you find Paul?   I'm sorry?   Paul Bennett.  My ex husband attacked me last night.  My boyfriend filed a police report.  The only report we have is the one that Mr.  Bennett filed.  What? Wait.  Paul filed a police report? For what? Assault.  Your ex husband was just released from Baptist Memorial hospital.  He's pressing charges against you.  He attacked me! Not according to him.  All right.  Can we talk about this later? We need a formal statement.  You're gonna have to come with us right now to the station.  Fine.  Hey, make sure you label the section of the grid each blood sample came from.  All right? Sweet.  You should really get in here, Dex.  I never seen anything like this.  Wait till you've seen a few more Columbian drug busts.  Dude, I got misting up the walls, across the ceiling, but no tissue.  Come see.  Photos, Vince.  Hey, and how come the blood's not clotting? The blood's not clotting? No.  Genuine medical mystery.  Just keep getting samples.  I'll test it at the lab.  Hello? Don't hang up.  Dexter, I'm at the sheriff's station.  Paul's pressing assault charges against me.  How's it even possible? I was defending myself.  Just stay calm.  I know a lawyer.  I'll straighten it out.  I am calm.  They're the hysterical ones.  They're charging me with a class 2 felony.  Hello, Dexter? Are you there? Yeah, I'm right here.  This is ridiculous.  I could lose my job.  I could lose my kids.  I won't let that happen.  Well, I'm glad you're so confident.  Rita, just trust me.  I know how the system works.  Look, I'm at a crime scene right now, and I have to go, but I'll talk to my lawyer friend right away.    You okay?   Yeah.  Yeah, I'm okay.    Thank you.    Yeah, bye.  Is there a wall socket in there? Check it out.    What? A wall socket?   Yeah.  Of course there's a wall socket.  There's lots of wall   Hey, you're right.  There was something plugged in here   probably a power tool to cut them up.  Come take a look.  Photos, Vince.  Lots and lots of photos.  Open Sesame.  Blood samples for the fridge.  And you better make room.  There's a lot more coming.  Shooters at the Bel Canto tonight.  You in? I'm not in the mood.  Angel, you're on the market, and the Bel Canto is hottie central.  Look at this.  They were for Nina's birthday   backstage passes to Neil Diamond.  You're in worse shape than I thought.    Oh, hi.    Hi.  Oh, Masuka was looking for you.  Something about drinks at the Bel Canto.  Yeah, I told him I had a yeast infection.  A bit of an overshare.  You want to talk about what happened today? Already did.  Dexter, the last time I saw you like that was when dad died.  Can talk to me, you know? Just got to open your mouth and move it.  I'll call Rudy.  I'll tell him I'll be late.  Deb, seriously.  I puked.  I'm fine.  I know you want to help, but unless you have breath mints, there's nothing to do.  Why do you always do this?   Do what?   You shut me out! Like your birth father that lived up the highway your whole life and never tried to contact you.  I still don't know how that makes you feel.  I'll tell you what, if some random emotion strikes me in the middle of the night, you'll be the first one I call.  Fine.  Whatever.  Did Paul force his way into the house? N o.  Did you ask him to leave? Yes, and he refused.  But in your statement, it says you invited your ex husband into your bedroom.  He was drunk, and the kids were asleep, and I knew exactly where this was heading   Cracked ribs and a broken jaw.  And you didn't want it to escalate.  I understand that, but we can't prove intent.  Your ex husband has the injuries here, not you.  Paul has a record of spousal abuse.  Spousal abuse can be mutual.  It was never mutual.  Okay.  But the man is a model parolee.  His drug tests are clean.  He's got glowing reports from the court appointed supervisor.  Corrections will want to see this guy transition.  I don't care! He's not going near my children.  Do you understand? Rita, if you deny him visitation, you could lose your children.  Now, you have deposition in two days.  Do not give this man any more ammunition than he already has.  Okay.  Damn.  Just blood? What happened to the bodies? Hell if I know.  I don't want to know.  Blood was bad enough.  No wonder you seem so amped.  Your brother must have loved it.    Fuck no.  He freaked.    Really? I thought, you know, blood was his thing.  What happened? I don' know.  It was like usual.  He shut me out.    Did he say anything?   Let's not talk about Dex right now.  Was it like a panic attack? I don't know.  He's not really big into sharing his feelings, in case you hadn't noticed.  Kiss me.  What's the matter? You don't even have wood.  Well, you're the one that said you wanted to talk.  Yeah, but not now.  I'm horny.  Maybe I should call him.  Are you fucking kidding me? What? We   We bonded last weekend.  Isn't that what boyfriends are supposed to do, show some interest in the family? Yeah, but not when his girlfriend's trying to get into his pants.  Deb, that's not fair.  You take me out on a   couples' weekend to get to know your brother, and then you punish me for giving a damn? I mean, your issues don't have to be mine.  You know what? Forget it.  Let's just go to sleep.  Okay.  I'm gonna go watch TV.  She loved him so goddamn much.  She took every one of his CDs in the separation.  She wouldn't even give me his Greatest Hits.  Nina loved Neil Diamond.  \"Song Sung Blue.  \" \"September Morn.  \" Oh, my god   \"Kentucky Woman.  \" You got to love that shit.  That's like the fourth chick you've driven off.  Waitress! Is there a waitress? I need a drink.  Waitress! Bro, you're a train wreck.  Look, you got to stop talking about the divorce.  I ain't ashamed.  Yeah, I think that's clear, but it's pathetic.  Look Don't talk about the divorce unless they ask.  Comprendo?   Eighty six the ring.    I have to take a squirt.  She's gonna fuck me silly.  My sister's right.  I don't share my problems with her Or with anybody.  Harry taught me that   Secrecy, self reliance, and a well stocked cupboard of hefty bags.  Fortunately, I've never met a problem I can't manage Until that boy in the blood.  He scares me.  I want him to go away.  You awake? What? Are you sure you locked the door? Yeah, I'm positive   Bolt and chain.  What am I gonna do? Don't worry.  I'll figure it out.  And I will.  I can always see other people's problems more clearly than my own.  Fortunately, Rita's has a name.  Everyone who set foot on the bloody carpet in room 103 left a footprint, and since we do shoe molds of everyone on personnel, that leaves only one set of footprints unaccounted for   The killer's.  This shows everywhere he went in the room.    The question is why.    Hold on.  Aren't we missing something? Where are the victims' footprints? Give that lady a lollipop.  Are you suggesting there were never any bodies in room 103? Why would a guy stage a massacre and not have any bodies? And where'd he get the blood? I've just got a preliminary blood report.  The blood in that room came from at least 5 different bodies, possibly more.  My fellow traveler had five victims.  Ice truck killer had 5 victims.  I always wondered what he did with the blood.  Wait, wait.  The ice truck killer did not horde his victims' blood just to have a party at the motherfucking Marina View hotel.  Why would he do that? To chase me down the rabbit hole.  What was that, Morgan? I didn't say anything.  I'll remind you people   We arrested the ice truck killer.  His name is Neil Perry, and he's awaiting trial in county.  Bullshit.  Neil Perry recanted his confession.  He's a fraud.    Try telling that to the capital.    I did.  Do we have any more evidence to support this theory? When Masuka noticed the blood wasn't clotting, I ran some tests, and it was loaded with Coumadin and heparin.  One's an anticoagulant.  The other's a preservative.  It means the blood's old.  Plus the blood spatters' all impact and castoff.  There are no hand transfers or swipe patterns to indicate the presence of any actual victims.  Masuka, run the DNA on all five vics and see if it matches the ice truck killer's victims.  You two get out to the Marina View hotel.  Retrace his steps.  Maybe it'll tell us something.  And not a word to anyone about the ice truck killer.  All right, Astor, just stand up straight.  Now, do you have the emergency phone number list? It's in my backpack.  Do I have to show it to you again? Just promise me you won't let your brother out of your sight.  Rita? You're scaring them.  Yeah, well, they should be.  I didn't tell them what Paul did the other night.  What'd you say when you dragged them to the neighbors'? I smelled gas.  I should have just thrown them in the car and headed out of state, gone back to Michigan.  Remember what the lawyer said.  You don't want to do anything rash.  Just relax.  The court supervisor will be there the whole time.  Hey, buddy.  Come on.  Where's the love? Come on.  Daddy, what happened? Oh, nothing, buddy.  Just a little bump on the head.  That's it.  Hey, we're going to the circus.  We're going to the circus, 'cause daddy always keeps his promises, remember? Good.  All right.  Ready? Got your stuff? Let's go.  You okay? I prefer the enchanting Rita over the worried one.  If I can figure out a way to make her ex husband my problem, I can help her sleep much easier tonight.  All I need is a little proof of his inner monster.  Harry would have insisted on that.  Harry didn't believe in preemptive killing, but maybe I can bend the rules just this once.  After all, Harry wasn't perfect.  He lied about my birth father.  The trifecta   Weapon, ammo, and impaired judgment.  Throw in a little domestic violence, and you have the perfect recipe for a family slaughter.  Mommy! Hide your head, Dexter.  Close your eyes.  No! So, after he soaked the room in blood, he crossed to the desk And then over to the bedside table.  There's a clock radio and some smeared blood.  Maybe he turned it on.  No, we're missing something.  Let's go over it again.  We've been over it three times! Well, maybe the map's wrong.  Call your brother.  What? Why is everybody's first move to call Dexter? You don't even like him.  What'd the freak do this time, boil your goldfish? No, it's just It's Rudy.  We had our first fight.  Tiff.  I don't know.  Whatever you want to call it.  I thought we were talking about your brother.  We were.  And we'll be back with Billy Joel, the Eurythmics, and Devo on 103 fm,   hits from the '80s.    Turn that off.  No, wait.  I want to hear it.  It's Devo.  Turn that shit off.  He said 103 fm.  This is room 103.  Leviticus 10:3.    10:3  103.    Son of a bitch.  You think he's trying to tell us something? \"I will be sanctified in them that come nigh me, \"and before all people, \"I will be glorified.  \" Hey.  Hey.  Deb's pissed at me.  I need advice.  So you came here? You know you know her better than anyone.  Come on.  I got two porterhouses and a sixer of microbrew.  Well, one minute we're talking about her day, you know, the whole bloodbath thing.  Right.  And the next, she wants to jump my bones.  I mean, Deb's hot and all, but sprinkle in a little conversation once in a while, you know? She's my sister.  I don't know.  Can I help you find something? You wouldn't happen to have a good meat knife.  Thanks.  Anyway, the other half of the argument was about you.  Me? Yeah.  It was already tense enough, but when I brought your name, she lost it.  So, what do I do? Tell her it's all your fault.    Seriously?   You will eventually.  Deb has a way of wearing you down.  Just start from there.  It's easier.  I got to take this.  You mind if I? Hey.  Where are you? Still at work, chasing a lead.  Let me guess   The bloodbath case.  I don't want to talk shop right now.  Baby, I am so sorry.  You were totally right.  I was mad at Dexter, and I took it out on you.  My shift's almost done.  You want to come over and talk? I'd love to, babe, but I'm about to eat dinner with Dexter.  Well, after.  Yeah, but here's the thing.  I think I'm gonna sleep at my place tonight.  I mean, it's closer, and I'm drinking, you know.  You understand, right? Yeah.  I'll call you tomorrow.    Care to dance?   You dance to this? A bit.  What about your wife? Tan line on your ring finger.  Well, um I'm not gonna talk about that tonight.  Divorced? I get it.  Mine was just finalized.  Let's go.  Will you excuse me? Excuse me.  Police.  I need to talk to you.  I'm not a hooker anymore.  I work for a legitimate escort service now.  I'm not here to bust anyone.  I just need to know why you paint your nails the way you do.  He was a real good client.  You want to spend the night in a cell? All right.  About a year ago, there was this guy.    Guy or client?   A john, okay? That's when I worked Calle Ocho.  Anyway, he started getting all rough with me until he saw this.  Then what? Then he changed his tune, got all turned on.  Told me to take my fake hand off.  He started doing some kinky, weird stuff, like he was worshipping it.  To cap it off, he takes all my nail polish and paints each nail a different color.  I liked it, so I kept doing it.  You know that guy on the news they arrested for the ice truck killings? Yeah, the one who stuffs roadkill?   Is that the guy?   No way.  My trick, he's sexy.    A freak, but sexy.    Okay.  From the beginning and with more detail.  Well, thanks for the hospitality.  Hey, thanks for the steaks.  You know, I didn't get a chance to ask.  Deb mentioned that you had a little   incident at the crime scene.  Did she? Well, most of my prosthetic clients are pretty traumatized by the time they get to me.  Anyway, I'm a good listener if you ever want to talk.  Thanks, but unless you know an expert in   repressed memories For real? You know something about it? More than I ever wanted to.  When I was in high school, I started having these dreams of a woman hit by a truck.  Who was she? I didn't know.  Then one day I stopped by a mailbox, and it all came crashing back My mom getting out to mail a letter, me still in the car.  I watched her die.  How old were you? I didn't remember anything till I   went and mailed a letter.  Walked right into the belly of the beast without knowing it.  What kind of memories are you having? They're still a little vague.  Right.  Well, you're gonna have to face it eventually.  Maybe next time.  When you see Deb, go with white roses.  They're her favorite.  That's a good tip.  It's funny how life brings people together, huh? Rudy misunderstands my problem.  I want the boy and blood to go away, not come crashing back.  Fortunately, I have other people's problems to focus on right now.  Like forgotten cellphones.  What do you got? Well, so far we're chasing a ghost.  Couple of employees helped with the sketch, but it's pretty generic.  Only real lead we have is a couple of numbers he set at the crime scene.  Screw the numbers.  Who was killed? Where are the bodies? I heard some pretty wild theories out there.  Just theories.  We're still waiting for full blood results.  Damn it, Maria, you're stalling.  I'm just trying to avoid speculation.  Well, you got to give me something and soon.  This department can't afford another public relations disaster.  Well Maybe you should tell the D. A.  to let Neil Perry go.  He's not the ice truck killer.  Are you still hung up   I can't believe this.  Jesus, Maria, that's not gonna happen.  The D. A.  takes his cues from us.  If you just tell him you made a mistake Not going to happen.  Now let it go.  First break in this case, you come straight to me.  This may be a shot in the dark, but I met this hooker last night.  Going with a pro   Now, that's how you get over the ex.  No, that's not what I mean.  So you didn't fuck her.  But she blew you, right? Would you shut up? It was a lead.  On what? I'll let you know if it pans out, but what do you know about amputee fetishes? Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I know, it's it's called acrotomophilia.  But don't let them hear you call it that.  It sounds like a disease.  No, they prefer to be known as \"devotees.  \" I knew you were the man to ask.  Not really.  I prefer a girl with a kung fu grip.  You know who you should talk to? It's What's his face   Deb's boyfriend.  Prosthetics guys deal with devotees all the time.  Thanks.  No memory flashes here.  No little lost boy in blood.  Maybe he went back to hiding in the dormant reaches of my cerebral cortex.  Here's to hoping.    Yo, Dex.    Hey.  So, this is what you do for a living? I'm trying to match castoff patterns from a crime scene.  A power tool was used.  Here you go.  Oh, thanks.  Circular saw.  Seems like there'd be an easier way to make a mess like this.  Yeah, trust me.  I know.  I've been in here for hours.  You know, in my line of work, you hear all sorts of horror stories   boat propellers, garbage disposals.  It seems like something you'd see with a chainsaw.  Yeah, I hear that.  But this power tool was plugged into a socket.  Guess you haven't heard of an electric chainsaw.  Come on, people.  We're coming up empty.  Those numbers mean something.  1 0 3.  We need to find the connection, and until we do, you need to go over every page of every police report you wrote in the last six months.  Think.  Bus station locker, piece of a bank account, area code, partial license plate.  What is it? I want answers.  What are you doing here? How do you always do it? Do what? Make me feel like I'm 6 years old all the time.  If this is about Rudy, he was just picking up his cellphone.  Where'd he leave it? My apartment.  What was he doing there?   Uh eating steaks.    And? Uh I don't know.  Drinking beer.  And?   Debra.    And?   Talking?   Talking.  You talked.  You opened your mouth, and sounds came out.  On the same night that I wanted to talk to you, but you shut me out.    Oh.    Yeah, \"oh.  \" You don't talk to me, Dex.  You've spent our entire lives keeping me at a distance.  But my boyfriend shows up on your doorstep   with a couple of T bones     They were porterhouses.  Porterhouses, and you end up tossing beers back into the middle of the night.  Dex, you are all the family that I have, and I barely know you.  So, if you're gonna eat steaks with somebody after a rough day, if somebody's gonna break through your fucking walls, I think it should be me.  I think I have earned it.  I'm late for Rita's deposition.  Deb, it's hard for me.  You know that.  You Rudy Cooper? Angel Batista.  I work with your girlfriend, Debra.  Oh, hi.  Nice to meet you.  I'd like to ask you a few questions, if you don't mind.  Sure.  Let me just grab the door.  So, does this have to do with a case? You could say that.  Well, fire away.  Well, I ran into this lady with a prosthetic hand   Call girl, actually.  Said she had a very unique client, an amputee devotee.  You have a lead on this client? That's the bitch of it.  I don't have a goddamned clue, except for the freaky sex stuff.  I was hoping that you could steer me toward some of those weirdos.  I'm afraid I got into this business to help people get better, not help people get off.  Yeah, I'm sure Debra will be happy to hear that.  But I can talk to some of my colleagues, see if I can draw up a list of contacts for you.  That'd be great.  How often does someone get a chance to help catch a bad guy, huh? You in a rush for this information? No, no, I'm good.  I'm chasing a long shot, really.  Well, just give me a call at the station when you got something.  Will do.  Good to meet you.  Good to meet you.  Last question.  According to your ex husband, you left town with your boyfriend last weekend.  That's right.  His father died.  Did your ex husband have a scheduled visitation with his children during that time? I told Paul I'd make it up to him.  So, then he gave you permission? No.  I'm the one that gave him visitation in the first place.  I'm the custodial parent.  I didn't have to do that.    Could you give us a second?   Yes, of course.  Why didn't you tell me you broke your visitation agreement? I didn't know it was a big deal.  I think she's answered that last question, so unless there's something else No, that's fine.  If I missed anything, we'll get to it at the psychiatric evaluation next Wednesday.  Nobody told me about any psychiatric evaluation.  It's mandatory in these cases.  The psych test determines if there's a competency hearing.  For me? But he's the ex con.  It's standard.  Rita, you should be fine.  Should be? You mean she could actually lose this? Guys I'm handcuffed here.  You violated a custody agreement.  You struck your ex husband in your bedroom.  He has a case.  Mama, look at my henna tattoo.    So, how much candy have you had?   Lots.  Thanks.    Now she'll never get to sleep.    She'll calm down soon.  This one's already crashed.  Mom, can my dad read me a story? I don't think so, honey.  Please? Okay.  But just one.  Put your duds on, buddy   Spider man ones I bought you.  I'll get him ready.  You've got 20 minutes left.  Thanks, Betty.  Thank you.  Hey, Rita.  It doesn't have to be this way.  I mean, we can make this easier on each other, right? I could drop the charges if you agree to unsupervised visitation.  Fuck you.  Hey, Dexy.  You know, I don't think your girlfriend appreciates the gravity of the situation.  If she loses that case, she could lose the kids.    That won't happen.    Never say \"won't.  \" We live in a world of wills   Wills and wonders.  That's what I'm trying to teach my children.  And they are my children, too, something she seems to forget.  Okay, so I made some mistakes, but I learned from it, right? Hey, I'm sober.  Look.  No needle marks.  I got the fucking Alaskan pipeline running through these veins, and all because of those   two little s of love in the next room.  My heart beats for those two kids, so if you or that skinny bitch try to screw with what's mine, I swear to God, I don't care who I have to hurt   Harry's first rule was don't get emotionally involved.  I think this is why.  Astor, go brush your teeth.  Someone once said it's easier dealing with other people's problems than your own.  They were wrong.  Paul? Dexter? Where were you? Taking out the trash.  Did you see Paul? When I was in the side yard, I heard the front door open.  Hey, my dad's car is gone.  Let's face it, Paul.  You've been a problem.  It's time for you to go away.  The ice truck killer case has been reopened.  Officially.  We have new forensic evidence that shows that the DNA from the blood at the Marina View hotel matches the DNA from his victims.  What about Neil Perry? Isn't he supposed to be the ice truck killer? All those questions should be directed to captain Matthews.  He's been personally handling the Perry case.  Oh, shit.  I hope she told the Captain.  Who knew? Who knew about this? This is the first we're hearing about it, Captain.  The ice truck killer is still at large.  Sure.  I'll call you back.  You overplayed your hand, Maria.  I gave you a chance to make it right.    I told you     You don't tell me shit! This is my department.  I made you lieutenant.  Me.  You were just another spik detective.  Nice, Tom.  Real nice.  Your true colors finally come out.  Oh, no.  No, you haven't seen my true colors, Maria.  But you're about to.  Enjoy this office while it's still yours.  Thank you.  Dexter.  What happened? What's wrong? It's Paul.  I don't know all the details, but he   violated Florida's three strikes law.  He's back in jail.  It is truly amazing the things you can do when you put your mind to it.    What's so funny, mom?   Yeah, why are you laughing? No problem is insurmountable.  Not when you have the most accessible evidence locker in Miami.  Paul did need to go away.  This is the police.    Sir, you're going to have to turn down the television.    But death wasn't the answer.  Police.  Open up.    We're coming in, Mr.  Bennett.    Life in prison will do just fine.  For now, at least, the code of Harry remains unbroken.  Hey, get over here.  You're part of this family, too.  I need an ambulance at 1228 Caldon Street.  A guy's been stabbed.  Stay with us.  Hang in there, okay? Keep looking at us.  Heard they're dropping ice truck murder charges on Neil Perry.  Yeah, I'm sure he'll be filing a lawsuit any minute now.  More shit for us to deal with.  Speaking of which, watch out for reporters out there.  They're still waiting on a comment from the Captain.  So, things still rocky at home? Oh, with Rudy? Yeah.  I'm not calling until he apologizes.  I'm done being second choice.  Good for you, Morgan.  If you're not doing anything tonight, Masuka's invited us to the Bel Canto.  For you.  It's too late.  You blew it.  I did blow it.  This is the first chance I've had to talk.  I'm too tired to talk.  Well let's go home, fall into bed.  Why, Rudy? I mean, fucking why? You didn't want to fall into bed the other night when I laid my heart out on the phone.  You wanted to talk to my brother.  I was confused.  Well, I'm not confused.  That's the problem, I know what I want.  I was confused because I love you.  What I want is very simple and uncomplicated.  What did you say? I love you.  Don't try to Fuck.  What? I love you, too.  What happened to your lip? I'm just, uh incident with a tool at the workshop.  Well, let's get you home and take care of it.  So, this is doom.  I've been the architect of so much of it.  It's only fair I should know what all the fuss is all about.  He left me this room for a reason.  Five women gave their blood, their lives for this moment.  There's only one way to find out why.  Close your eyes, Dexter.  I want mama.  No! Not in front of my baby! Oh, god.  Please don't cry.  It's gonna be okay.  Don't you dare! Not in front of my baby! No! Close your eyes, Dexter.  Don't look.  Dexter.  Close your eyes.  I want mama! Mommy loves you, Dexter.      Previous EpisodeNext Episode"

You've been a problem.  It's time for you to go away.  It's Paul.  He He violated Florida's three strikes law.  The cops picked him up totally strung out on heroin.  He's back in jail.  Holy shit! They're fucking fingertips.  He started getting all rough with me until he saw this.  Then what? Then he changed his tune, got all turned on.  Told me to take my fake hand off.  He takes all my nail polish and paints each nail a different color.    Menthol?   Like cough drops.  I could hear them clicking against his teeth when he Son of a bitch loved those fucking lozenges.  I was confused because I love you.  What did you say? I love you.  I love you, too.  What happened to your lip? No, it's   I had an incident with a tool at the workshop.  I need an ambulance at A guy's been stabbed.  I've never had much use for the concept of hell, but if hell exists, I'm in it.  The same images running through my head over and over.  I was there.  I saw my mother's death.  A buried memory, forgotten all these years.  It climbed inside me that day.  And it's been with me ever since   My dark passenger.  You should be focusing on me, socio.  Seriously want to get the motherfucker that did this to Batista.  You all right? Yeah.  I'm okay.  I'm just, you know, distraught about Angel.  How's he doing? Do we know? Still in surgery.  Laguerta's there.  God, I hate feeling so helpless.  What, no jokes about providing gross sexual comfort in a time of crisis? Our friend was stabbed And he might die.  Officer Morgan.  What do you think, Dex? He put up a fight.  There was a struggle.  Attaboy, Angel.  Here, this trail   Steady stream of drops.  He had a few seconds.  Tried to move away until   till he fell.  So much blood.  What's happening to me? No way.  You're the one I'm supposed to meet.  In the flesh.  You know, I was just talking to someone about you.  That tickles.  Don't stop.  I wouldn't dream of stopping.  You're so different this time   Gentle.  Are you gonna try and get all pervy with my stump again? Actually, your imperfection is what saved you the first time.  Saved me from what? True artistry.  The message of my work is   not in the product itself, but rather the presentation.  That wrinkled flesh on your radial carpal joint is far from perfect.  It's quite unsightly, actually.  Hey, you don't have to be an asshole about it.  Hey, hey, no, no, no.  Shh, shh, shh.  I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to offend.  Truthfully I'm thankful for you.  You're my escape plan.  Escape from what? The police.  Because of you, I've had to speed up my project.  I need something to distract them by.  And I always found a freshly chopped up body always does the trick.  Wait, wait! No! Don't struggle.  That never helps.  I'm compressing your carotid artery, and that is cutting off oxygen to your brain.  In about 10 seconds, you'll be unconscious.  Hey, it's Rudy.  Leave a message.  Okay, I guess you went to bed.  Or you fell asleep on the couch watching \"Xena\" reruns, which I still think makes you a dork.  Either way, call me when you get this, okay? Miss you.  He's still in surgery, but I don't know when we'll hear anything.  So I guess you won't be coming over tonight.  No.  I mean, I can't.  Alright.  I understand.  You need to be there for your friend.  I haven't told the kids yet.  Told them about Angel? No, about Paul Being back in prison? I hate breaking their hearts.  They think so much of their dad now.  Right.  You know what? Focus on Angel.  We can talk about this later.  Thanks.  They're actually coming out right now.  I got to go.  Angel sustained severe internal injuries.  He lost a lot of blood.  But the surgery was successful.  It looks like our boy's out of the woods.  I know I should stay, be a part of the group hug.  But I can't focus.  I'm trapped in the clutches of a memory.  I need to know what it means.  Morgan.  What the fuck is wrong with you? I have someplace I have to be.  Well, we all got someplace to be.  But you just found out that somebody who was supposed to be your friend is gonna live.  Does that make you feel anything? Anything at all? Take your fucking hand off me.  Just what I always thought.  Right.  * Deck the halls with parts of bodies * * La da da da dum * Shit.  Just what I need.    Hey.    I know it's late.  I guess you didn't get my message.  I drove by and saw your car.  I can go.  Get your ass in here.  It's about time you see where I live anyway.  You have no idea how much I needed this.  You feel good.  And cold.  You're freezing! Well, then stay and keep me warm.  This Batista thing has gotten to you, hasn't it? Angel's daughter was there.  That's got to be rough.  Daughter of a cop   Just like you.  Yeah.  I remember what that's like   Kissing your father goodbye, always afraid it's for the last time.  Let's get out of town for the weekend   Just the two of us.  We need to talk.  I'm sitting right here.  Nope.  The time has got to be right.  Okay.  It'll have to wait At least till we catch the asshole who did this to Batista.  Let me warn you   I can be very persistent.  I need to get out of town, and I need you to come with me.  What I need is sleep, which is not gonna be easy.  I'm totally wired from all this shit.  Well, lucky for you, I have the perfect cure.  My loving arms.  And I got a little thing to help you sleep.  That ain't no little thing.  I meant Valium.  It's one of the perks working at the hospital.  Wine and Valium? I'll be totally helpless.  You read my mind.  Well, as I live and breathe! You miss me? You and the bear claws you're hiding behind your back.  This must be important.  Haven't seen much of you lately.  No rest for the wicked.  How's Gene? Good days and bad.  He just finished his first round of radiation.  Well, he's a good guy.  Not much of a bridge player, though.  Harry and Gene used to get so mad every time Doris and I would take them to the cleaners.  I was hoping you could dig up an old case file for me.  Well, sure thing.  Got a date? Not exactly.  It's the crime scene where Harry found me.  I wish I could help, but everything from that long ago is boxed up in the basement at City Hall.  And as you can see, I'm up to my you know what in year end reports, so It's my lieutenant.  Camilla, is there anything you remember? What I remember, Dexter Morgan, is your father caring enough to bring you into his home and give you a loving family.  I wouldn't keep your lieutenant waiting.  Who found the body parts? I did.  They were left under the tree.  I thought it was the crew from last night just messing around Till I found the head.  I told him not to touch anything, but he never listens.  God, Patty, you're such a bitch.  Did you guys see anything out of the ordinary before you found the body? There were some broken ornaments by the tree.  Who could do something like this so close to Christmas? The Grinch.  Oh, you're a fucking riot, Max! Like anyone's gonna go shopping down here after this.    There go our jobs.    Thank you for your cooperation.  Oh, sucks to be an elf.  Get some visual surveillance.  I got here as fast as I could.  What are we looking at? Female victim.  Cut up into pieces.  The ice truck killer? So soon? Yep.  And after the bloodbath at the hotel, can't wait to see how the captain's gonna handle the press on this one.    James!   Yeah? I need you to walk Dexter to the crime scene.  And will somebody turn off this goddamn snow machine?! Your sister can help you out.  That a whole sexual tension thing or am I missing something? It's the same numbers he left at Marina View hotel.  Any leads as to what they mean? We've talked to numerologists, mathematicians, code breakers   Nothing.  They need more to go on.  First he turns my whole world inside out with a carnival of blood.  Now he leaves me this   A calming oasis in the desert of my confusion.  It doesn't make sense.  Crime scene's wiped clean.  Another hooker? Ho, ho, ho   Another dead ho.  Somebody's been naughty.  Hey, Morgan.  Want to sit on my lap when we're done and tell me what you want for Christmas? And he's back! No, thanks.  Last thing on my wish list is a burning sensation when I pee.  This doesn't seem right.  Body parts scattered among the presents.  Broken ornaments.  It's not his usual meticulous style.  It seems rushed Haphazard.  That would explain why we can't find one of the hands.  What's wrong? There's something underneath the torso.  Merry Christmas, Miami.  After all this time, why do you think the ice truck killer has struck again? Any answer at this time would be pure speculation on my part.  Do you think it has any connection with your department's handling of the Neil Perry fiasco? Sir? \"You've arrested the wrong man.  \"Made the world think I'm a rank amateur, \"and I'm very, very angry \"to answer for your mistakes.  \" Stop the tape.  What are you doing? Look at her tears.  They're rolling up.  Oh, my God.  Bastard's got her upside down.  That's how he bleeds them out.  He strings them up like meat.  Please.  No, please, no   All right, turn it off.  I'll have the tape sent to the station for analysis.  Sergeant Doakes, you're on point.  With all due respect, sir, lieutenant Laguerta's in charge of this investigation.  Not anymore.  The fact is we haven't been able to catch this guy, and now he's rubbing our noses in it.  We've got to come up with some fresh ideas.  This is some bullshit.  I'll go talk to him.  No, no, no.  Do as he says.  The commissioner has his ass in a sling.  He's up for review.  Word is he's getting the boot.  So you're just gonna sit back and take this? Well, if it means being seen as his worthy successor I'll be at the hospital.  All right, P. B.  and J.  inside, cut diagonally, not straight across.  Tastes better that way.  Has dad said if he's coming over Christmas eve or Christmas morning? I miss him.  Well, I'm afraid your dad's not gonna make it this year for the holidays.  Where is he? Well, uh he's   He's back in jail, isn't he? Look, I know he wanted to say goodbye, but there wasn't any time.  He loves you guys so much.  I forgot my math book.  I'm   I'm sure he'd love to hear from you.  We could write him a letter.  It's all your fault.  You could at least pretend you want to be here.  You're the one who had the urgent need for tacos.  Yeah, so we could talk about Rudy.  He's been acting weird lately.  Last night he said we need to talk.  Well, that's never good.  Well, thanks.  I feel a lot better.  I've only been obsessing about this all day.  Think you could talk to him for me? Look, it's Rudy.  I sort of called him.  Dex, Deb didn't tell me you'd be joining us.  Apparently she's had a lot on her mind.  Oh, shit.  That's work.  I have to go.  Here, take mine.  Sorry.  What's with your lip? Deb catch you with a right hook? She can be pretty protective with the remote.  I had a little workshop accident this morning.  Doesn't look like it happened this morning.  The cut's already closing up.  Did I say  I meant yesterday morning.  I think I'm working too hard.  Anyway, I don't think my lip is why Deb arranged this little chitchat.  My sister is afraid there may be trouble in paradise.  Your sister's wrong.  So this whole \"need to talk\" thing? I'm starting to look at the big picture.  She's someone that I could see spending the rest of my life with, you know? No, I don't know.  But I do know that Deb's falling for you Hard.  You hurt her   And you'll hurt me.    Something like that.  Angel, se recupera.  Angel va a estar en la casa para la Navidad.  Okay? El es un hombre fuerte y strong.  Y adem\u00e1s I'm tired of hearing you two gallinas cluck.  Hey, you.  You had us so worried.  If I'd have known that this would get you back in the same room with me, I would have gotten stabbed sooner.  I'm gonna get the doctor.  No, no, no.  What are you doing? No, dejalo.  The doctor said you're lucky to be alive and still have a liver.  That's why I got two, right? It's a good thing you decided to be a cop.  Tell me that you caught the cocksucker that ruined one of my best shirts.  We don't have any leads.  Did you see anything? No.  He was behind me.  I just felt the blade go in.  It happened so fast.  Maria How long has Nina been here? She was the first one at the hospital.  She's been with you the whole time.  Yo no s\u00e9 porque, pero My mother was murdered before my eyes.  Makes sense I'd choose a life where I search for meaning in blood.  The sole memory I have of her is being covered in it.  I need to know more details.  I hope that look means you found something on Batista's shirt.  You should see this.  That's what I drove all the way back from the hospital for? This drop of blood doesn't match the wound pattern or the spatter from the rest of Batista's shirt, and look where it is   On the inside of the back collar.  Angel is stabbed from behind.  You think it's the attacker's blood? We know Batista fought back.  Well, run the DNA.  If this guy's got priors, we'll get a hit on the database.  Already sent a sample to the lab.  All right, let's get this together.  Come on, let's go.  Sorry to hear You know, about Matthews taking you off the case.  Last gasp of a desperate man.  Things are gonna change around here.  And I won't forget your help.  \"And I'm very, very angry.  \" \"Oh, God, no! No, please!\" I can't watch this again.  I know it's tough, but just keep your eyes on the monitor.  Wait   What was that? The camera tilts up right before he hits the off switch.  Watch.  That, my friends, is a monster refrigeration unit.  He needs it cold to preserve the bodies.  We knew that.  But check this out.  Look how much space there is between her feet and the ceiling.  This room is way bigger than your standard commercial freezer.  Most likely it was a custom build.  So we should focus our search on commercial districts.  No.  Residential.  You think he built this in his own place? He picks up hookers, right? I worked Vice.  The smart girls know not to go near a factory or a warehouse unless you never want to be seen again.  How do we know he didn't knock out his victims or drug them, then take them back to a warehouse? None of the other victims showed any signs of head injury or narcotics.  Besides, what better way to trap a victim than to get her to walk into your own home? The escort service said she was meeting her client at the corner of Brickell Avenue and Coral Way.  And her body was found at Santa's cottage, which is on Biscayne mall.  We'll map out grids.  We'll focus on private residences drawing large amounts of power near those areas.  We catch a break We'll catch this son of a bitch.  Wait! Where the hell are you going? I need to do some research on a case.  You were supposed to call me after your lunch with Rudy.  I've been freaking out! He sent me this text message.  \"Cum sail away with me?\" He misspelled \"come.  \" Dexter.  This is no time to joke.  This is good, right? A romantic weekend? What did he say to you? Oh, wait, no.  Don't.  Don't tell me.  Maybe he wants it to be a surprise.  Unless I should know.  Should I know? Okay.  Tell me.  You know, no.  Don't.  \"We need to talk\"? Who says that unless you're getting dumped? I don't think that's what this is about.  He probably wants me out on the water in case I make a scene.  You know, I always do this.  I put myself out there.  I set myself up to get hurt.  He wants to be part of the family.  What? Wait.  Like Propose? I have to get to the library before it closes, but we'll talk about this later, okay? Oh, my God.  Oh, my God! I was never one to dwell on my past, always content to leave it a mystery.  No details   Just a blur of images rushing by.  But my friend out there wants to bring those memories into focus.  So do I.  This is it for the Metro News for 1972 through 1973.  The Tribune's archives 10/3? 1 0 3  Same as the hotel, same as Santa's cottage.  This is what he wanted me to find all along.  Close your eyes.  Don't look.  Laura Moser My mother.  No wonder I felt so disconnected my entire life.  If I did have emotions, I'd have to feel this.  October 3, 1973.  Laura Moser and three others found chopped up with a chain saw.  Apparently a drug dealer didn't appreciate Laura and her friends stealing his cocaine.  First officer on scene was Harry Morgan.  You've been busy.  A crime that big and yet there's no record of the case file at City Hall, that seems a bit odd.  Don't you think? It's a long time ago.  What is in that report that Harry didn't want me to see?! Why was there no mention in any of the newspapers about a 3 year old boy at the crime scene?! Camilla Damn it, I need to know.  I need that file.  I can't give you the file 'cause it no longer exists.  I destroyed it the day your adoption went through.  You did what? Made a promise to your father.  Why, to protect him? To protect you.  Harry had a code.  He'd never ask you to destroy evidence.  Your father was a decent man and an honest cop, but what he saw in that cargo container changed him.  You were left there for days, starving, in blood 2 inches thick.  Yeah! Dex! Cody's run away! Are you sure? Yeah, I've looked everywhere.  Well, call the police.  I'll be right there.  Okay.  Camilla I need to know the truth.  Kid Leave this one alone.  I can't sit here like this.  I should be out there doing something.  Rita, the police said you need to stay here in case Cody comes home.  The neighbors are helping.  We'll find him.  Yeah, but one squad car for all of Miami? What if some crazy person picked him up off the street? It's all my fault.  Honey, what are you talking about? I should have heard Cody get out of bed.  I'm his big sister.  Hey.  Hey, look at me.  It's not your fault, okay? Okay? Could you go get Dexter some water? God.  I should have seen this coming.  Cody was so upset with me when I told him that Paul was back in jail.  Paul.  Today's Thursday, right? Yeah.  I think I know where Cody might be.  Hey.  Need a push? Today's the day you meet daddy in the park, huh? He'll be here.  Oh, baby, I'm so sorry, but he's not coming back   not for a long time.  Look, we'll talk about this when we get home, okay? After all the lies Harry left for me to uncover, I'd love to run away, too.  He won't even look at me.  I'm not the one in jail, and yet I'm still the bad guy.  Well, you didn't tell them the truth About their father.  I told them Paul was back in jail.  Well, right, you told them where he is, but you didn't tell them who he is.  He's still the same   drug using, wife beating redneck he always was.  They should hear that.  You're not a parent.  You don't understand.  You do anything to protect your kids.  Rita, wake up.  You're not protecting them.  You're protecting Paul.  Well, I   I got to get them home.  Somebody's in a good mood.  The commissioner and the review board did not look happy this morning.  They've been in Matthews' office for two hours.  You thinking his ass is about three shades of red right now? I don't care what color it is as long as it's on its way out the door.  Tell me that did not just happen.  It's who you know and who you blow.  Probably picking their fucking tee time.  Maria, watch your back.  He's gonna be gunning for you now more than ever.  Let him try.  My man Juan, hook it up.  They didn't have \"Road and Track\" so That better be a bag of applesauce.  Okay, Juan, at this point, you should go save yourself.  Go.  You got to be kidding me! Two double meats? A man's got to eat.  You're so cute when you're annoyed.  You know, your mouth makes those little O's.  God damn it, Angel, do I look like I'm being fucking cute with you?   Well, not now you don't, no.    Why do you always do this   make light of things that matter? Okay, I'm sorry.  Okay? When I come home, I'll eat anything you want.  No jokes, no complaining   I promise.  When you come home? I thought the way things are going with us I thought you'd forgiven me.  Well, of course I forgive you.  I forgave you a long time ago.  Okay, so let's fix this.  This could be a second chance for us.  What? Look, you did what you did.  It was hard.  But it got us to face the truth.  We were miserable for years.  Do you really want to survive this and go right back to being unhappy? Maybe.  What if I do? Look, you will always be Jorge's father.  I will always care about you.  I'll always be here for you.  But our marriage is over.  Why, yes, by all means, Tom, please, come in.  Maria Let's you and me have a talk.  Congratulations on the review.  I hear it went well.  You must be thrilled.  But now, if you don't mind   Let me get right to the point.  All our mishaps these last few months   Failure to bring in the ice truck killer, mishandling of Tony Tucci Even Neil Perry   Neil Perry was your fuck up Not mine.  They're all the result of a bad command structure, and that's my failure.  Well I'm glad to hear you say that.  Takes a big man to admit his own mistakes.  So this morning, the commissioner gave me the go ahead to restructure the division.  Effective immediately, you will no longer serve as my lieutenant.  I'm sorry.  I know this must be difficult for you.  Please, it's ridiculous.  You really don't want to do this.  Because of your status in the Cuban community? I'm a fucking hero to this community! You think they're just gonna accept it? Your replacement has already been selected.  Her name is Esm\u00e9 Pascal, a transfer from fort Lauderdale   A real up and comer.  Pascal, the Haitian American? The one who got shot last year in the line of duty.  Turns out she's an actual hero.  You think I'm gonna stay quiet for this, you're out of your mind.  I did warn you, Maria.  I'm gonna need you to clear out this office tonight.  Expect a call from my union rep.  You want it, you'll always have a place in the bullpen   And my fucking lawyer, too! with all the other detectives.  This isn't fucking over, Tom! You goddamn son of a bitch! Oh, you got to be kidding me.  How are you? How the hell do I look? I can barely remember how I got here.  Look, there's something we need to discuss.  If you came for an apology, you wasted a tank of gas.  Sit.  I'm not finished.  Fuck you.  Astor and Cody are in the other room.  Jesus, you brought them here? Look, I know this will be difficult, but I need you to explain to them why you're in this place.  I have no fucking idea why I'm in this place! Fine.  Fine.  You want to be in denial? Go ahead.  You will never see your kids again.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Rita, wait, wait.  I fought so hard to win those kids back, especially Astor.  If they see me here like this, I'm gonna lose them forever.  Paul, the one good thing that came out of our marriage are those kids.  And I know you love them.  But if you want to have any kind of real relationship with them, it has to be with the father they have, not the father they wish they had.  Now, you cheated on me.  You broke my heart, you broke my bones, and I took it so those kids wouldn't have to.  But I am giving you the chance to make it all right.  But not for me, for them.  I wouldn't know what to say.  Tell them you're paying for your mistakes.  It's a valuable lesson.  It's one you never got.  So what's it gonna be? Okay.    Daddy!   Daddy! Hey! All right, this won't take long.  There was a drop of blood on the back of your shirt that wasn't yours, so I need to check the back of your head.  Just so long as it's only my head you're checking back there, bro.  How are things with you and Rita? Not so good, actually.  We kind of had words.  I think I really upset her.  That's rough, man.  Maybe I'm not the right person for her.  Some people are meant to be alone, right? Dex, socio, alone sucks.    Hijo de puta!   Sorry.  Teeth marks.  You definitely wounded this guy.  Good.  I hope I broke his fucking nose Or at least gave him a fat lip.  Angel, have you ever met Deb's boyfriend, Rudy Cooper? Yeah.  I went by his office a couple of days ago.  Nice guy.  Why? At lunch, Rudy said he'd hurt his lip that morning.  He was lying, and I was too distracted to care.  But he's got my full attention now.  Hey, you here tonight? Yeah, we're tits deep in the ice truck killer.  Might be onto something.  It's gonna be an all nighter.  So that text message you got from Rudy about going away with him   you're not gonna do that? Tragically, no.  I was all psyched to meet him at the Miami Beach marina but this bullpen's my home till we finish this.    Good.    Good? I'm working on a theory that Rudy was gonna propose, and now he can't   Why is that good? No, I meant good that you're making progress here.  Yeah.  We're getting closer.  Fingers crossed.  At least I know my sister is safe tonight, which gives me time to check out my own theory on Rudy.  We've defined the area for the residential search.  Good.  So we'll start canvassing tonight.  You take the   That him? Yeah, how'd you know? 'Cause you got that stupid ass grin on your face again.    Go ahead.  Answer it.    Okay.    Hey.    Hey, Supercop.  What's the word? I'm kind of in a thing right now.  Got it.  I'll be quick.  You never answered my text.  Do I have the pleasure of your company this weekend? Yeah, about that   Come on, Deb, it's only two days.  I know, I know.  It's just   We've had a major break in the ice truck killer case.  I promise, as soon as we catch this douchebag, you and I are gonna spend a whole week together in bed.  You are not gonna be able to get rid of me.  Okay, okay but     How about dinner?   Oh, my God, you are persistent.  Well, you got to eat, right? So why not eat dinner with me on this yacht I'm on? Where the hell did you get a yacht? I rented it.  I thought we'd have a nice couple days together, but we could still have a nice night.  And there is that thing we need to talk about Okay, well, maybe I can take an hour for dinner.  I can work with an hour.  I mean, a real hour, not one of your \"let's stretch this out till 2:00 a.  m.  you might as well stay and have sex\" hours.  Right.  Real hour.  No fakey hour.  Got it.  All right, I'll get out of here as fast as I can.  I'll see you soon.  Thinking Rudy attacked Batista doesn't make any sense.  He's a loving boyfriend.  He spends his life helping people in need.  He brought me steaks.  Well, that's just rude.  Why would loving and helpful Rudy need an industrial grade lock? And a security camera? How do I get his DNA now? At times like this, I wish the truth was more easily accessible, and less   ripe.  But Harry taught me to trust my gut.  \"People lie all the time,\" he said.  \"But your instinct will never fail you.  \" Some blood from a cut lip, perhaps? I believe your rule specifically prohibits such action.  Did you do all this? In fact   I did.  You like? I like.  I like so much that it makes what I have to tell you that much harder.  Oh, please tell me you're not leaving.  I'm sorry.  I hit traffic.  It took me 30 minutes to get here.  I have to turn around and go right back.  Oh, my God.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Wait! Well, you're sort of forcing my hand here.  I wanted to wait until we were out in the water, but Here it goes.  I know this seems fast But I feel   I feel that I waited my whole entire life for you.  And now that you're here, I don't want you to leave.  Debra Morgan Will you marry me? I knew it! I fucking knew it! Is that your version of a \"yes\"? Yes, yes, yes, yes, but   No, no, no! Stop at \"yes.  \" \"Yes\", I like that part.  Yes, but let's slow it down, you know? Like, let me savor this.  I want to be with you.  I want to enjoy it, you know? So it's a \"yes,\" but     Okay, I get it.    You do? No, not really, but I can work with it.  Good, good.  Oh, God, I can still wear the ring, right? Yes, but There's a condition.  I know you have to go to work, but If you're gonna wear the ring, we need to celebrate.  One glass of champagne.  That's all I ask.    Rudy, I     I mean it.  You can't leave your sort of fianc\u00e9 on a yacht with a cold meal and an unopened bottle of champagne.  It's kind of cruel.  Just one glass of champagne to celebrate.  And then you can go back, saving Miami from the ice truck killer.  I can live with that.  Hey, I need these two tested against each other.  It's kind of a rush.  Excuse me, hi.  Hey, these two   Tested against each other right now.  Okay.  It's Deb.  Do it.  Hey, I know you're working, but let me know when you come up for air.  I need to talk to you.  I'm in the building.  This yacht's amazing.  I didn't know you went for stuff like this.  Well, you have a whole lot to learn about me.  Was that just the phone ringing? Yeah   Big brother.  I let it go to voice mail.  He can wait till we're done here.  Good.  I want you all to myself.  So let the toasting begin.  To what comes next.  You're not drinking? Tastes like menthol, which, it turns out, is not that sexy.  What's the matter? Nothing.  Just bad memories.  That's right.  That was the   the one clue the ice truck killer left behind, right? Right.  Wait.  How did you know that? I don't often make mistakes, but when I do, they haunt me.  Hilarious.  Your champagne's gonna get warm.  You know the one thing I've been dying to ask you? How did you not know who I was? You're a cop.  This isn't funny.  I think a real cop would at least have a sense that she was in the presence of the person she was hunting.  Right? You're hurting me.  I didn't show you the best part of my loft.  Built it myself.  Stop it! The refrigerated room.  Oh, God, why are you doing this?! You know, the tricky part was getting you on the boat.  The other women I could just pay.  But at the end You made it easy.  So desperate to fall in love.  Stop.  Dude, you got to see this.  The autopsy on our Santa's cottage victim? Check it out.  One arm was shorter than the other.  So that got me thinking.  I mean, our guy isn't sloppy.    He's precise.    Not now, Vince.  Her left wrist was 2 inches shorter than her right.  I mean, why? Why cut off more on the left side than the right? Because our girl Our girl was a fucking amputee.  I looked up her medical records.  She had a fake left hand.  That's why we couldn't find it.  The killer cut off that extra piece of wrist so that we wouldn't see the stump.  Let me see that.  That night Batista was stabbed, he was following up on a lead he got from a one handed call girl.  Guess what the lead was about.  The ice truck killer.  Booyah.    You sure?   Positive.  The samples you gave me were a match.  They're from the same person.  Hey, you all right? Where's my sister? Took her code 12.  Left about an hour ago.  She went to dinner? She wasn't supposed to go anywhere.  Dispatch, this is Dexter Morgan.  I need you to raise officer Debra Morgan on her radio.  Sorry, sir.  She's been out of range for the last half hour.  It's Deb.  Do it.  Where the fuck are you? I'm here at work, and you're not.  I need to talk to you.  Do not see Rudy until you find me.  Call me when you get this.      Previous EpisodeNext Episode"

        "script": "Previously on \"Dexter\" I got here as fast as I could.  What are we looking at? Female victim, cut up into pieces.  The ice truck killer? So soon? This is what he wanted me to find all along.  Dexter Laura Moser My mother.  Laura Moser and 3 others found chopped up with a chain saw.  Your father was a decent man and an honest cop, but what he saw in that cargo container changed him.  Angel was stabbed from behind.  You think it's the attacker's blood? We know Batista fought back.  The samples you gave me were a match.  They're from the same person.  So if you or that skinny bitch try to screw with what's mine, I swear to God, I don't care who I have to hurt.  Let's face it, Paul.  You've been a problem.  I need you to explain to them why you're in this place.  I have no fucking idea why I'm in this place.  You really don't want to do this.  Effective immediately, you will no longer serve as my lieutenant.  This isn't fucking over, Tom! Debra Morgan Will you marry me? Yes, yes, yes.  Where's my sister? Took her code 12.  Left about an hour ago.  She went to dinner? She wasn't supposed to go anywhere.  You made it easy.  So desperate to fall in love.  Where the fuck are you? I'm here at work, and you're not.  I need to talk to you.  Do not see Rudy until you find me.  I've lived in darkness a long time.  Over the years, my eyes adjusted until the dark became my world and I could see.  But then Rudy turned on the light.  He flooded my memory, and now I'm blind.  I don't have much time   or, to be more accurate, my sister doesn't have much time.  He wants me to find him, but where do I look? I can't think.  It's too bright.  Let me know if the tape's too tight.  You know, there's no need for you to be uncomfortable.  Why are you doing this? Wouldn't want to spoil the surprise.  Oh, God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Shh, I'm just checking the supplies, okay? Things are moving a little faster than I had planned.  This isn't you.  Pretty sure it is.  No! I know there's more   I've seen it.  I never wanted to hurt you.  I know.  I know.  Does this make it easier for you? Because I can keep going.  Oh, God.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, Jesus Christ! Oh, Jesus Christ! There's nothing to be ashamed of, Deb.  I mean, you're not the only one who bought it, okay? Your name isn't even fucking Rudy Cooper, is it? Nope But he died for a good cause.  Yeah, so will you.  You kidnapped a cop this time, you know? Not some invisible hooker   you kidnapped a cop! It's all part of the plan.  Oh, Jesus.  It's hard to believe it's almost come to fruition.  I mean, this is a lot of years in the making.  We're only hours away.  He wouldn't have taken Deb unless he left me everything a clever monster would need in order to find them.  * Born free, * * As free as the wind blows * * As free as the grass grows * * Born free to follow your heart * Seems I have a new screen saver.  I knew he wouldn't leave me stranded, but \"Born free\"? Of course.  Thanks to Rudy, now I know where dearly disturbed Dexter was born.  Born free of all that's human   That's where I'll find him.  She knows.  She knows.  All fucking night with that.  She knows.  Listen, Angel, we need your help.  Masuka says you were following up a lead on the ice truck killer when you were attacked.  A hooker with a prosthetic hand.  John painted her nails different colors, but it didn't go nowhere.  Except she was just cut up by the ice truck killer.  Holy shit.  Monique was a victim? Now, we're operating on the theory that he found out you were on his trail.  And if we're right, that means you got stabbed for a reason.  It wasn't no carjacking.  How did he know it was me? No one knew what I was doing except Masuka.  Someone else had to know.  Think.  I consulted with Rudy, Debra's boyfriend, the prosthetics guy.  But that's crazy, right? No, she's been AWOL since going out last night to meet him.  She was supposed to come back and help me canvass,   but she never made it.    That's not like her.    Angel, we got to go.    Go, just go.  There are roughly 5,000 cargo containers in the port of Miami.  Finding the one where my mother was butchered took a bit of magic.  Busted.  Busted.  Shit.  Just a second! I told you he was here.  There some reason you're not answering your damn phone? Ambien.  What happened here, Dexter? I couldn't find the remote.  Where's your sister? She didn't come back to work, and she's not at her apartment.  I honestly don't know, sergeant.  Dexter We think her boyfriend Rudy's connected to the ice truck killer.  We're working on getting a search warrant right now to search his home.  No.  Wow Cut the crap.  You know something.  What? James! I saw him last night, skulking in the lab, ordering secret blood tests.  What kind of tests? I was looking for a type match on the blood on Batista's collar.  And whose was it? Rudy's.    Motherfucker.    Knock it off!   He knew all along!   Rudy lied about a cut on his lip.  Angel headbutted his attacker in the face.    It was just a wild hunch.    Why didn't you tell us? I couldn't destroy Deb's love life on a hunch.    I had to get the facts.    Here are the facts: if he kills her, it's your fault.  Now, what else do you know? That's it.  He's lying.  Give him a break, James.  It's his sister, all right? Well, if he knows what's good for her, he'll sit his ass at home and answer the fucking phone when it rings.  Call if you hear anything.  Hello? Please don't hang up.  Paul? The kids don't want to talk to you, all right? You got to give them more time.  This isn't about them.  It's about how I was arrested.  Yeah, with a needle in your arm   I know all about it.  Well, I don't.  Listen, I take responsibility for all the shit I pulled, but, Rita, I was in the program.  I kicked the hard stuff.  Well, apparently not.  I was clean.  I swear on my kids' lives.  It's been driving me nuts how I got   from your house one minute to the motel room the next, completely out of my mind on junk.  Yeah, it's called a blackout, Paul.    It's called a setup.    Well done.  The last thing I remember was standing in the kitchen, talking to Dexter.  Now, he could have smacked me over the head and dragged me out of the house probably through the backyard.  You really are a piece of work.  I'm telling you   Dexter is not who you think he is.  Hello? This one, I've got to make sure we got about seven copies of these.  I want to make sure it's distributed to everyone, okay? Okay, his name is Rudy Cooper.  Some of you may have met him.  He was dating officer Morgan.  Now, she was last seen 16 hours ago, driving to meet him at the Miami Beach marina.  So we need to canvass the entire area.  Check boat rentals.  You guys know the drill.  I've already sent a team over to his prosthetics lab at the hospital.  The judge just signed off on the warrant for Cooper's apartment.  Well, let's tear that place apart.  Jake, Sergio, Kim, you guys are with me.  Your attention, please.  I want to introduce you to our new lieutenant, Esmee Pascal.  She agreed to put her vacation on hold, come in early, to provide us with some much needed leadership at this critical time.  Lieutenant, you're on.  I understand we have a new suspect in the ice truck killer case.  We're on our way over now to search his place.  And you are Maria Laguerta.  And we have an officer missing, so we need to move fast.  I thought that sergeant Doakes was running that investigation.    He's out following a lead.    What lead? He said he'd let me know if it came to anything.  Now if you excuse me   I'll take it over from here.  Thank you, Maria.  Who here can get me up to speed on the way over? I can, I guess.  You're driving.  And feel free to join us when you locate your partner.  Would you like to come with us, captain? You seem to have everything under control.  Let's go, people.  It's in there somewhere   My birthplace.  Now what? No cameras, no patrols, no dogs.  With billions spent on Homeland Security, it can't be as easy as a couple of snips.  So much for the war on terror.  Finding a needle in a haystack isn't hard isn't hard when every straw is computerized.  Reefer yard, plug 4 3 6.  I don't like this place.  Something nameless was born here Something that lives in the deepest, darkest hole of the thing called \"Dexter.  \" Get in there! Somebody else   Get in there now! It's all right, little guy.  You're safe now.  Nothing will hurt you   I promise.  Okay, Deb don't be dead.  Shit.  Surprise, motherfucker.  Are you following me now? You better have a hell of a reason for being here.  I'm looking for my sister.  In a cargo box? Yeah, I'm kind of working on a theory.  You forget you work for the fucking cops? We love theories.  Spin me a story, asshole.  What I do on my time is my business, sergeant.  Yeah, me too, and I'm on my time now.  There's no lieutenant here to save your ass, so don't fuck with me, Morgan! All right, you got me.  I ordered some furniture from Thailand.  I was waiting for it to be delivered.  Lab geek   My ass.  Hey, what the hell's going on over here?! Security, I need to get somebody down here right now.  Miami metro P. D.  Yeah Is this guy under arrest? That's a good question.  You're connected to this.  I don't know how, but I'm gonna find out, and some of what I find is gonna stick to your ass.  Let me out of here, motherfucker! Let me out of here! Let me out! Let me out! Let me out, you piece of shit! Let me out of here, you fucking piece   Aah! Fuck! Let me out! Sorry, but you were drowning out Fred's radio, and he was kind enough to lend us his wheels.  Bye! His happy place, where he kills more than time   This is where he'd leave me a clue.    Hey, Dexter, better bundle up.    I like the cold.  You know, hypothermia can easily sneak up on you.  Yeah, and so can hypochondria.  And a home setup like this would take years to put together.  He must have hated leaving it behind.  What are you looking for? A clue, signature or calling card   Anything that might give us a sense of where he went.  Well, I don't think he was exactly thinking about us when he did this.  I mean, look at this place.  Hey, you were right about the victim at Santa's cottage.  He rushed his work.  He killed that girl to keep us busy so he could escape, but he wouldn't go without leaving us a message.  We just need to find it.  Check this out.  This is where he played with his meat.  Pretty whacked out, huh? I can think of 101 uses for this table.  Know what I mean? He has my sister, Vince.  Right.  I mean   I didn't mean   I'm sorry.  Shit.  You're Karen, right? That's right.  You're in charge of evidence   this entire room   evidence.  Take photos of every item in its original position: work kit, packages Show me the inventory list when you're done.  Is he in charge? Guess he is now.  Rita? Hi.  I'm Bob Hicks.  Can I help you? I guess Paul never mentioned me.  I'm his Narcotics Anonymous sponsor.  Right.  So, having your sponsor do your dirty work   Which step is that? See, he's   he's just concerned for the kids.  No, he's concerned for himself.  If you'll excuse me I thought he was lying, too, until I saw the proof.  What proof? Well, the X rays the prison doctor took of Paul's head   They showed a skull fracture.  Yeah, which I deservedly gave him.  No.  You didn't.  See, after you struck him, the hospital took X rays   No fracture.    But in prison, a fracture.    If you know Paul, you'd know he'd bash his own head against the wall to get what he wants.  Well, I do know Paul.  I think I know him pretty well.  No, listen, if Paul was attacked, the way that it happened   that takes expertise, skill.  No first timer is gonna be able to pull that off.  Yeah, which is why his accusations are ludicrous.  Dexter spends all his time in a laboratory, for God's sake.  So you've been there? Bob You seem like a nice man, but this is none of your goddamn business.  Okay.  Got it.  We traced the name and social of Rudy Cooper to a New Jersey plumber who mysteriously died in '98.  You got to be kidding me.  After all this, we still don't have an I. D.  on this guy? Rudy isn't his real name?   You trying to be smart?   Not trying, no.  If you fucking know his name, you better   Whatever it is going on between you two, it ends now.  What did you find in there? Other than the obvious, a lot of trace bloodstains.  It's probably where he killed them all, but I'd like to look at the rest of the apartment before I go.  Yeah, okay.    You mind if I   Be my guest.  It's perfect   Right out in the open.  At least he's consistent.  Was there anything else near this record player? Yeah, a fucking doll sitting on top.  \"Home sweet home.  \" Is he taking me back before the blood, to a place where a boy was born? \"Home sweet home\", but which \"home\"? Down on the floor, please.  It's kind of foolish, Deb.  I don't usually work this way.  Call it an homage to a fellow traveler I greatly admire.  Laura Moser   addict, dealer   My mother.  Arrested in '69, again in '71.  Same address listed both times.  1235 Mangrove Drive.  They say home is where the heart is.  Maybe this is where I left mine.  Surprise.  What are you doing here? White chocolate mocha   Your favorite.  I'm gonna have to drink it on the road.  You know, I've never even been here before.  I'd love a tour sometime.  Yeah, sometime that's not now.  Dexter, what's going on? It's Deb, okay? She's in trouble.  Oh, God.  Is it serious? Yeah, actually, it's very serious, but I just can't worry about you, too, right now.  She knows.  She knows.  She knows.  been leaving a trail of dead bodies.  Authorities say their big break came when they found a video of his latest victim.  If she knows, you yapping about it ain't gonna change it.  Shut the fuck up! The suspect is operating under an alias   \"Rudy Cooper.  \" We didn't have his fingerprints in our criminal database, so his identity is still unclear to us.    She knows.  She knows.    So sorry, Mr.  Batista.  We had to take the psych overflow from County,   but this one's harmless.    Yeah, don't be so sure.  We never take the violent ones.  They have the arsonists, the rapists, the psycho killers over there.  I tell you   Those people belong in prison.  Do they fingerprint psych patients at County? Yes, of course.  Half of them don't know their own names.  Got to I. D.  them somehow.  That should take care of him.  Enjoy the peace and quiet.  I. D.  tech.  Hey, it's, uh, Batista.  Can you do me a favor? I need you to run Rudy Cooper's prints against psych, mental, and institution records.  * Ring around the rosie * * A pocket full of posies * * Ashes, ashes * * We all fall down! * Dexter! Dexter! Where are you, you silly little bear? I'm gonna find you! Where can you be? You silly little goose.  I'm gonna find you! You silly bear.  Where is my baby? Where is my Dexter? Where are you?   Here!   Oh, my goodness! Oh my goodness! You surprised me, you stinky little bear.  Hey, where could your brother be hiding? Bynie's right there!   Hey, Bynie.    You weren't supposed to tell her.  You remember now? Bynie.  You always had trouble saying \"Brian.  \" I have a brother.  A real brother   None of this foster bullshit.  We're blood brothers, through birth and death.  Watching mom die   It's amazing that we survived that, isn't it? The chain saw, the flying body parts, the blood.  You were there, too.  Two days sitting in blood before they found us, but you were young enough to block it out.  I've never forgotten the day that we were   Born.    Exactly.  Where's Deb? I waited for you before we got started.    Debra!   She's not in here.  Deb! Debra! This is not the way I envisioned our family reunion.  Come on, let's just sit down and have a beer.  Deb? That was the best wipeout.  You didn't even cry.  Next time you try my skateboard, bend your knees, okay? Hi.  Hi.  Look out! I didn't want to do it this way.  Okay, let's run his description against Interpol's fugitive list, in case he isn't American.  Rudy Cooper? His real name is Brian Moser.  Angel, what the hell are you doing here? I got a hit on his prints from a Tampa mental hospital where he grew up.  He was institutionalized for antisocial personality disorder.  At 21, they said he was cured.  They released him.  Run the name \"Brian Moser\" for credit cards, bank accounts, real estate holdings   anything that might tell us where he's got Morgan.  Listen up.  We've triangulated officer Morgan's cellphone.  Last known location   which means he's got her on a boat.  Lieutenant, we have his real name.  We're digging into his records now.  His name's not gonna help us find him in open water.  I want a coordinated search with the coast guard.    Waste of time.    Chain of command.  Flyovers, helicopters, whatever it takes.  Lieutenant, that signal died last night.  By now, he has most likely taken her to his final location.  Noted.  Let's get busy, people.  Flyovers look good to the press, but they won't find Morgan.  You think the press matters to me? It matters to Captain Matthews, and he calls the shots.  Look, I know you need to define yourself here and putting me in my place is one way to do that, but one of our own is missing, and we shouldn't waste our time pissing on trees.  I agree.  I can also see why you were reassigned, and it has nothing to do with incompetence and everything to do with the Captain trying to save his job.  Okay.  Now, I was hired with the directive to not make your life easy.  So you're gonna ignore the lead? You don't know me very well, but luckily for officer Morgan, neither does the Captain.  Nothing personal.  I swore that I'd have a   beer with you before we got started.  You made that kind of difficult.  Sorry.  You don't ever have to apologize to me, Dexter.  Not for who you are or anything you do.  Looks just like it used to, doesn't it? Who does it belong to? Me.  I got it for you, actually.  I'm really more an apartment person.  You're trapped in a lie, little brother, the same lie they tried forcing me into.    \"They\"?   You know Doctors, therapists, group leaders   What a family they were.  You were never put up for adoption.  Afraid not.  You were 3, a little bird with a broken wing.  First cop on the scene   Harry Morgan.  He wanted to make you all better.  But me   I could see it in his eyes.  All he saw was a fucked up kid   They all did, so they locked me up.  I didn't even know you existed.  Of course you didn't.  Harry wanted to keep you all to himself.  And while you were being raised by the Morgan family, I only had the memory of a family.  Me.  Mom always told me to look after you.  Imagine how I felt when I tracked you down and found out you were exactly like me.  I don't have to imagine.  I know what you've been going through all these years   The isolation, the otherness, a hunger that's never satisfied.  Well, you're not alone anymore, Dexter.  You can be yourself with me   your real, genuine self.  Takes the breath away, doesn't it? I think we're ready for Debra.  I've prepared her just the way you like.  This time, we'll do it together.  Does it have to be Deb? It's the only way.  But she's my Fake sister I know.  Tell me something Your victims   Are they all killers? Yes.  Harry teach you that? He taught me a code To survive.  Like an absurd avenger? That's not why I kill.  You can be yourself around me.  Who am I? A killer without reason or regret.  You're free.  You can be that way, too.  What about the code? Damn it, Dex, you don't have a code.  Harry did.  And he's been dead 10 years.  You can't keep him sitting on your shoulder like Jiminy fucking Cricket.  You need to embrace who you are now.  I don't know who I am.  Of course you don't.  You've been away from your family since you were 3, but I'm here now.  I can help you.  We can take this journey together.  I can't.  Not Deb.  Oh, no.  Don't   Don't say that.  I'm very fond of her.  You can't be a killer and a hero.  It doesn't work that way! Morgan! Cover the yard! We're going into the house! Fuck.  In the garage! Through that door! Cover this door! Cover the door! Come on.  Stay with me.  Shit.  Maria, stay on the door.  He's trapped inside.  I'm breaking in.  Cover me, man.  Get in.  Shit.  Chopper 1 to command   We're broadening the search to a 5 mile radius.  Any headache, dizziness? I'm fine.  I just want to go home.  I'm afraid we have to transport you to the hospital   Standard procedure.  You're saying Rudy called you? Why would he do that? I think he wanted me to try to talk him down.  He said he was having second thoughts about killing Deb.  He seemed to feel like we have some kind of connection.  He's not the only one.  He said he'd kill Deb if I didn't show up alone.  Well, you almost fucking got her killed.  I'm gonna request an immediate suspension when we get back to the station.  You're gonna what? Morgan, you shouldn't be out here.  Are you questioning Dexter? Morgan.  Back the fuck off my brother! He just saved my life! He's a fucking hero! Want each of you to treat him that way, god damn it! Way to go, Deb.  I thought you were gonna burst a frontal lobe out there.  Assholes.  Stop.  You're gonna dislocate it.  Oh, God, get it off me.  I'm gonna be sick.  Relax.  Here.  He's still out there.  Yeah.  And he didn't get what he wanted.  No.  Think he'll try it again? Maybe.  Yeah.  I'm gonna talk to Captain Matthews about getting us an officer stationed outside your hospital room tonight.  No, I'm not staying in a fucking hospital.  There's nothing fucking wrong with me.  Well, you're not staying at home.  Well, I'll just crash with you.  Let's just wait and see what the doctor says, all right? Yeah.  Yeah.  Why me, Dex? Why'd he choose me? You're just lucky, I guess.  I was so scared.  I was so scared, so scared.  I know.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Dad would be so proud.    Dexter?   It's me.  Paul, this is harassment.  Just tell me if he's acting weird.    Who?   Dexter   He hasn't been himself lately, has he? How could he be, after what he did to me? All right, that's it.  I'm done.  Call again, and you can forget about seeing the kids this weekend or ever.  I am not gonna subject them to your insanity.  Fine, if that's what it takes for you to listen to me.  I just want to know that they're safe.  Why are you doing this, Paul? You want me to be miserable and alone like you? Is that it? All I want is for you to look for a shoe.  A shoe? Could be in the kitchen.  Could be in the backyard.  It's missing.  I checked, and it wasn't in the items that they got from the motel room when I was arrested.  And why would it be here? I was trying to figure out why my ankle was so bruised.  Now I'm thinking it got banged when Dexter dragged me out,   when my shoe was knocked off.    Good night, Paul.  Night.  Screw you.  What did I just do? I drove away a brother who accepts me, sees me, for an adopted sister who'd reject me if she knew and a foster father who betrayed me.  That's what it was   A betrayal.  The most important single fact about me   I'm not alone   and Harry kept it from me.  What do I really owe him after that? Mr.  Morgan? Mr.  Morgan? That's me.  Your sister has a few bruises, but no major injuries.  Still, you should keep an eye on her.  I'll write a prescription for a mild sedative.  But she's okay, right? She can go home with you tonight, far as I'm concerned, or we can keep her here at the hospital   it's your choice.  Don't worry.  The sheets are clean.  We aim to please here at \"Chez Dex\".  I'll be sleeping on the couch with a spring in my side just to make sure you're safe tonight, but We're gonna have to talk tomorrow about a long term plan, after you get a good night's sleep.  Deb? Good night, sister.  I stopped by your prosthetics lab after I left Deb at the hospital.  Your work's so good, you even fooled yourself.  Sweet dreams, Bynie.  Hey.  You weren't supposed to wake up.  I guess not.  Sorry.  Police recorded all your knives as evidence.  Took a while to find your dinner flatware.  Sterling.  I keep it for special occasions.  Which you are.  I can give you more tranquilizer if you want.  It's a service I don't usually offer.  What am I   One of your victims now? You going to collect a little sample of Bynie's blood for your slide collection? No, you're not a trophy but you need to be put down.  Why? Because of your code? The safety of my sister.  She's not your real sister.  She's a stranger to you, and she'll always be one.  I tried to help you by killing her.  I know that! You should know this isn't easy for me.  You've done more to deserve my knife than anyone.  You're the only one I ever wanted to set free.  You're the one that needs setting free, little brother.  Your life is a lie.  You'll never be what you   Sorry.  I can't hear any more 'cause you're right.  How did you know he was here? A neighbor saw the door open.  We got his fingerprints on the knife, a note on the fridge, and a single incised wound to the neck.  Slight upward angle.  Even a stigmata of hesitation in the stroke.  Looks like a clear suicide.  He does himself the same way he did the hookers.    Poetic.    Retarded.  Look at him   He's dead.  The ice truck killer always flaunted his kills like he was untouchable.  By taking his own life, he's preventing us from ever catching him.  I don't care why he did it.  I'm just glad he did.  Decaf mochaccino, nonfat, no whip   your favorite.  I got your message.  How's Debra? She has all her limbs.  Thank God she's alive.  That poor thing must be a mess   Falling for a serial killer.  What are the odds?   What about you?   What about me?   Are you all right?   Oh, yeah.  No.  I've been through a lot lately.  I could use a little more time with you   and the kids.  We could, too.  I'm sorry I've been so   Next time, could you just let me know what's going on? I mean, when you didn't return my calls, I   started to get a little paranoid.  I can be better about that.  Good.  Who knows? You might even find I can handle the truth.  I wish that was the case.  The reality is, there's nobody left alive who can handle my truth.  Doakes always sensed I was hiding something.  Now he knows.  My devil danced with his demon, and the fiddler's tune is far from over.  Sometimes, I wonder what it would be like for everything inside me that's denied and unknown to be revealed.  But I'll never know.  I live my life in hiding.  My survival depends on it.  Dearly damaged Debra   She's here to face what's left of the monster, spit on his carcass, mourn him.  She's in hiding now, too.  Harry's daughter will be damned if she lets anyone see what she's suffering inside.  That's her tragedy.  My tragedy is that I killed the one person I didn't have to hide from.  And I'm the only one who mourns him.  Everyone else would probably thank me if they knew I was the one who drained him of his life.  Good job in there, Dex.  You sliced him up good.  In fact, deep down, I'm sure they'd appreciate a lot of my work.  Way to take out the trash.  Thanks, buddy.  All right, Dexter, protecting our children! This is what it must feel like to walk in full sunlight, my darkness revealed, my shadow self embraced.  Yeah, they see me.  I'm one of them in their darkest dreams.

        "script": "Blood.  Sometimes, it sets my teeth on edge.  Other times, it helps me control the chaos.  Last season on Dexter Tonight's the night and it's going to happen again, and again.  Open your eyes and look at what you did! Please, you have to understand.  Trust me, I definitely understand.  Children, I could never do that, not like you.    Why?   I have standards.    You better be a cop.    No, forensics.    They found another hooker.    Another? That's the 3rd one in five months.  There's no blood near the body at all.  It's the weirdest thing you ever saw.  I've never seen such clean dry neat looking, dead flesh.  How does the killer get rid of the blood? I think this is a friendly message.  Kind of like: \"Hey, wanna play?\" And yes, I wanna play.  I really, really do.  What's this sick son of a bitch trying to tell us? Not us, me.  Interesting hand job.  You think this is our guy's work? The Ice Truck Killer.  This feels familiar.  When he broke into my apartment, he took some time to get to know me.  My life, my secrets he knows.  He's not corrupting the happy Hallmark images of my youth.  He's revealing the ugly truth behind them.  Son, there are people out there who do really bad things.  But of course, you have to learn how to spot them, but I can teach you.  The code of Harry, my foster father, is satisfied.  So how the hell was your date with Rita last night? Great.  She's perfect because Rita is, in her own way, as damaged as me.    I want   a normal life.  Yeah, a normal life.  The killer is an artist.  You give me the fucking creeps, you know that? Yeah, I know.  Sorry about that.  Why in a building full of cops, is Doakes, the only one who gets the creeps from me? I want you and Rita to meet my boyfriend.  Dex, Rudy's different.  I feel safe with him.  I think I'm falling for him.  I waited a long time to meet you.  Dad's coming home? If their dad shows up, we'll deal with it together.  Paul Bennett, father on parole.  Are you fucking my wife? My heart beats for those two kids, so if you or that skinny bitch try to screw with what's mine, I swear to God, I don't care who I have to hurt Let's face it, Paul, you've been a problem.  It's time for you to go away.  He smacked me over the head, dragged me out of the house probably through the backyard.  All I want is for you to look for a shoe.  It's missing, I'm telling you.  Dexter is not who you think he is.  Do I have the pleasure of your company this weekend? We've had a major break in the Ice Truck Killer case.  Debra Morgan will you marry me? Yes, yes!   Where's my sister?   Took her code 12.  Left about an hour ago.  How did you not know who I was? I think a real cop would at least have a sense that she was in the presence of the person she was hunting.  Where the fuck are you? I'm here at work, and you're not.  I need to talk to you.  Do not see Rudy until you find me.  You're connected to this.  I don't know how, but I'm gonna find out, and some of what I find is gonna stick to your ass.  I was hoping you could dig up an old case file for me.  Well, sure thing.  It's the crime scene where Harry found me.  This is what he wanted me to find all along.  He's showing me where to go.  Laura Moser and three others found chopped up with a chain saw.  What is in that report that Harry didn't want me to see? What he saw in that cargo container changed him.  You were left there for days, starving, in blood 2 inches thick.  You remember now? I have a brother.  A real brother.  I didn't even know you existed.  Imagine how I felt when I tracked you down and found out you were exactly like me.  You can't be a killer and a hero.  It doesn't work that way! Why me, Dex? Why'd he choose me? You're just lucky, I guess.  I was so scared.  What am I, one of your victims now? No, you're not a trophy but you need to be put down.  Sorry.  I drove away a brother who accepts me, for a foster father who betrayed me.  I'm not alone and Harry kept it from me.  Doakes always sensed I was hiding something.  Now, he knows.  My devil danced with his demon, and the fiddler's tune is far from over.  Anyone/Lemonhead/Sixe Tonight's the night and it's going to happen again, and again.  Has to happen.  It's not what I want, for what I want doesn't matter.  This is the only way I know how to survive.  I'm coiled and ready to strike.  Although a spare will do.  Nice.  Nice warmer ball.  Now, you can get that.  Remember.  Loose arm swing.  Loose.  Got it.  Yeah, and keep your mind limber.  I'm doing mental Jumping Jacks.    Don't forget.    Oki, doki.  I'm on edge.  Thirty eight days, sixteen hours, and twelve minutes have passed since I killed my brother.  In that entire time, I haven't had a single night to myself.  Sergeant Doakes makes sure of that.  He follows me everywhere now.  My human bloodhound incited by the scent of darkness.  My best hope of losing him is to act relentlessly normal.  Dull.  So I bowl.  What's really disturbing is that I'm good at it.    Holes, Dex.    You pictured it, didn't you? Hey, striker! We need you locked down, tonight, huh? We're playing the Alley Cats.  I'm a little tense, Angel.  But I'll try my best not to let the team down.  Try, peso, try.  You gotta think positive, bro.  Cause what we think creates the world around us.  It's all about energy and interconnectedness.  I mean, you gotta think positive.  Angel lost someone too.  When his wife left him.  Now, he's going toward the light, searching for answers.  He found one, on an Oprah rerun.  I wish it were that easy for me.  And we just got to direct it to manifest what we want.  Alright.  Dude, just bowl a strike so we can go have some fun at the strip clubs.  I want to see a real 7 10 split.  I wish I could have fun.  With Doakes tailing me, my life's been all Jekyll and no Hyde.  No moon lit play dates, no late night social calls.  Not one.  My brother would be so disappointed.  Don't forget: tell the universe what you need.  I really need to kill somebody.  Did you even take my advice? I'm telling you.  The universe can be very generous.  It certainly can.  For weeks, I've known who was next.  Who belonged to me.  I just needed Doakes to take a night off.  What do you need? I need to curse someone.  What kind of curse? Death curse.  We don't do that kind of thing here.  You can go down to Little Haiti.  Find all the Hoodoo Voodoo you need there.  You are Jimmy Senseo, high priest, right? The man with God in his mouth.  I'm not a tourist.  I need a Petro curse and I heard you were the best.  Thank you, for your offering.  Come.  A blind man.  Not very sporting, I know.  But I'm not one to discriminate based on race, gender or disability.  What is happening? The only pertinent question is: what happened to your victims.  What are you doing? What do you want? I can see how this might be confusing for you, Jimmy, but my favorite part's kinda ruined here.  This is where I normally show you the innocent people you killed.  I brought them along, anyway.  That's part of my death ritual.  Since you're blind, I'll just remind you.  Emmanuel Azua.  Jean Philippe Peguero.  Nono Baptiste.  I didn't kill them.  I cast them.  And then a remarkable coincidence, they each die of respiratory failure with fluid in their lungs.  I guess murder is one way to make your curses come true.  Good for business.  What? What was that? Just the next part of the ritual.  How did you administrate the ricin poison to your victims? I am the one with the power in these hands.  That's not entirely accurate.  Those who believe in me shall be free.  Knock it off! How do you poison them? Not me.  Madulli, The Petro spirit told me, put the powder, in the aguardiente bottles that they buy from me.  And I did it.  Thank you, Jimmy.  My ritual's almost complete.  Madulli curses you! You! I'm afraid Madulli's a little late to the party on that one.  Appreciate your helping me out tonight, Jimmy.  I've been waiting a long time for this.  I really needed it.  What the fuck? Let that be a lesson to you.  I've always enjoyed my work.  It brings order to the chaos, fills me with civic pride.  But what was that back there? Not voodoo.  When I picked up the knife, it's like I didn't know who I was.  I come here to dump bodies, not beer bottles.  Now, I'm just a little bug.  What are doing working out in the middle of the night?   I couldn't sleep.    Tomorrow's your big day.  Where the fuck were you? I was worried about you.  Bowling.  Kinda late for bowling.  Kinda not looking for your opinion.  You said you cleaned the place today.  I did.  It got messed up again.  I'll suppose you were looking at apartment rental ads while you were on the treadmill.    If you want me out of here, just   I don't.  I just had a bad bowling night.  What I meant was, whenever you're ready to be on your own, I'll help you with the transition, that's all.  Thanks, Dex.  Thanks for putting up with me.  You're all I got.  It's not such a great bargain for you, huh? I'm not complaining.  Night.  It's your turn on the couch.  Could you at least pick up your Debra can't sleep in an empty house anymore.  In fact, she can't sleep much at all.  I guess that's what happens when your fianc\u00e9 tries to slice you up into small bloodless pieces.  Pathetic.  Did you see that? Nice shooting, Dex.  We need to talk.  Those boars won't stand a chance.    Hope one charges me.    No, you don't.    That thing got massive stopping power.    Slow down.  I got bad news.  They need me to take a shift at work.  Right now?   What about the boar hunt?   We'll plan another trip.  I waited two weeks for this trip.    You can wait another one.    No, I can't! If you read the books, you know that psychopaths like me have a low tolerance for frustration.  Dexter, enough with the psychopath bullshit.  You're in control of your urges, not the other way around.  You don't understand, dad, I need this.  It's not just a sport to me.  I'm sorry, son, I have responsibilities at work.  Now, come on.  I'll drop you off at home.  Give me the gun.  There's cheese in that donut? Oh, that's a Danish.  Look, they forgot the frosting on this one.  Some people like donuts, plain, no frosting.  I can't even get donuts right.  What's going on here? Sorry guys, I was in a hurry, I just ordered a dozen pastry buffs, like you two deserve better than this.  Thanks, Dexter.  We're gonna go visit my dad in jail today.  Wanna come? Afraid I gotta work, buddy.  Thanks for getting here so fast.  What's the emergency? Hip Hop Harry is on.  We're good for fifteen minutes.  I know we're supposed to have dinner tonight, but I just had this urge.  I'm all for satisfying urges.  I just wish I knew why I couldn't satisfy mine, last night.    Is everything okay?   It will be.  Just keep going.  Any minute, now Sorry.  No, it's my fault, I shouldn't be springing this on you.  No, I'm just feeling a little pressure at work.  I'll be okay.  I follow the code.  The stalk was good.  I'm just a little rusty since killing my brother.  Or maybe I took pity on my victim.  I mean, sure, he's a heinous killer, but he also bumps into walls.  Hey, Sergeant.  Thank for supporting the bowling team.  Fuck you! Where's my blood report on the Maynard victim? So what's that? A titty site?   Caught me.    Bullshit.  What the hell were you really doing in here? The tits are right there.  But in ten years, you've never rented a single porn title.  How would you know? Call me an office crazy, but your humbling interest in my personal life could be misinterpreted as harassment in some circles.  So, report me.  I could think of easier solutions.  Nice tits.    James, you got any misdemeanor A form?   Filed in the filing cabinet.  Can anybody tell me where the goddamn misdemeanor A forms are kept? I've got some right here, Lieutenant.  OK, alright, move along.  Nothing to see here, just another fucking day at work.  Welcome back, Morgan.  Thanks.  Maria.  A tour boat guide called in a body down at the Breakwater.  I want you to take Doakes and a support team.  And take Morgan.  I want to get her back out on the field today.  She's not ready.  Shouldn't even be here.  What's it been, five weeks, six? Appreciate your concern, but according to her psych evaluation, she's ready to get back out onto the field.  You just gotta look her in the eyes to know she's not right.  You put her onto the field, she could melt down, freak out.  She hugged me.  Alright, you partner with her today so you can keep an eye on her.    That's   not a request.  Put Doakes with Batista.  Fine.  I know that it's difficult for you to take orders when you feel that you should be giving them.  And I really appreciate your professionalism.  Thanks.  Thank you.  You don't like roses? Allergies.  Let me know what you find out about that body.  Okay, guys, listen up.  Heard your sister's back on the job already.  Is she in any kind of shape? Well, you know Deb, nothing gets her down.  No, I mean, did she pack on any pounds while she was gone, cause last time I saw her, she was tight.  We got multiple chop wounds, pretty much head to toe.  Alright, you call it.  Heads or tails?   Heads.    Hey, I didn't flip yet.    You said \"call it\".    Damn, I always get the ass end.    Here you go, Sergeant.    Nevermind.  I got sharp force trauma here.  Heavy impact, parallel wounds.  Maybe an axe.  No, the defense wounds on the forearms are long and linear.  I can make out bevelled margins.  A machete did this.  The machetes are weapons of choice of the 29th St.  Kings.  The victim was in the gang judging from that tattoo.  We think the body was carried from a nearby location.  I found a real good blood trail coming down from the road.  Lens.  Just make sure we check the dock's lifts for criminal records.  It's possible this victim was killed by one of these boat owners out here.  Or maybe it was just an easy access spot to dump a corpse at night.  No light poles, and the freeway exit ramp is just a block away.  He's got a point.  Yo, Dex.  You're supposed to preserve the crime scene, asshole.  What's the matter with you today? Just a little off my game.  I'll get it back.    What time did you find the body?   Seven o'clock.  I start prepping the Banana Boat every morning at seven o'clock   for Miami Banana Tour.    Banana Tour? It's a Calypso journey through Miami's inner harbor.    And you should try it.    I'll think about it.  Ain't that the Ice Truck Killer's babe? She was in the paper.  She's fucking hot!   Did you see anyone else out here?   No, not this morning.    Are you sure?   Yeah, I'd have given him a brochure.  Hey, Mrs.  Ice Truck Killer! Oh, God.  Hang on, hang on.  Just turn around, look scared for the camera.  Well, if you think of anything else, you have our numbers.  And you have mine.  Can I pass these on now?   Knock yourself out.    Thank you.  Just look over here, look scared for the camera.  Thank you.  What, you need help with something? Rafael!   Where is Rafael?   Sergeant! Grab her! Somebody stop her! Goddamnit, Morgan, grab her! Can we please secure this motherfucking crime scene? What did she say? That's her son.  She says she knows who killed him.  Some guy named Little Chino.    Felt like she was asking me something.    She was.  She wants you to find Little Chino and kill him like a dog.  That look I know that look.  Like her mother, she wants someone to do something.  And next stop on Matchie the matchbook's magical journey down the rainbow path is the dreaded chocolate swamp.  Why is it dreaded? I love chocolate.  Because the chocolate swamp is the home of a goopey gooey nightmare named Glappy who turns children to Fudgsicles and eats them What does Matchie do? Well, luckily, Glappy was sleeping, so Matchie goes straight to Candy Castle where he becomes King Candy, who can turn everyone into sweets with a wave of his royal gum ball staff.  Cool story, dad.  But next time, can we play the actual game? First chance I get, I'll talk to the warden about finding some of those missing game pieces, okay? Gotta go, kids.  Alright, say goodbye to your father.  Jump, jump! What's wrong with your lip? Well, I was biting it, cause I was excited to see you.  So come back real soon, okay? Rita, one minute? Go wait by the door.  I need your help, my lawyer's gonna file my appeal tomorrow.  But I don't stand a chance without that shoe.  There's no shoe.  How many times I have to tell you that? Anything, any evidence to support the fact that I was set up.    You mean that Dexter set you up.    Somebody set me up.  Rita, I'm not doing real good in here, okay? It's a federal prison.  Hardcore.  I don't belong here.  Will you help me? I need to go.  See you in a couple of weeks.  Will you please take Eva's statement? Set up her daughter Marissa with some crayons.  Sure thing.  That girl's gonna need more than crayons to make her world right.  Killing Little Chino could restore my world too, but only if he satisfies Harry's code.  I see you've been benched? LaGuerta is just jealous the Ice Truck Killer fucked me instead of her.  You chipper.  I'm just happy to be back on the job.  What do you want? I'm just working on my blood report from the crime scene today, I wondered what you found on the suspect.  Cocksucker's guilty as they come.  He's an inforcer for the 29th St.  Kings, East Side gang, intensely violent.  He's been linked to 9 murders in the last five years.  So far, so good.  I just hope he's not blind.    Has he ever been tried?   Twice.  But the witnesses in each case were murdered.  We think by Chino himself.  Now, people are just too afraid to come forward.  Come on, Chino! Right this way.  Fucking beef bus! Dad! I'm okay, Dex.  I've told you never put your finger on the trigger unless you're shooting!   Are you okay?   Jesus! That was close! My heart's beating out of my chest! Let me feel!   Feel what?   Your heart! That's amazing! A challenge.  A mountain to climb.  I need this one.  Little Chino came to me front door.  He ask for me son Rafael.  Rafael did not want to go with Little Chino.  But he was afraid not to.  What was he going to do? My brother was living in Georgia.  Rafael was going to leave me with him.  That's why he kill him I know *never ** leave this!* Eva! Are you willing to testify that Little Chino picked up your son on the night of his death? Come on, don't back down now.  I want him to pay.  Got him! Oh, that's discouraging With a grieving mother as a witness, Little Chino will never reach my cutting courtroom.  Hey, Morgan.  You wanna see something swell? Come a little closer.  And the token has spoken.  Good to see you too, Vince.  I heard we captured Big Foot? Behold! The 8th wonder of the world.  Am I speaking clearly? Then, answer my fucking question, Chino! What time did you pick up Rafael, last night? Last night? I didn't see Rafael last night.  OK.  So, why would Rafael's mother make up that story, Chino? That puta's into the devil's candy, man.  Fucking heroin.  Shit.  She was probably high.  You're telling me that Eva Raines is a junkie? If that's true, Pasquale and LaGuerta are gonna have a piss party.  Eva Raines, two pops for drug possession.  // Ranez? No fucking way the D. A.  puts a drug user on the stand.  That chulo's gonna walk again.  But not very far.  We'll both be vindicated soon.  OK boys, today's our day.  If we find that galley, it'll bring back gold! There's an aberration on the sea floor.  The crevice's at 65 feet.  It has to be where the Santa Rosa went down.  The crevice's 30 to 40 yards straight ahead.  Crevice should be 25 yards ahead.  Baring 1 1 4.  I need your help.  I know how much you were looking forward to going out, tonight, but I think Deb could use you more.  Dexter, this isn't about this morning, is it? No! I swear.  This is for Deb.  She had her first day at work, today, and LaGuerta was kind of rough on her.    Dexter, unlock the door!   Hold on.  Hold on! Dexter, come on! Open the fucking door! See, she's yelling at me, now.  Look, I'm no expert, but I think Deb could use some girl time tonight.  I won't lie I'm a little disappointed, but I know your heart's in the right place.  Absolutely.  OK, whatever you need, Dexter.  Thank you, Rita.  I will make this up to you.  I'm gonna have Deb pick you up in a half hour, okay? Bye.  Sorry.  I double booked when I made plans to go out with Rita tonight.  I forgot that I had promised to sub for another bowling team.  Why are you so happy about it? I like bowling, what can I say? Look, will you take Rita out for me?   She hired a babysitter and everything.    No way, I need to work out.  Actually, you need to stop working out.  It's getting unhealthy.  You should go out for some hard liquor instead.    Sorry, bro.    Deb, please! When do I ever ask you for anything? You bung hole.  Why did you have to put it that way? She's expecting you in half an hour.  You're a life saver! Tonight's the night.  Really.  Harry would prefer I take more time, but my life is falling apart.  Whatever stopped my knife before won't stop it again.  Hey, there! I'm gonna work on my release, tonight.  Practise, practise, practise! Lane's open till midnight.  You wanna join me? Fuck it! There's nothing else to talk about! You are a liar!   You lie!   Would you stop? You gonna act a lot better! If you want me to act better, then you treat me better! You got these things all mixed up in your head! Listen to me, I love you.  Alright? It's all about you! There is nobody else! Is that why you sent me three dozen fucking roses?   Get out of my sight!   There's noboby else! I sent you flowers, baby, because I love you.  Get out of my sight! I've got nothing else to say to you, until you decide to man up! Please, go.  Maria? Fuck! I'm sorry you had to hear that.  That was my fianc\u00e9.  We are having some problems.  Well, that happens.  I called his house 3 nights in a row and he says he's working.  He didn't return my phone calls.  And then he comes home and he says he's tired.  He is tired because he's out there fucking some bitch.  I can smell it on him.  Don't worry about washing their hair.    And read to them before bed.    Okay, got it.  You've a collect call from Paul Bennett.    Will you take the charges?   Yes, I'll accept the charges.  Excuse me.  Rita, do you have a second? I need to talk to you.  What do you want? I'm not gonna make it, in here.  I don't have time for your bullshit right now, Paul.  It's not bullshit! I'm not like these guys, I don't belong here, Rita.  Can you help me? Help you? What? Just Can you look for the shoe one more time? I found the fucking shoe, okay? You what? That's great! I'll call the lawyer in the morning! Look, why does it matter? It's just a shoe, it doesn't mean anything.  You were probably high on smack when you lost it at my house.  Whatever, I'll let the court fucking decide that! It's a good news! If you send a lawyer to my house, the shoe won't be here.  I'm not gonna let you drag Dexter into this! I'm in a healthy relationship.  Finally! And I'm not gonna throw it away to bail out my abusive ex husband! It doesn't work that way.  Look, I gotta go! No, you don't! Rita, don't hang up that fucking phone! Stop blaming other people for your problems! You're in prison, now, Paul.  Deal with it.  Some gangs earn teardrops of blood by killing.  I understand.  We all need our keepsakes.  One man's tattoos are another man's blood slides.  All I had to do was call the gang task force, ask where the 29th St.  Kings get their tattoes, and wait for my prey to show up.  What the fuck? What the fuck! Get the fuck off me! Fuck! Get the fuck off! Fuck that shit! The scene of the failed crime.  No better place to try again.  I have it on good authority the owner fled town.  Plus it's a much quieter working environment now without the chickens.  So You and Dexter come here a lot? We love the Hot Wings.  Look, I'm sorry if I'm such bad company tonight.  Paul called right before we left.  Yeah? What did he want? Who knows? Make me feel bad he's in prison, I suppose.  I'm the one that answered that domestic dispute call way back when, remember? That prick deserves to be in prison.  I know, I know.  I'm just I can't believe I still let him get to me after everything he's put me through.  Oh God I'm such an idiot.  What you went through is so much worse than my problems.  What? My psycho killer fianc\u00e9? Please.  I've had worse.  At least, he paid for my meals.  I can't believe you moved on like that.  I wish I could be more like you.  I mean Paul was so horrible to me.  Really horrible.  Sometimes And don't tell Dexter, but Sometimes, I find myself missing the good parts of him.  God Not him.  Not him.  It's not him that you miss.  Because what he had to offer wasn't real.  The way he made you feel about yourself That was real.  Hey, are you okay? Need a refill? Can I get another draught, please? Excuse me? Don't I know you from somewhere? Haven't I seen you on television? Are you that girlfriend What the fuck are you doing?   Debra, what happened?   He grabbed me! You saw him, right?   He grabbed me.    I think you broke   my nose!   He fucking grabbed me! All I did was touch you! You saw it! He grabbed me! He wasn't easy to get here, but here he is.  And here I am.  Ready.  Willing.  Able.  Shit! There's not enough tape! Perfect! 39 days, 22 hours and 18 minutes since I killed my brother.  I am cursed.  What the hell do you think you're doing?   What were you doing?   I don't know.    What were you thinking?   I don't know! Whatever you're going through, killing yourself is not the answer! You don't get points for dying! Dying? Dad, I don't wanna die! I'm just trying to figure out some way to feel alive! I don't normally seek human contact in times of failure.  But then, I don't normally experience failure.  Right now, all I can think about is the smell of Rita's kitchen.  The breathy cadence of her sleeping children.  The warmth of her flesh.  What's wrong? The prison called.  Paul's dead.  He died in an inmate altercation.  It's a fight.  He was angry, and he got into a fight.  Now, I have to figure out how to tell my children their father's dead.  And I could have helped him.  How? How could you have helped him? He was in prison.  That's right, Dexter.  It happened in prison.  Paul was in prison.  That was his own fault.  Was it? You okay? Rita said you got in a bar brawl tonight.  You gotta see this.  Mount Pleasant, at 81 and Salem They've been playing it on the news all night.  Two treasure hunters made a ghastly discovery today, when they stumbled on what appears to be an underwater graveyard, in a crevasse, off the coast of Miami.  There's bodies in those bags.  The butchered bodies were submerged inside these heavy duty garbage bags.  Authorities have located at least 30 bags so far, but around the clock salvage efforts are still underway.  Did you hear that? Thirty bags! Do you know what that means? There might be a new mass murderer out there, way worse than the Ice Truck Killer.  Maybe I can finally get some peace! Isn't that great? It's amazing!       Previous EpisodeNext Episode"

        "script": "Previously on Dexter I'm on edge.  Thirty eight days have passed since I killed my brother.  In that entire time, I haven't had a single night to myself.  Sergeant Doakes makes sure of that.  With Doakes tailing me, my life's been all Jekyll and no Hyde.  My brother would be so disappointed.  I really need to kill somebody.  I've been waiting a long time for this.  What the fuck I'll be okay.  I followed the code.  The stalk was good.  I'm just a little rusty since killing my brother.  Debra can't sleep in an empty house anymore.  I guess that's what happens when your fianc\u00e9 tries to slice you up into small bloodless pieces.  Welcome back, Morgan.  Thanks.  You just gotta look her in the eyes to know she's not right.    Are you that   What the fuck are you doing? Rita, I'm not doing real good in here, okay? Will you help me? I found the fucking shoe, okay? That's great! I'll call the lawyer in the morning! I'm not gonna let you drag Dexter into this! The prison called.  Paul's dead.  And I could have helped him.  That was his own fault.  Was it? What's the matter with you today? Just a little off my game.  I'll get it back.  Felt like she was asking me something.  That's her son.  She says she knows who killed him.  Some guy named Little Chino.  She wants you to find Little Chino and kill him like a dog.  Are you willing to testify that Little Chino picked up your son on the night of his death? Come on, don't back down now.  I want him to pay.  A challenge.  A mountain to climb.  I need this one.  The scene of the failed crime.  No better place to try again.  I don't normally experience failure.  Thirty nine days, twenty two hours, and eighteen minutes since I killed my brother.  I am cursed.  Two treasure hunters made a ghastly discovery today, when they stumbled on what appears to be an underwater graveyard, in a crevasse, off the coast of Miami.  Do you know what that means? There might be a new mass murderer out there, way worse than the Ice Truck Killer.  I'm drifting.  I finally get a chance to kill and I can't do it.  And a second chance and he gets away.  And now all my secrets are floating to the surface.  Where is the orderly, controled, effective, Dexter? How did I loose him? How do I find him again? I'm drifting.  But not to sleep.  A shocking and gruesome discovery off the coast of Florida yesterday.  Police are still searching through mountain of evidence found lying at the bottom of the ocean.  Sources say there could be multiple victims Here I am.  Back in the belly of the beast.  But how can I solve a crime when I can't even solve what's wrong with me? Yet, duty calls.  Eight confirmed.  Eight confirmed, here?   Here is just one.    We're talking 8 confirmed victims in the Bay Harbor Butcher.  \"The Bay Harbor Butcher\"? That's what the press is calling whoever dumped those bodies off shore.  Has a nice ring to it, no? Well, it's a little   lurid.    Lurid and possibly wrong.  Part of me is hopping they found the Ice Truck Killer dumping ground.  Tell me about it.  Last thing Miami needs is another serial killer.  Eva Arenas All she wanted was justice against the 29th St.  Kings for whacking her son.    First she is the messenger.    Now, she's the god damn message.  Death by machete.  Again.  We got a BOLO on Little Chino.  Gang crash unit, all local patrols after that cabron.  Last thing I want is for the cops to bring Little Chino in.  He's mine.  Why don't you take a picture, Morgan, it will last longer.  What would I do without you sergeant? Please segnora, mas despacias   Please slower   It's mas despacio! She saying any fucking cops aren't do nothing.    Grand Ma really talk like that?   Not exactly.  But you got the point.  Right, bitch? Fuck the people don't wanna help.  Shit, she got a little girl.  I know.  This stuff never gets to you? I'm more of a crying on the inside kind of guy.  Mister Ice Truck Killer look like a god damn artist.  Sorry, Morgan.  What? I'm so over that.  You're just fucking with me.  I'm gonna have to put you on hold.  Fianc\u00e9 Incarnate.  Couldn't pick a worst time, right? Hey, Esm\u00e9e, how about you take off, let me handle this? I couldn't let you do that.  I'll write up the report and e mail it to you for signature.  Okay? I want Morgan to report to me first thing in the morning about that bar fight of hers.  I owe you.  Get in there.  There's somebody else, get in there now.  Pobrecita.  Seeing her mother that way can you imagine that? I can't even go there, Angel.  This one's on us, man.  If I had kid Chino last night that little girl's mother would still be alive.  I gotta find Chino before he finds me.  bringing to an even dozen the number of bodies found off shore.  I have to focus.  Tune everything out.  So far, authorities have no clue as to who that criminal If I don't, being linked to my beautiful bodies at work will be the least of my worries.  Shit! Little Chino.  He was out there.  Timing could be better.  That, plus I don't have my tools, but It does give me the chance to tie up one mess of loose end.  That's you, sergeant.  Who else you got following you? Apparently no one.  Go ahead.  Try it.  I've been waiting.  In this neighborhood? It's full of crazies.  I'd lock my doors.  Bathroom's all yours.  It kind of always was.  We ran out of glasses?   Clean ones.    Come here a sec'.  I found a couple of places on Craig's list that you should check out.  Two bedrooms, two baths, limited water views   It has its own gym.    I hate it.  Alright.  One bedroom, one bath, art deco building? Shitty neighborhood.  It gets morning sun!   Come on, Deb, give it a chance.    Look, Dex, I appreciate the brotherly love, but I've got the lieutenant in like an hour.  See you at the job.  I will not kill my sister RITA CALLING (del vo)   Hey you!   Dexter? Astor? Sweetie, what's the matter? Mum's acting all weird and stuff.  What kind of weird? She keeps talking to people on the phone about my dad, then she starts yelling at them.  Then, she yells at me and Cody.  I'm on my way.  No.  Calm is what I was 35 minutes ago.  Pissed is what I am now.  Hey! Who wants Eggos? I got blueberry or chocolate.  Or both.    Both.    I don't care.  Assholes! They did everything but help.  Which assholes were you talking to? Funeral home assholes.  You're having a funeral for Paul? Not for Paul.  For the kids.  For me.  We had this old insurance policy.  It's about five thousands, but it should cover everything.  You know, the county will bury Paul for free.  I mean He wasn't even your husband.  Any more.  Technically.  Then, you could use the insurance money for a starter scholarship for the kids.  Dexter, I didn't ask for your help or your advice.  I'll never understand how people deal with death.  Why they can't just put it in its place.  Now, I have to find someone who knows I'm looking for him.  Not exactly ideal in the element of surprise department, and I have to find a new way to dispose of Little Chino's body.  If I can close the deal, this time You totally douched me in there.  You clocked a guy in a bar, who touched your arm.  Yeah, I told the lieutenant you weren't ready for active duty.  Well, thank you for the fucking vote of confidence.  Nice.  You know, buzz in the halls is that the Feds are coming in on the Bay Harbor bodies.  Well, that figures.  FBI does all the heavy lifting, Captain Matthews takes all the credit.  Nice political move   when you're buckin' for deputy chief.    Any idea who the FBI's sendin'?   Some guy named Landy.    Frank Landy? He's a rock star.  The Green River killer and the DC sniper? The case was impossible, he broke it.  We're damage goods around here, but you You should do whatever you can to get on Landy's task force.  It's a career maker.  Just visualize that door of opportunity just opening up wide for you.  And just walk right through it.  Angel, you keep up with this whoo hoo shit, I'll walk right through you.  Little Chino Shit! This guy is officially the highest point in all Florida.  But what's he doin' here? People tell me you're lookin' for my client.  People tell you right.  Fuck, he's big! The harder they fall That come with the story? Cut myself shaving.  Well, you should be more careful, amigo.  My client's been repeatedly harassed by this department.    Frankly we considering   Cut the shit, Raul.  There was another murder in East Kendle yesterday and my client Word on the pavement is you're lookin' for me regarding this   Tragedy.    You bet your ass, we are.  The victim was the mother of one of your compadres who we know you killed.    But can't prove.  Right, Officer?   It's \"Detective\".    And can't prove yet.    Show 'em the disc.  Time stamp has this at yesterday afternoon.    Same time as   Eva Renez's TOD.  That's bullshit.  Anyone can reset a time stamp.  Check it out.  Yesterday's paper.  That arrogant prick.  He knew we'd peg him for Elena's murder so he covered his ass, had someone else do the deed.    That makes him an accomplice, right?   Not without evidence.  Cut him loose.  Red Rover, Red Rover send Chino back over.  Dex, check this out.  Thirteen and counting.  They're so swamped up there, they had to bring in outside talent.  Which would be moi.  Bet this guy never expected his work to see the lighta day.  I bet you're right.  Still it can't be easy to hide a body nowadays.  You shittin' me? Hypothetical: you're the Bay Harbor Butcher.  How do you make sure disposed body stays disposed? Tons of options: Everglades, alligators pig farms, sulfuric acid, wood chipper, incinerator.  Hell! Even meat pies.  The mind boggles.  Don't all those run the risk of contact with the outside world? You got a better idea? And that's the problem.  Where do I put Chino when I'm done with him? Captain's comin' up with that FBI guy.  He's got a fuckin' entourage.  So this is the man who stands between me and death row.  Listen up, everyone.  Briefing room in 2 minutes for show and tell.  All right.  The Bay Harbor Butcher case.  is now a Miami Metro case.  And it is shaping up to be the biggest one in our history.  Now it's fourteen confirmed.  The FBI has sent over their top man, Special Agent Frank Landy to help solve this crime.  Now This will not be a jurisdictional circle jerk.  This will be a shining exemple of two agencies working together for the public good.  Agent Landy Hello, everyone.  There is no such thing as the perfect crime.  Not in my experience anyway.  With your help, and with the mistakes this person has made in, or will eventually make, we'll find whoever did this aweful thing.  I need everyone in every department up to speed on what we're doing.  While I review your files and put our task force together.  So, let's get a jump start on the Bay Harbor Butcher.  A moniker which by the way repulses me.  Well, we have something in common.  Someone get the lights? First report from the field had these parts as comin'   from one body.    Actually it's two.  Actually it's two.  There has been speculation that this human harvest might be connected to a case you've recently solved.  But there are several inconsistencies between the two sets of body parts.  Gender, exsanguination specific methods of dissection.  Not to mention my guys deserved it.  The evidence just isn't there to piggy bag this onto the Ice Truck Killer.  We're looking for a different suspect.  All information regarding this case Miss me, brother? I can't afford to lose it like this.  Not with Special Agent Rock Star on my case.  I need to clear the Dex.  And my head.  I'm coming for you tonight, Little Chino.  And this time there won't be any screw ups.  You just simen your CO2 cartridge here.  Put in your tranq dart and that'll rip.  Wham bam lights fucking out.  So gators givin' you trouble, Dex? They ate my puppy.  This sucker You load her up right should take down the goddamn grizzly.  You may have to get closer than you like.  She'll do the job, I promise you that.  So which'll be? Both.  Excellent.  First time? Sort of.  Yeah, I been boxing since I was 10.    Tough neighborhood?   Tough family.  And those were just my sisters.  Want some help? I'm doin' enough damage on my own.  Is that a yes or a no? That was a yes.  It sounded like a no, but Good answer.  First we need to wrap your wrists.  So you don't hurt yourself again.  I'm sorry.  You scared the shit outta me.  How you doin'? How am I doin'? I saw the man I thought I loved.  No, did love.  Up on some goddamn screen.  With a gallery full of women he murdered and cut into pieces.  Don't.  You fuckin' asked.  So how am I doin'? I'm just fine.  I might be playing fast and loose with my father's code, but I don't think Harry would disapprove.  Considering Attaboy, Chino.  A little closer.  Come on, don't get the shakes now.  This is no time for performance anxiety.  I've been waitin' for you.  Take him.  He's there.  I don't know.  I don't know where the fuck he is.  Come out, come out wherever you are, cabron.  We'll be out here all night long if we have to.  You find him, okay? What the hell is wrong with me? Someone's coming.  It's okay, I got you.    Please don't hurt us!   Oh, my God! What the fuck is this? Dexter, don't leave me! Biney!   Don't leave me!   Get in there! Please, don't leave me!   Somebody else get in there now!   Biney! Wait! Don't leave me! Bryan My brother.  Come on, somebody must've seen somethin'.  Seing and talking are 2 different things.  Want me to knock out some doors? Or maybe some heads.  Sorry, I'm late.  What fucking asshole left this here? It's Special Agent Fucking Asshole.    Morgan, right?   We got witnesses to interview.  You seen my brother? Excuse me, sir.  You have a minute? Or three.  Good tea takes time.  What's up, Sergeant? It's about your task force.  I think I can bring something to it, sir.  I've looked into your jacket, sergeant.  You've done some fine work here, in Homicide.    Miami Metro's lucky to have you.    Thank you, sir But I don't think you'd be a good fit for my team.  I thought you just said I was qualified.  I said you've done some fine work in Homicide.  Frankly, sergeant, you're more of a leader than a team member.  I'm not convinced to play well with others.  Can someone clean this shit up? I feel like a jigsaw puzzle missing a piece.  And I'm not even sure what the picture should be.  I've been calling you for hours.  I kinda pulled an all nighter.  I called the station.  I was off the clock.  It's this huge case I'm workin'.  It's It's taking me to places I never thougt I'd go.  What? I've been thinking a lot about Paul's death and how I'm gonna deal with it.  And? First of all, I'm not gonna let the county burry him.  I'm using the insurance money to give Paul a proper funeral.  It's in an hour.  Paul was such a destructive force.  Why can't you just putting behind you? It's about saying goodbye.  Goodbye to him and the grip he had on my life.  It's called moving on.  Go clean yourself up.  The kids are expecting you.    I'm just gonna make you late.    Dammit, Dexter.  I need you there, too.  You have no idea what this feels like.  Just gimme 10 minutes.  Come in.  I can't wait to get another door slammed in my face.  If I lived in this neighborhood, I wouldn't talk to the cops either.  Brave guy like you? It's about survival.  These people have families, kids It's not easy to be talkative when you got the 29th St.  Kings playing whack the witness.  It just takes one, right? That's it! Put that out into the universe.  Alright? Miami Metro! Can we talk to you? Go to hell! Okay, but before we do that, ma'am, can I ask you a few questions? How many is \"a few\"? Three.  But one's a two parter.  Go away before I call the police! We are the fucking police! I am talking to no one with language like that! Look at the bright side.    What bright side?   Comically? We're batting a thousand.  There's something balancing about that kind of consistency.  Goddamn it! Shit! What were you thinking? That you can spray your crap on a police car and get away with it? Get off of me, lady! You wanna fuck me like you fucked that Ice Truck guy? You little deadbeat! We better get every piece of shit! Please! I'll tell you where the shit is! The drugs and shit!   Please, don't shoot me, miss!   Morgan! If I believed in God, if I believed in sin, this is the place where I'd be sucked straight to hell.  If I believed in hell.  Come on, Dexter.  It's alright.   hard story of who this man was.  Born into innocence, as are all of God's children, are truly the living personification of God through the magic of family.  Giving love it was with his children, that he truly flourished.  It was with his children, that he, for all his blemishes, reembraced the perfect innocence.  And that was through his children, that once again, God's smiled on Paul Bennett.  And now, the family will come forward for a few moments of silent prayer.  I hope you find your peace, Paul.  Bye, dad.  I'm so sorry for your loss.  Thank you.  Father.  I'm not sorry.  You're still here.  I never left.  Yeah, you did.  I killed you.  You just took my life.  So, how do I make you go away? Well, you can try doing what these people are doing.  I'm not like them.  Now, if it helps, then I can tell you it's not your fault, what you did to me.  I never said it was.  But you feel it.  How do you know that? It's human nature.  I'm not human.  You're just fucked up.  I need to let you go.  You think it's as simple as that? Nothing's simple.  Does this mean you will be my dad, now? Yeah, we got them.  SWAT did a sweep on some auto shop those animals were using as a front.  Maybe we didn't get them on murder, but we busted their asses on drugs, weapons and money laundering.  Half of them are three strikers, so they're gonna go away forever.  Thanks to officer Morgan.  Hey, something you should know.  Deb pulled her gun on an unarmed boy to get him to give up the gang.  Some kid named Joey Nunez.  Thanks, Angel.  I'll talk to her.  I'll give her one thing, though.  She's in a motherfucking good shape.  Here comes another one.  We got Little Chino too? That cocksucker wasn't there.  It's too bad.  What you got? It's none of your business.  Damn! Excuse me, Esme.  I opened this by mistake.  It said lieutenant.  No worries.  Today, Maria, it is all about the win.  I think we really should enjoy this.  Stop me if you think I'm speaking out of turn, or above my station, but We really don't use the department resources here for personal matters.  What are you talking about? Well, let's, for argument's sake, say those phone records belong to your fianc\u00e9.  It could open a shit ugly can of worms you might not be able to close.  Only if someone mentions it.  This is me not mentioning it.  I'm new at this This.  Not trusting the man that I thought that I loved, and I really appreciate your support.  Hey, Deb.  It's me.  Again.  You're probably at the gym.  Again.  Look, I got some unfinished business outside the office I'll probably be a little late tonight.  I'll catch up with you later.  It was simple, really.  All I had to do was put myself into the mind of a killer.  Hardly a stretch.  It was only a matter of time before Little Chino went after Joey Nunez for snitching them out.  Here's, hoping I'm back on my game.  Trust me, you're not going anywhere this time.  Who the fuck are you? That kind of talk is just gonna bring you closer to your victims.  Who the hell are you? A cop? 'Cause I was cleared of that bitch! No, maybe you didn't do the deed, but her blood is on your hands.  A lot of blood is on your hands.  Why do you care about these people? Actually Fuck!  I don't.  Why are you doing this to me? I'm not so much doing this to you as I'm doing it for me.  What's that? I haven't killed no kid.  But you killed most of her.  Her mother.  Her brother.  Her innocence.  You leave pain wherever you go.  If you kill me, what do you leave behind? A world without you.  Look at that, steady as a surgeon.  This kill was the first of the loose ends I needed to tie off.  I found a newer, safer place to dump my trash.  Moving at over 4 miles an hour, the Gulf Stream is one of the world's most powerful deep water currents.  This time tomorrow, Little Chino will be north of Palm Beach.  After that, it's on to Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, until, eventually Well, let's just say that the North Atlantic's a pretty big place.    Hey, you.    I need to see you.  I was just dropping somebody off, can't it wait? No, it can't.  Alright, then.  A shoe? You want to see me about a shoe? It's Paul shoe.  What do we do with it? Paul kept insisting to me that you knocked him over the head, dragged him to his hotel and shot him with drugs.  Sounds like one of his stories, huh? He asked me to look in the yard for his shoe.  Finally, I did.    Baby   Let me finish, Dexter.  I didn't have a lot to hope for until I met you.  You gave me something, to believe in, when I didn't even believe in myself.  Maybe I was Maybe I was so desperate that I looked to the other way.  Paul begged me to help him.  And what did I do? I hung up on him.  And he was so upset, he got into a prison fight, and he was beaten to death with a pipe.  It's not your fault.  A part of, it is.  A part of me believes that with all of Paul flaws, he paid the price for my dreams.  Did you attack him, Dexter? I'd understand if you did, he attacked me.  I hit Paul to protect you and the kids.  It's totally an act of impulse.  Where did you get the drugs? Stolen from the evidence locker.  Wait.  Wait.  Wait, I mean First you tell me that you acted on impulse, and then you tell me that you stole the drugs from your police station? What are you trying to say, that you planned on acting on impulse? It's all kinda jumbled now How did you know how to cook the heroin? How did you know what dose to give a big guy like Paul? Oh my God.  Oh my God, why didn't I see this? They were your drugs? Now, it makes sense.  That's where you disappeared to at all hours of the night like Clark fucking Kent.  Look, if there is anything, left between us, you'll answer me this one question and you will tell me the truth.  Are you an addict? Yes, I have an addiction.  That's good.  It's the first step.  Admitting you have a problem.  We get you into a program.  We get you the help you need.  And I will be there for you.  If the eyes were a window to the soul, then grief is the door as long as it's closed, it's the barrier between knowing and not knowing.  Walk away from it and it stays closed forever.  But open it, and walk through it, and pain becomes truth.  And now I'm faced with the struggle for my own survival that I always knew was coming.  I've been preparing for this my entire life.  When all is settled down, Chino, you're the same size as everyone else.  Hey Dex, what the fuck? Hang on, I'm coming.  It's annoying, isn't it? I'm not taking the bait.    You're up late.    Yeah, just surfing.  You got to the gym? Then I was sort of driving around.  Around what? Around town.    Because?   Saw some buildings with some \"for rent\" signs.  I'm gonna check them out.  Then, \"Chez Dexter\", can return to its original semi lived in museum quality state.    Deb, you don't need to do this.    Yes, I do.  You don't need to do this now.  And what about the video tours of eligible apartments? Temporary insanity.  You sure? No.  Get out.  Asshole.  This way I can take care of my sister the way Harry would have wanted.  You really wreak.  You right.  I smell like a fucking sewer.    For every door that closes   Fuck.  Sorry.   it was always right there.  I had to say goodbye, in order to reconnect with what's really important with who I was with who I have to be.  Rest in peace I am.      Previous EpisodeNext Episode"

My name is Caroline.    I'm an addict.    Hi, Caroline.  I started taking pain pills after my back surgery.  I don't need them for the pain any more.  Now Now, I just need them.  And I need duct tape, 3 or 4 rolls, running low on heavy duty trash bags Until last time, I sharpened my knives And then, I lost my license, Tears, now? It's very hard to concentrate in here.  How am I supposed to get any work done? My husband says he's gonna leave me if I don't stay sober.  But I have to do this for myself.  \"No self control, lost everything,\" \"trying to stop\".  Same whiney story over and over for ten minutes It feels like 10 hours.  Lortabs, Darvocet Percocet, and anything I could get my hands on.  Even now I'd kill for a Vicodin.    Lightweight?   First hit at narcotics anonymous.  But I don't belong here.  You guys are real addicts.  So, how was the meeting? Tell me everything.  It was interesting, hearing the same story over and over again.    Knowing you're not alone.    Exactly.    Did you get fortune cookies?   Only the ones with the good fortunes.  So did you share or just listen? I just wanted to take it all in my 1st time out.  Think they forgot Here they are! Spring rolls.  What about a sponsor? Did you find one? I didn't want to rush into anything.  It's an important relationship.  Absolutely.  OK, so, let's see your newcomer's chip.  My newcomer's chip? Yeah   You did stay until the end, right?   Of course I did, right till the end.  You're a terrible liar.  I know too much about 12 steps programs to be easily conned, Dexter.  I didn't stay till the end end, if that's what you mean.  I had some important errands to run.  Important? But am I important? Are the kids? Yes, of course.  You just gonna have to figure out how important, 'cause if you don't work the program, and I mean really work it, I just I can't go through this again.  All right, kids.  Dinner.  How important are they? I'm sure someone with a heart could answer that question.  Tomorrow.  I'll go tomorrow.  I'll stay.  Hold the elevator! Thanks.  Nice dodge last night, flooring it through that yellow light.  Were you behind me? See you tonight.  detective will be with you.  How long will we have to We will get to all of you.  Take their names, and keep them out of the bullpen, till we figure this out.  Sue McMillan! She disappeared 4 years ago.  Who are they? Family members of every missing person for the last decade.  Including some sad, lonely and presumably single woman courtesy of Lieutenant Pascal.  It's not her fault.  That reporter's an asshole.  Sergeant? Hold the rest of them downstairs.  We're out of room, here.  Have you seen Pascal? Pascal is just caught in a cycle of reaction.  She's not co creating her own reality.  You know those words don't mean anything, right? Look around you.  She's manifesting negativity.  It's on again.    Lieutenant?   No comment.  Dozens of bodies found   in that underwater grave site.    Not dozens.  The boss' sweater melons look bigger on TV.  The operative word is boss.  Show some respect.  I thought I was.    One dozen, two dozens?   18 or so.    Excuse me.    Have the families been notified? We're still trying to identify them.  Our viewers with information can contact you? Yes.  Fine.  So police are seeking any leads that can help them identify the 18 faceless victims of the Bay Harbor Butcher.  If you have any information Pascal is definitely off her game.  Word is, her fianc\u00e9 is catching some strange in the sly.  That'd do it.  The shit stops here.  Give it to me.  Most of these people won't find answers here.  Chances are good their loved ones weren't among my chosen few.  May I have your attention, please? First of all, I wanna tell you what a great job you've all been doing on this horrific case.  And with the help of the best man hunter in the FBI, we should have answers soon.  In the meantime, the daily work of this precinct must continue to serve the public.  So, we'll be dividing up our resources.  Agent Lundy has requested the following officers for his joint task force.  Officer Cook! Landy made me L. F. I.    L. F. I?   Lead Forensics Investigator.  Sorry you got boned but, hey, no blood spatter.  It sucks to be me.  Actually, it keeps me off Lundy's radar.  Sergeant Lee.  Detective Ramos Officer Panko.    Detective Batista.    Yes! I saw this happening.  And officer Debra Morgan.  Those called'll report directly to Special Agent Lundy.  But let's not forget this is on all of us, folks.  Let's keep our eyes and ears open.  The Ice Truck Killer was an amateur compared to this guy.  I'd also appreciate it if your lieutenant would consult with me before speaking to the press.  I'll rip her a new one, if I can find her.  Prints, fibers, trace evidence.  No, they won't find anything.  I followed all of Harry's painstaking preventative measures.  He knew that nothing stays buried forever.  His code will protect me.  Still, I wish my own sister weren't hunting me, makes for an awkward family dynamic.  So I'm a fed.  My suit proves it.  The other suits here are feds.  But, suit or ugly Hawaiian shirt, no offense, we're a team.  And our first play is IDing those bodies.  Once we know who they are, we'll fill in every detail of their lives.  From their huevos rancheros to their cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e.  And get used to food references because I like food.  Mr.  Masuka and his team're gathering DNA, prints and dental records.  The rest of us are going call through cold cases and missing persons\u0092 files.  Also, I want that crowd out there interviewed.  Though most of them'll be a waste of time.  He has negative thinking.  You four, move them out as quickly as you can.  But be thorough.  If we get even one hit, it'll be worth it.  Everyone else work the files.  Remember, IDs will lead to a pattern, which will lead to our man.  When the manhunt is on, the hunted go shopping.  Not for a new car.  For my next project.  I won't act on it yet.  I'm still laying low, Harry would insist on that.  Just getting the research out of the way.  Someone talked his way into the homes of two women and didn't leave till they were dead.  Ann Cohen, and a month before her, Lynn Hall.  A certain car dealership ran credit checks on both women.  Both bought cars elsewhere, so nobody thought about it twice.  But who requested those credit checks? Roger Hicks.  All I need is some DNA proof.  A cup of coffee should do the trick.  How many kids you got? Enough I hear you.  When my two came along, it was bye bye convertible.  Of course, they're worth it.  Must have taken after their mom.  That they do.  Thank God! Yeah, I tell you I miss my convertible but the truth, my minivan's got a much nicer ride.    So, you own one?   The same one you're looking at.  I know, whipped, right? But my kids love the twin DVDs.  They're crazy about Sponge Bob.  You see?   Actually, I do.    My wife loves the NAV system and all the safety features, and when they're happy   You're happy.    That's right.  Except the kids and the wife don't exist.  And he owns a Beemer, not to minivan.  Still, he's seemless.    Impressive.    It's not flashy, but What did flash ever get me? Get me pulled over, that's what.  I'm definitely not in the flash.  You gotta sit in the captain chair, though.  It's like a 747, man.  Manuel, hold up! Thank you, sir.  So We should take it out.    Check out the ride.    No, I'm just doing research.  OK, you don't want a big sales pitch, I get that.  Let me at least pull the specs for you.  Because, truthfully, we have a hard time keeping these on the lot, you might wanna grab the test drive while it's still here.  I think I have all the information I need to make a decision.  Then, you've seen the Stow&Go seating system, right? I have had everything in here from a soccer team, to a freaking deer carcass.  It was an accident, of course.  But I sure was glad for the ample cargo space.  Not to mention the tainted windows.  I can see how that might come in handy.  I'll just grab the keys.  I go to stalk a killer and I end up with a new car   How did that happen?   New car? You're getting married? Not that I know of.  So what's with the mommy mobile? I'm not sure.  Synthetic Even Roger's hair is a lie.  I could learn a thing or two from this guy.  Who's your daddy? Harry Morgan.  Dude, the lead forensics investigator of the joint task force.  That's who.    So, you want in on this bitch or not?   What bitch? The only bitch in town, baby.  The Bay Harbor Butcher.  I got you temporarily assigned.    You didn't have to.    Nothing sexy, of course, just some bone marrow collection for DNA IDs.  But it'll get you in the tent.  And you gotta see the tent.  Amazing! Say it.    You're my daddy.    It sounds weird when you say it.  I haven't been much use, since he disappeared.  I know I'm supposed to move on But Here's a picture of him.  He looks nice.  Not according to my mother.  Or the police.  He was in and out of jail.  But my heart raced whenever I saw him.  I brought his toothbrush.  They say you can get DNA off it.  You can find him with this, right? Look, thanks for choosing me for the task force and all, but I'd appreciate you finding someone else.    You want off?   Just as soon as you can replace me, sir.  This is a chance to solve a pretty important case.  Most people get into this line of work to do just that.  I've got cases of my own backing up, and the precinct's shorthanded with all this shit, so, if you don't mind I'll see what I can do.  In the meantime, if you could continue the interviews Yeah, of course.  Thank you.  Most of them have been underwater for years, but some It's awesome, you can't even tell.  The temperature in the ocean floor and the airtight bags kept them intact.  I mean a little gelatinous residue sure, but I'd rather remember my old playmates as they were.  Neat, clean little packages.    I appreciate the favor, Vince, but   Actually, you're doing me the favor.  I need your help, buddy.  The pressure's fucking ridonkulous.  Glad to be of service.  Field morgue, for the overflow, but it's state of the art.  Fucking FBI, hey? A good percentage is just bones, Must have fed the fish when the bags tore.  Humpty fucking Dumpty, right? Exactly.  They weren't meant to be put together again.  They were meant to remain in the silent shadows, keeping their secrets.  Now, they're exposed to the glare, reflecting my darkness like some grotesque carnival mirror.  Harry was right.  Nothing stays buried.  Perhaps, not even me.  Looking for my Taurus, Sergeant? Keep looking.  You don't need to know where I'm going tonight.  and, genius me, not only do I leave my works in my girlfriend's car, but also all the dead fish from the fishing trip, right? Then I collapse in her parents' house, scare her kids, and get myself fired, 'cause guess what We work together.  So now, I'm 20 day sober, again, hoping to make it to 21.  Thanks, Gordon.  This meeting recognizes lengths of sobriety with chips.  So If there's anyone who'd like a newcomer's chip You've got 3 minutes to share if you want it.  Really? Go ahead.  You among friends.  Well, I What's your name? Hi, Bob.  And I'm a an addict.  I use heroine.  Shoot it.  It's affecting my job.  My boss found my works.  He fired my ass.  But I showed him.  I spent every penny on my final paycheck on junk.  And doctor said I I almost died.  Coffee sucks.  As bad as the doughnuts.  It's better next door.  Come on.  It is good coffee.  Thank you.  So tell me exactly how full of shit are you? I'm not full of anything.  It was a nice performance in there.  Where did you download it? From Addict. com? Look, I have no reason to lie.  Sure you do.  We all do.    You thought I was lying?   I don't know Well, it is anonymous.  Everyone in that room, has heard or lived far worse than anything you've ever done.  I doubt it.  So, you're super junky.  I don't mean to imply that what you've been through hasn't been difficult.  But there is no way that I could know what you've experienced, right? I couldn't possibly feel that need.  Like a thousand hiding voices whispering \"This is who you are\" And you fight the pressure.  The growing need rising like a wave.  Prickling and teasing and prodding to be fed.  But the whispering gets louder, until it's screaming \"Now!\".  And it's the only voice you hear.  The only voice you want to hear.  And you belong to her.  To this shadow self.  To this Dark passenger.  The dark passenger.  I'm sorry, but I need to go.  Thanks for the coffee.  She knows.  She recognizes demons, dark passengers Maybe the others can too.  This program is too risky.  Especially now.  Rita will have to understand.  You just missed story time.  I was at a meeting.  Thank you.  It made me realize something important.  Really? What's that? Those meetings are not a good place for me.  I know how this sounds, but I can do this on my own.    You need a program.    I've read studies, people are ten times as likely to change on their own as they are   with the help of doctors or programs.    So, you're quoting studies? I lived this.  I watched Paul try and fail with white knuckle sobriety.  I'm not Paul.  I'm not any of those people.  Going to those meetings, will do more arm than good.  I swear to you.  I'm better off, alone.  I pray you change your mind.  What just happened? I though you were staying at Rita's.  I'm taking the night off.  I though you'd be on the treadmill.  Taking the night off.  With no money down, guaranteed, or we'll make your first two payments A night off is good to remember what's important.  Two women are dead.  The killer is selling minivans and I have an opportunity to prove it.  Even if I am laying low.  Having a victim prepped and ready will take the edge off the wait I hope.  Hang on a second, OK? What's going on, Dex? Any problems, the service center can take care of you,   but they're around the corner.    Actually, the minivan's fine.  Yes, I'd never sell a lemon.    I'm rethinking the extended warranty.    I'll ask the warranty writer.  I'm thinking roof rack and premium sound system.  Going all out.  That's great.  But I'm with a customer and so One of my associates will take care of you.  I'll just wait for you in your office.  DNA, DNA, come out and play.  Roger's got you in a box.  Once you're in a box you don't leave without a deal.  Don't worry, you're safe with Roger, he's the best.  I'm just dropping off this thank you note.  I was just leaving.  He sent you across the street, didn't he?   Across the street?   He told me not to tell anyone too.  I don't know how he makes a living sending all of his commissions to other dealers.  Maybe he has ulterior motives.  Or maybe he knows I can't afford this price.  After he ran a credit check? TRW doesn't lie.  So, you're single? Makes it tougher to afford those big ticket items like cars houses.  You rent an apartment? A house.  I hate sharing walls, you hear everything.  Tell me about it.  No pets though, right? Is this a come on? 'Cause it's a little weird.  Must be why I'm still single.  Another brunette.  Single, neighbors out of distance.  No guard dog.  The credit check gives Roger all the details he needs.  She's next.  And I can't do anything about it.  Not until this manhunt ends.  Harry would insist on it.  What? I'll take care of it.  I know the card is in his name.  I just wanna check the charges.  Well this supervisor I spoke with this morning allowed it.  Yeah, I'll hold.  Yes? Just to remind you that the Biscayne drive by warrant needs your approval.  I'll look at it.  And the homicide that came in last night still need to be assigned.  Right.  Thanks.  I know things are awful with your fianc\u00e9 right know, and I'm sorry.  But we need to keep clearing that board out there.  You're right, I'm sorry.  I seem to have had my head up my ass, lately.  It's called being human.  OK, who's up?   Samuels and Kent are up.    Put them on the liquor store shooting.  And where is the Biscayne warrant? Right here.  Simps and Hoagy want SWAT for entry? I think it's a good cautionary measure given the weapon charge.  Excuse me, I'm gonna need a minute.  Just gonna need a minute.  I'll handle it.  You're not taking my calls and now you're checking my credit card charges? Roger's DNA matches the semen found at both crime scenes.  Irrefutable.  If I do nothing, another woman dies.  Is that my long dormant conscience talking? Or the dark passenger whispering? Hi, it's me.  Hi, Dexter.  Kids home from school yet? Colleen's bringing them home now.  I'm a little confused.  I'm sorry you're confused.  It is pizza night, shall I pick up the usual? Did you go back? To a meeting? Thinking about it.  The kids and I will order in, then.  So This is it? It's up to you, Dexter.  I want to know where is she.  M\u00ed Teresita, she's so young.  Seven year old.  You heard me.    I know you find her.    We'll do what we can.  Don't cry.  Only English.  Angel! Just tell her we'll call her.  She thinks you can find her daughter.  But there are no kids down there.  Tell her I can't help her.  I can't help you.  It's been 24 hours since I asked to be replaced.  Has it? What's taking so long? Every cop on the damn force wants in on this case, just take your pick.  I've been wondering about that, actually.  Everyone wants on but you want off.  I told you I've cases.  I don't think so.  Jesus, I just don't wanna be on your task force, alright? Why? Because I'm the last person in the world that should be on it.  You want me to find a serial killer? I was engaged to one, for Christ's sake! What kind of cop   What kind   That's why I chose you, you know.  Because of what you went through.  You survived.  I don't know how.  I can't begin to imagine the strength it took, continues to take.  More than that, you got a first hand look into the mind and heart of a killer.  And you're still here.  If you can accept that, really accept it, you could use it.  Mix that with some of your strength and you could catch someone even worse than the Ice Truck Killer.  But you have to stop running.  Finish today's interviews.  Then if you still want out, you got it.  Lead fucking investigator.  I do have a life, you know.  You do? Just give me a bone marrow DNA results.  No matches.  Big surprise.  Do me a favor on your way out, OK? Drop these dental X rays at the morgue for me.  Tech should still be there.  Fucking Bay Harbor butcher's butchering my online social life.  Sorry.  I figured you'd still be here.  You were a pain in the ass, but always a damn hard worker.  And of course, you knew how to handle the press.  Come here a minute.  The public needs to believe that we can protect them when all hell breaks loose, so I need all my people operating at their highest levels.  I agree.  Should I be worried about Pascal? Why? You can cut the crap, Maria.  I know she's been AWOL on personal matters.  The press fuck up is huge.  And I'm beginning to hear rumors about erratic behavior.    You're asking me because?   Because you've done the job.  So she is out, that means you're back in.  That makes you her harshest critic and I want it straight.  Take your shot.  You know what \"erratic\" means? It's code, for non male.  This is the same bullshit sexism I put up with when I was in charge.  I won't dignify rumors, captain.  Pascal's fine.  Minivan's that way.  Field morgue's this way.  I'll wait.  You should take the night off, sergeant.  On pizza night? No way.  What's that girlfriend of yours seeing in a freakshow like you anyway?   You have to ask her.    Maybe I will.  What exactly is it you think I've done? I know you're connected to the Ice Truck Killer.    Could you be more vague?   I know you're too careful.  Your assets are all in cash, you don't belong to any organizations or alumni groups.  You were top of your class in med school but you changed for blood spatter.  I know you studied martial arts in college.  But I don't know what a lab geek needs with advanced Jiu Jitsu.  Do you know what an easy credit is? I know you're a good liar too.  Not good enough.  Sergeant Doakes thinks he knows my secrets.  But he only needs to look at this, my body of work,   to know the real me.    Suit up if you gonna touch them.  I'm just dropping off some X rays.    I'm Dexter Morgan.    I know who you are.  Right.  Looks like the lab tech's gone home for the night, so I'll just You hoping they'll talk to you? The ones with heads, anyway.  They always speak, eventually.  Just gotta ask the right question.  Which is? Why were they chosen? Looking for a pattern? One doesn't kill this many people in this careful, methodical way without a reason.  Some twisted set of principles.  They would have to be twisted, wouldn't they? The worst killers are usually the ones who think their murders were somehow just.  Even deserved.  Leaders have slaughtered whole populations for the same wacky reason.  But there's never any justification for killing.  Well, one, of course.  To save an innocent life.  To save an innocent life.  How many more bodies would there be, had I not stopped those killers? I didn't do it to save lives.  But save lives, I did.  Motivation aside, I think Harry and Lundy would agree on this one.  Roger the artful dodger.  You scared me, bro.  We have some unfinished business.  Right, the warranty and stuff.  Listen, I can't write you up now, the wife's waiting for me.  Not married.    Ex, I gotta take the kids.    You don't have any.    They're hers.    Nope.  OK, what about this one? I don't give a shit! Neither do I.  You were right about the ample cargo space.  Where am I? Looks different under plastic but you've spent an evening here.  With Ann Cohen.  You took her last breath from her right over there, you remember? You're wrong, I wouldn't! No, you would, and you did and you're about to do it again, that's why we're here.  No, this is crazy.  You've got the wrong guy, I I sell cars, for God's sake.  I've never hurt anyone in my life, definitely not a woman.    Why can't I do that?   Do what? Lie like that.  When I thought I was good, but you, it's I don't lie! OK, that one was weak.  Hey, look.  Any car in the lot, it's yours.  T bird, town car, you name it.  Yours.  Free.  I'll call it in right now.    Lot's closed.    I'll have it opened.  I'm the manager.    The manager is Rick Boxton.    But I've been there longer than him.    You've been there 3 months.    At the other lot.  It's like watching someone ski moguls.  You just hop from one lie to the next, no shame, no embarrassment, you just don't give a shit.  That's the key, right? Not to care about anyone   or anything.    I care.    I care a lot.    It was a compliment.    I don't care either.    Yes, you do.    Like about your wife.    Not married.  Girlfriend, then.  I saw it the minute you walked on the lot.  What did you see? Tell me.  Most guys of your age, they beeline Right through the horse power.  You know, something flashy, sexy.  But you, you there all alone, no one there to nag you, and you don't even glance at the coupes.  The only thing you look at is the minivan.  Like you can see her in the passenger seat,   and the kids in the back.    Leave the kids out.  You're lying to yourself if you think you don't care.  She's just a companion really.  It started that way, anyway.  Someone who looked good, normal.    They worm their way in.    Yeah, they do.  And they shut you out.  That's what this is about? That she shut you out? OK, I get it.  I've been there.  But you can't let her get to you like this.  'Cause they're all the same.  Fucking bitches.  You do everything for them, and then they fuck you.  She's not worth it! You're better off without that cunt! Don't talk that way about my girlfriend.  I'm Dexter.  And   I'm not sure of what I am.    Hi, Dexter.  I just know there is something dark in me.  And I hide it.  I certainly don't talk about it.  It's there, always.  This dark passenger.  And when he's driving, I feel Alive.  Half sick with the thrill, the complete wrongness I don't fight him.  I don't want to.  He's all I've got.  Nothing else could love me.  Not even especially not me.  Or is that just a lie the dark passenger tells me? Because lately, there are these moments when I feel connected, to something else.  Someone.  It's like the mask is slipping.  Things, people, who never mattered before are suddenly starting to matter.  It scares the hell out of me.  Hello.  That's all the time we have for sharing.  Would someone lead us in the serenity prayer? I knew there was something wrong with you.  The secrets, the sneaking around Now it all makes sense.  A lot of cops been where you are.  The booze, the drugs.  It makes the job go down easier.  Stay clean and stay out of my way.  And we won't have a problem.  And you owe me a new Michelin, you motherfucker.  I have all your forms so we'll do what we can to bring your dad home.  I'm sorry, you don't understand.  I don't want him home.  Just tell me he's dead.  We need to know he's gone.  Alright.  You want closure.  I want peace.  He made our lives a living hell.  When he'd go to prison, it was a blessing, but.  you kept letting him out.  I need to tell my mother, my sister that they're safe.  That he's rotting in hell.  Call me when you can tell me that.  Lundy, wait! I think it could be a coincidence but, there are 2 of them.  Two? Missing people with records, prison records.  Interesting.  And who typically has a prison record? I don't know.  Bad guys? Bad guys.    Do you think it could be   A pattern? Maybe.  We'll run all the victims' DNA against the criminal database.  DC lab is still open.  Come on.  Let's get to work.  Dexter, what? You were right.  I'm sorry to wake you up, but I had to let you know that you were right.    About what?   The program It's It's good, it's really good.  I am always so in my head.  But this, it was good.  In fact it's already helped me a lot.  Thank you.  I do love this car.  I thought you might.  So, I will pick you up in an hour.  We'll go some place nice for lunch.    Here's my sponsor.    Really? Where? The guy in the blue shirt? No, next to him.  Laila.  I'm back.

        "script": "Previously on \"Dexter\" Two treasure hunters made a ghastly discovery today when they stumbled on what appears to be an underwater graveyard in a crevice off the coast of Miami.  Agent Lundy has requested the following officers for his joint task force.  We're a team, and our first play is IDing those bodies.    I'm Dexter Morgan.    I know who you are.    Hoping they'll talk to you?   They always speak.  You just got to ask the right question.  Harry was right.  Nothing stays buried, perhaps not even me.  Should I be worried about Pascal?   And you're asking me because?   Because you've done the job.  If she's out, it means you're back in.  I won't dignify rumors, captain.  Pascal's fine.  You need to, wrap your wrists so you don't hurt yourself again.  I'm sorry.  We'll get you into a program, we'll get you the help you need, and I will be there for you.  I'm Dexter, and I'm not sure what I am.  Everyone in that room has heard or lived far worse than anything you've ever done.    I doubt it.    How full of shit are you? The mask is slipping.  People who never mattered before are suddenly starting to matter.  Didn't your tour in the army include some special op in haiti?   There's my sponsor.    Really? Where? Just as the worst heat wave in years hits Miami, the heat is also on me.  It's week three of the Bay Harbor Butcher investigation, and superduper special agent Lundy has yet to throw up his hands and say, \"Wow, this guy's good.  \"I give up. \" Dexter, please.    You want me to help?   No, I just need you to move.  I'm sorry.  It's just, you know, my mother's coming today.  I certainly do.  I haven't seen her in so long, and I just want everything to be nice.  We kind of ended things on bad terms.  She and Paul didn't get along.  A lot of people and Paul didn't get along.  Yeah, but I I think she's willing to put that behind us.  She heard about Paul's passing.  She wanted to come and be supportive.  That sounds promising.  Absolutely.  You'll like her, Dexter.  She's great.  She's a very strong woman.  I'll keep that in mind in case I have any heavy lifting to do.  It's too hot.  I know, honey.  Hopefully it'll cool down soon.  Did you sleep any better last night? More nightmares? What was it, the big scary ghost or the alligator? No, the Bay Harbor Butcher.    Oh, honey.    He would never hurt you.  But I'll let you in on a secret.  My sister, Debra, who is a secret police agent ninja warrior, said he only kills bad people, and you're not a bad person, are you? Then you're quite safe.  Why don't you go get dressed, and I will make you some breakfast, okay? It makes me so angry that there's some monster out there scaring my son.    I got to go to work.    You know, I hope they catch him today.  And I'm not a violent person, but I hope they hurt him.  Have a good day.  Make up your mind.  In our most paranoid moments, we fear that everyone is talking about us.  That's become my reality.  I can't hear what they're saying, but I know it's not nice.  Alright, let's get started.  We have positive IDs on all 18 of our complete bodies.  Organized crime.  No connection to organized crime, no mutual gang affiliation either.  But all thirteen were either tried for murder or at least suspected of murder.    Still, you have your pattern.    Yes, we just don't know what it means.  I think we go out with this news immediately.  What news? The news that our serial killer is only killing the dregs of society.  That good, moral people have nothing to fear.  But, captain, that's all This is the only lead we have.  We need to keep it tightly wrapped.  Last night, an elderly man shot his son when he came home late.  Thought it was the Bay Harbor Butcher.  We've got a city in chaos here, Frank.  I understand you wanting to reassure the people.  Good.  Then we're in agreement.  Dex, I got this huge break in the Bay Harbor case.  Bullshit.  I mean, really? Guys, guys! You are not gonna I refuse to believe that Vince Masuka is the man who single handedly brings me down.  I also know denial is the first stage of the grieving process for those who learn they're going to die.  I need to find out what Masuka knows, but I've got to be calm and centered And focused.  Time for a visit to my sponsor.  I need help.  Hi! Hey! Just a minute!   Hope I'm not interrupting anything.    No.  Glad you called.  Just give me a minute.  Yeah, have a look around.  So, I was gonna go and get some art supplies.  Is that alright? Do you want to come?   Yeah, I'm just on my lunch break.    Excellent.  Why are they eating each other? Don't know.  Ask them.  Do you like the heat? Not really.  I'm partial to air conditioning.  I love it.  It makes me feel like the whole world could explode at any moment.  That's a pleasant thought.    Is there an art store near here?   So, you been using? Using what? No drugs.  Perfectly clean.  Look what we have here! Jesus.  What are you Come on.  Are you gonna help or what? That was a little weird.  So, if you're perfectly clean, why'd you call? I  I'm under a lot of pressure at work.  I was hoping you could maybe give me some quick tips on how to deal with the urges.  There are no quick tips.  I see.  Someone's gonna hear that.  They'll think it's the wind.  I thought we were getting art supplies.  That's exactly what we're doing.  I work with found art.  It's more like stolen art.  Is this what a sponsor normally does on their 1st meeting? I don't know.  I've never sponsored anyone before.    Really?   Yeah, but don't worry.  I've had all kinds of sponsors.  Learned from the best.  You do realize I work with the police department? If we get caught, you can flash your badge.  I don't have a badge.  I have a laminate.  Could we talk about why I called you? Yeah, sure.  You want help.  So, tell me.  Why do you use? Why? I don't know.  It's just part of who I am.  And who are you? I'm a bad person.  You haven't got the first idea who you are, have you? Dexter, meet Dexter.  I'm gonna help the two of you get to know each other.  That doesn't really seem necessary.  The first step to recovery is accepting who you are.  I thought the 1st step was admitting you have a problem.  And before you can accept who you are, you have to know who you are.  So that's our first job.  You're going to tell me all your deepest, darkest secrets.  There is something off about him, Harry.  You know why.  Alright, look.  It wouldn't hurt to have him tested, would it? Just a sec.  I got to get back.  Dead body.  How many times have you used that one before? So, the husband's name is Barnes, B A R N E S.    What do we have?   Hello, Dexter.  Gunshot victim, Alisha Barnes, 36.  I heard there may be some big break in the Bay Harbor Butcher case.  Could be.  A neighbor heard her argue with her husband last night, Curtis Barnes.    Masuka was pretty excited about it.    Husband's car is gone.    Nobody knows where he is.    What did they find? Can we concentrate on this case here, please? Sure.  The killer was standing right about where you are, sergeant Doakes.  Two shots to the chest.    I only see one hole in the chest.    Yes, they're that close together.  Very impressive shooting.  It looks like the bullets took nearly identical exit paths, judging from the spray.  And this was all topped off by a final shot to the head.    She was \"mozambiqued\".    What? Triple tapped.  Shit.  I'm guessing this is Curtis Barnes.  Here he is in what looks like Somalia, Afghanistan, a Russian grenade, a Kurdish dagger, and tell me that shit wasn't stolen from Saddam's palace.    What are you saying?   I'm saying asshole's special ops.  There's no doubt about it.  They're generally known for settling their arguments so peaceably.  Don't get smug with me.  Sounds like we're in your world, James.  Yeah, I'll take lead on this one.    Pick a body.    Sir? I want you each to pick a body.  This is where the case is going to be made.  We have 13 suspected murderers, and then we have these gentlemen.  Robert Thatcher, janitor for the school district with no criminal record.  Marcus White, tow truck driver, no criminal record.  And this this is Oscar Sota.  What's his story? Naval engineer for the port of Miami, member of the stewardship council of St.  Tarsicia catholic church, married, loved, respected.  But he was found in a bag under the sea with 13 killers.  Why? Answer that question, then we really know something.  I got him.  Oscar Sota.  Why did the killer cut them up like this?   Ease of disposal.    Or for fun.  You don't kill this many people because it's a chore.  You do it 'cause you like it.  Great.  Tomorrow.  The Barnes case? Yeah, that was a buddy from special ops.  He says Curtis Barnes is still in Miami.  The only part of that that I find surprising is that you have a buddy.  It turns out Barnes and I both were ranger RRD.  Regimental Reconnaissance Detachment.  Guys you're not supposed to know about, who get in before everybody else.    A brother in arms.    Something like that.  My buddy put me in touch with a guy from Curtis' unit.    He's willing to talk to me.    Good.  I got your blood report.  It's all pretty straightforward.    I'd be careful, though.    Why is that? The trajectory of the bullets are level, exact same angle of origin.  All 3 shots were fired in less than 1 sec.  Very impressive shooting.  I need you to run some tests on this shirt.    Is there blood?   No blood.    I'm really the blood guy.    It's a smell.  It smells like a woman.  Which part? Who can identify this for me? You know, that's really Masuka's area.  He's definitely your man.  Thanks.  Anything I can do to overburden Masuka is to my advantage.  Trust me, I'm not above sending pizzas and hookers to his house in the middle of the night.  Well, everything's unpacked.  The back bedroom's small, but it's quieter.  I'm just happy to be here, that's all.    You're always welcome.    Am I?   I wasn't sure.    Of course you are.  All these years without an invitation.  I thought you didn't want to come.    You and paul   Nonsense.  I wasn't gonna let that keep me away from my daughter and my grandchildren.  But you did let it keep you away.  Let's not assign blame, Rita.  Nothing good ever comes of that.  We'll just have to make up for lost time, that's all.    Hi.    Hey.    Dexter, this is my mother.    Gail.    So nice to meet you.    Nice to meet you, too, Dexter.  I've always been good with parents.  The key is to simply think of them as aliens from a distant universe.  \"You have fibers and threads unknown to us.  \"Your ancient customs intrigue me. \" So, Dexter, tell me everything there is to know about you.  You have made me your sworn enemy, evil woman.  I work in the forensics department for the Miami Metro P. D. , and I'm very fond of your daughter.  Good answer.  I'm also very fond of my daughter.    You did a good job raising her.    30 years as a schoolteacher.  I've got a little experience with children.  And I see a young man who is not eating.  I'm not hungry.  He's scared the butcher's gonna get him.  Well, remember, he only gets bad people.  I was bad, today.  I threw a ball at Tommy Alvarez.  Well, that's not too bad, and anyway, the Bay Harbor Butcher doesn't hurt kids.    He doesn't?   Definitely not.  You're safe.    They should hurry to catch him.    They are working as hard as they can.  If what I've heard is true, that he only goes after criminals, I say leave him alone.  He's got my seal of approval.  Perhaps I have misjudged you, oh wise one.  Really? Yeah, sister spilled everything.  Thinks he killed their parents and made it look like a car accident.  The living trust was in his name.  Nice work.  So, what's it gonna be tonight? Chinese?   Italian?   Actually, I have a social appointment.  You mean a date? I guess you could call it that.  Look at you.  New in town and already hooking up.  It's an introduction arranged by a friend.  One needs to get out and have a little fun on occasion.  It's something I strongly recommend for you as well.    Yeah.  With the hours we work   I'm serious.  Make time for it.  It'll help keep you better balanced.  Yes, sir.  Are you okay? Yeah, it's just something at work.  Are you handling it okay? I ended up seeing my sponsor today at lunch.  How'd that go? Not so great.  She's a little odd.  Plays a little loose with the 12 steps.  That doesn't seem smart, making up your own.  Maybe it's 'cause it's her first time being a sponsor.  Maybe you should try someone else.  I just want to do what's best for my recovery.  Well, maybe someone older, more like you, more manly.  Yeah, maybe.  Yeah.    Hey.    Hey.  You remember me? Yeah.    You're the girl who doesn't like tape.    Debra, actually.  I'm Gabriel.    Done for the night?   Yeah.  Any interest in grabbing a drink? Usually, a lady has to buy me dinner first.  Stop talking and get your pants off.    Are you always like this?   No.  No, I haven't even had sex since Since what? You all right?   Yeah, just 1 sec.    We don't have to do this, you know? You're into the kinky stuff, huh? No, the last guy I had sex with tried to kill me.  \"Who is the bay harbor butcher?\" God.  This obsession with him is relentless, just like Deb and that damn treadmill.  Deb, do you ever stop? Dexter, you're supposed to be at Rita's! Sorry.  Fuck.  Good morning.  So, that was a little weird last night.  No, yeah.  Well It was dark.  My eyes hadn't adjusted.  All I could see were shadows.  Well, lease put those shadows out of your mind.  So, what's this big break in the bay harbor butcher case   I keep hearing about?   Algae.    Algae?   Yeah.  Masuka found microscopic algae inside the garbage bags with the bodies.  Algae under the sea Imagine that.  How does that help? 'Cause there are over 100,000 species, all different.  Vince thinks it'll help to find in which harbor the killer keeps his boat.  He's got some marine biologists coming down to take a look.  Can you imagine something so little being the thing that breaks this case? I gotta go.  I'll see you at the station.  It doesn't make sense.  If there's algae on my victims, it would have to come from the ocean where I dumped them.  Obviously, I'm missing something and I don't like that.  Mrs.  Sota, I understand you wanting to protect your husband's reputation, but I also have to tell you that your cooperation can help us catch a serial killer.    I am cooperating.    You haven't told me anything.  'Cause there's nothing to tell! Maria.  You off to meet the man from Curtis' unit?   Yeah, at the Blue Wing Marina.    You have backup? Oh, yeah, all kinds of backup.  Helicopters and shit.  Listen, we got a missing murder suspect.  This guy's a friend of his.  I'm just gonna go talk to him.  Right.  You're the lone holdout.  Every other suspect has a criminal past, and not just any criminal past.    They were all linked to murder.    Oscar never murdered anybody.  Then why was he killed? Maybe he found out who the serial killer is! OK, so your husband is an engineer and a secret crime fighter.    Are you through?   You're gonna tell me what he did.  Oh, no.  You are through.  Just what I needed.  Hello? You Doakes? I am.  And I guess you're not gonna tell me your name.  I'm Curtis Barnes.  I checked you out.  We know a lot of the same people.  Everyone says I can trust you.  You can trust me.  I just need 48 hours.  I got somebody to take me to Cuba, but it'll take a day to get the papers I need.    So, what are you asking?   Stall the investigation.  Let me ask you one question.  Yeah.  Did you kill your wife? Yeah.  I killed Alisha.  Turn around.    Turn the fuck around!   No, you are not arresting me!   Put the gun down and turn around!   I don't think so.  So, how'd your social appointment go last night? Oh, you know I took your advice.  My advice? To get out and have some fun.  Got laid big time.  Well I mean I don't usually just go to the gym and pick up strangers.  The gym? You have to save me here, or I'm gonna go outside and shoot myself.  The way you're going, you'd probably miss.  Thanks.  My date was horrible.  I picked her up and I don't know Miami, of course, so I got us completely lost.  And she's chattered away the whole time about a yogi master I just have to meet, so by the time we got to restaurant, I had tore my hair out.    God.  I'm sorry.    No, it was good.  It was a reminder that I shouldn't be dating.  Of course you should be.  It all comes down to simple mathematics.  A really beautiful relationship is a once in a lifetime thing, And I've already had mine.  Hey, so, I heard you found some algae that might help crack the big case.    You heard right.    What kind of algae? Diatoms.  Eukaryotic algae.  Okay, this is the first time I regret not being a bigger nerd.    Eukaryotic?   I'll let Manny explain it to you.  He's picking up the evidence tomorrow so he can study it in his own lab.  You know marine biologists, Real prima donnas.    Any chance you could show me?   Masuka.  Up front.  Oh, no.  It's that crazy witch.  What is this shit? I told you to find a smell.  How fucking hard can that be?   Look, I told you, a smell isn't   It smells like another woman.  I can smell it! Why can't you? This man is ruining my life, and you all go on like nothing is happening! Come on.  This is the kind of thing that makes me glad I have no feelings.  Like they always say, never take your dirty laundry to work.  We can stand here all day, I don't give a fuck, but you'll put that gun down.  Now, we were both rangers.  That bond goes deep.  That doesn't mean anything to you? If you weren't a ranger, I'd have shot your ass by now.  You killed your wife, man.  I didn't mean to.  It happened, man.  You married? Ever? Once.  She dropped your ass, didn't she? What? Got tired of you punching holes in the walls, waking up in the middle of the night screaming? Was she always yelling, \"You gotta get help\"? So she sends you to some doctor, but you don't go, 'cause you know there's no help for this kind of fucked up.  And finally, she can't take it anymore and she just says \"adi\u00f3s. \" That sound about right? You got it wrong, man.  I left her.  And why was that? 'Cause I was afraid if I didn't, I'd kill her.  Let's take the boat out.    Why would we want to do that, man?   We'd get out of this heat, for one.  Nice ocean breeze.  Maybe head toward Cuba.  Come on, just get me to within sight.  I could swim from there.    Once I'm there, I could find the   You're wasting your time.  You're going back to the station with me.  No.  I'm not going to prison.    I didn't mean to kill her.    It's the only way out of here.  Can't get you to reconsider? Not a chance.  Well, that's too bad 'cause like I said   I'm not going to prison.    Put the fucking gun down, Curtis.  Don't make me do it! Motherfucker.  You gonna tell me how you're doing? I'm fine.  Come on, dex.  Open up.  Very fine? You're gonna have to do better than that.  What's going on inside your head? What are you thinking? I'm afraid we're Done You and I.  Serious? You're breaking up with me? Actually, I don't think I want to answer any more questions.  Listen, Dexter, whatever you think is right is wrong.  He asks you a question, I want you to think of your answer first and then tell him the exact opposite, okay? So, let's just jump in, all right? Does it make you angry when your teachers tell you what to do? Are you often bored? Have you ever killed an animal? No.  Never.  I should get back to work.  Thanks for everything.  I heard about Pascal's little meltdown.  She's been under a lot of stress.    You're still doing it.    What's that? Sticking up for her.  She is my superior.  You know, I may have misjudged you, Maria.  Maybe you are more than a political animal.  You just might be a real cop.  That's what I've been trying to tell you.  You're back in charge of homicide, effective immediately.  Thank you.  Pascal just set women in the department back 20 years.  It's up to you to turn that around.  There it is, like a gigantic white whale.  My moby dick.  Man, this heat.  I can't take it.  I've got to get in my car before I fucking melt.  Which is exactly what needs to happen to my dearly departed friends.    Lila, what are you doing here?   Hey.  Dexter.  You know, I've been thinking about you breaking up with me, and, well, I don't think it's in your best interest.  I'm tired and hot, and I have somewhere to be.  I think you should give me another chance.  There's nothing you can do to help me.  It's not even you.  It's me.  I am who I am, and nobody's gonna change that.  Whatever you think you are, you don't have to be that.  That's where you're wrong.  Stop judging yourself.  There are no absolutes.  No one's all good or evil.  You're just gonna have to trust me on this.  Jesus, Dexter! What are you so fucking scared of? You make yourself into a monster so you no longer bear responsibility for what you do.  \"I can't help it.  I'm a monster.  \"Of course I was gonna do that.  I'm a monster. \" It's sad and it's pathetic And it breaks my heart.  You don't think there're monsters in this world? You don't believe people are evil? I'll show you evil.  Well, you want me to open one? Joseph cepeda.  Can I touch? This isn't exactly the reaction I was looking for.  Well, I've never seen anything like this before.  You're not disgusted Appalled, horrified? It's Incredible.  But the person who did this Is a person just like me, like you.  We're all good, Dexter, and we're all evil.  I thought I closed the door to anyone ever seeing me for who I am, but this woman sees me.  She doesn't know it, but she's looking behind the mask, and she's not turning away.  You really impressed me today.  I don't know how you did it, but great job.    I just pretended to be someone else.    Well, it's working.  Keep doing it.  That doctor didn't even see the monster inside you.  Not monster.  It's just, son, you know that you have these dark urges.  Anyway, good job.  And somehow, even under all this pressure, she's able to make me feel okay about who I am and what I am.  So see you soon? I'm here for you.    I've already told you everything.    I know.  I'm sorry.  I came here to apologize.    You were very rude.    I was.  It was shameful of me to disgrace the memory of your husband.  Thank you.  It's been a rough few days, not that you should care about that, but You know, all these bodies I've never seen anything like it.  All murdered Cut into pieces.  The only way I could make sense out of it was to convince myself that they deserved it.  They all needed to be bad people.  But I should never have taken it out on you.  Can you feel it? The breeze? Coming over the water? It's nice.  Yeah.  It's finally cooling down.  Have a nice evening.  Wait.  My husband He kept guns hidden in the walls.  I can show you.  I've never broken into my own place of employment, but desperate times Garbagemen can be so careless.  I say put this Bay Harbor Butcher on the city payroll.  Give him a corner office, a company car and all the ammunition he needs.  At least somebody is doing something to clean up Miami, which is more than I can say for those folks down at city hall.    Hey, Debra.    Hi.  Sorry about last night.  Don't be.  Maybe we can do it again.  How would you feel about a real date? You know, with clothes on? Where we actually talk and get to know each other? Something like that.  Sounds good.  How about Saturday? Deal.  Pick you up at 8:00.  And with us right now, we have psychologist Sandy Ramos to provide insight into the Bay Harbor Butcher evil serial killer or avenging force for good? This is the last time.  Bertrand? Babe, come on.  You don't mean that.  No, I do mean it.  I do.    I can't see you anymore.    Wait.  No, wait, no.  I don't understand, Maria.  This this is done? She's gone.  It's over with.  We can finally be out in the open.  Just you and me, okay? Just like what we wanted.  No, Bertrand, stop.  Go back to esmee.  So, what, this is how it is? You get your job back, and now you're through with me? Look, don't play the victim.  You knew what this was from the beginning.  You are one coldhearted bitch, I'll tell you that.  No, you don't get to tell me anything! I am not the piece of shit fucking another woman behind his fianc\u00e9e's back! You try and judge me, asshole.  You don't know the first thing about me.  Yeah, so, I think I misjudged Lila.  Are you sure? I mean, she's unconventional, but I think she's the best sponsor for me.  Well, if she can help keep you clean.  Who's this? Could it be Robin Hood? No, I'm the butcher man! I made it for him.  I thought it might help with the nightmares.  Bet you didn't know you could fly.  Have I misjudged Lila? I have no idea.  I do know she's helping me look at myself in a different way.    He's good, that one.    I know.  I got lucky.  Quite an actor.  He's hiding something.  I'm sure of it.  For example, we find the genus nitzschia, and we know we're talking about a freshwater marina, and the algae can tell us more about what kind of pollutants are in the water, which would even further narrow Damn it! For the first time, I feel the future might hold something different for me.  It's possible I'm just fooling myself, but I'm willingto take the risk.  Fucking garbagemen.  Broke the refrigeration unit.  It blew hot air all night.  It turned the bodies into pink mush.  How awful! Completely ruined.  You brought your marine biologist and everything.  It made him vomit.  Anyway, good thing the heat didn't affect the rocks.  Lundy had us store them separately.    The rocks?   Yeah.  The algae we found on the rocks.  The Bay Harbor Butcher used them to weigh his bags down.  We assume he picked them up where he docks his boat.  But I thought the marine biologist came to examine the bodies.  No.  No, it's all about the rocks, baby.  Manny took him to his lab.  Should have results in a week or so.  That should help us narrow down what marina they came from.  It's an odd sensation to be experiencing what might be called hope for the first time in my life.  At the same time, I suddenly find myself weighing the benefits of electrocution versus lethal injection.  But here I am.      Previous EpisodeNext Episode"

It's all about the rocks, baby.    The rocks? The algae we found on the rocks.  The Bay Harbor Butcher used them to weigh his bags.  We assume he picked them up where he docks his boat.  October 3, 1973, Laura Moser and three others found chopped up with a chain saw.  A drug dealer didn't appreciate Laura and her friends stealing his cocaine.  Why didn't Harry want me to see the report? You were left there for days, starving, in blood two inches thick.    This is my mother.    Gail.  He's hiding something, I'm sure of it.  Did you kill your wife?   Yeah.    Don't make me do it! Debra, actually.  I'm Gabriel.  You're into the kinky stuff.  No, the last guy I had sex with tried to kill me.    There's my sponsor.    Really? Where? Dexter, meet Dexter.  I'm gonna help the two of you get to know each other.  You're going to tell me all your deepest, darkest secrets. 3   But the person who did this   Is a person just like me, Like you.  We're all good, Dexter, and we're all evil.  This woman sees me.  She doesn't know it, but she's looking behind the mask, and she's not turning away.  Here's your cappuccino and scone, ma'am.  Can I help the next person, please? Most people hate long lines.  Can I have a coffee and a danish? The bank, grocery store, coffee bar.  Not me.  Buddy, you mind? Want a real glimpse of human nature? Stand in the way of someone's mocha latte.  It also reminds me that the good people of Miami and I aren't so different.  They have no more idea of what I am than I do.  All I'm saying is these guys had it coming.  So what, just chop them all up? In my opinion, whoever's doing this deserves a goddamn medal.    That'll be $4. 20, ma'am.    Sorry, my wallet's in here somewhere.  I got it.    Are you sure?   Yeah, I insist.  Thank you so much.  You're a godsend.  Sweet mary, mother of fuck, that's good! You might have broken a commandment somewhere in there.  Burning the late night oil with the task force? Hardly.  Till we get the report back on the algae, it's just one big reach around.  The rocks I used to submerge my victims may eventually sink me, too, but if I'm learning anything in recovery, it's \"one day at a time. \" Bay Harbor Butcher Give me one shot.  I'd put a bullet in the fucker's head.    You really feel that way?   He's killing people, Dex.  Dad taught us the value of human life.  Yeah, but I think we had different homework assignments.  Dispatch.  See you tonight? I think I'm staying at Gabriel's.    I thought you were taking it slow.    We are.    No sex, just cuddling.    My little sister, the cuddler.  I got a scalding hot beverage here.    Don't make me use it.    Love you, too.  I never really got the whole superhero thing.  But lately, it does seem we have a lot in common: tragic beginnings secret identities Part human, part mutant Archenemies.  Great way to start the day, huh? Shouldn't you be moving back into your office, boss? I'd rather be here.    What can you tell me?   Blunt force trauma.  The blood spatter here on the counter suggests that this is where the initial blow occurred.  Impact spatter is consistent with repeated blows to the skull.  The victim tried to flee to the back door but didn't get far.  Who is he? Denny Foster.  Worked here.  Owner said he closed up nights.  Robbery? There's no money missing from the register.  Something this brutal is personal.  Want to meet your prime suspect? He has fins.  Should we call the super friends for help? No, I got it covered.  I found traces of blood here on the base.  I'll bring it back to my lab, confirm it's the murder weapon.  Got a next of kin we can notify?   Denny was, like, a loner   Who's that? The Dark Defender.  Denny had this great idea to put a spin on that vigilante serial killer we got running around.  Definitely has a nicer ring to it than the Bay Harbor Butcher.  I'm conducting an interview here.  Denny was trying to set up the Dark Defender as a graphic novel.  \"Stalker of the night, his blade of vengeance turns wrong into right. \" I need some air.  Thanks a lot.  \"The Dark Defender. \" No, Miami's too hot for all that leather.  The first time I got high, I was 15.  No, that's not right.  I was 14.  No, wait.  I was definitely 15 because it was my freshman year.  I remember now because I was dating Susie Mitchell.  We broke up 'cause I called her by her sister Sharon's name once.  She hated when people did that.  What she didn't know was that I had a thing for Sharon.  Sharon didn't want anything to do with me, so Don't you hurt my baby! Don't you dare! Don't look.  Close your eyes.  Mommy loves you.  Don't you hurt my baby! It's okay, mom.  You're safe.  That's hot.  Where did you drift off to, anyway? I was having this bizarre dream about my mother.  Say no more.  Oedipus complex, explains a lot.  So, what were you doing to your mother in this dream? Saving her life.  She was murdered When I was a boy.  I was there.  I saw it happen.  I've never told anyone that before.  Come on.  Have you thought maybe you weren't saving your mother in this dream? Maybe you were saving yourself.  That's not what happened.  Don't be so sure.  When I got clean, all the seriously fucked up reasons I used in the first place began to surface.  This could be where your addiction started.  I hope whoever did it got the bloody chair.  There were 3 men.  I don't know what happened to them.  If these guys are behind bars, you need to confront them.  If they're dead, hell, go piss on their graves, but you need to do whatever it takes so you can get closure.  How else do you expect to get better? I never expected to get better.  My meth lab's in the sock drawer.    This looks bad, doesn't it?   Yeah.  The cute panties help.  I'm trying to get to know you better By rifling through my stuff? I'm retarded.  And you've been so great.  You know how I told you the last guy I had sex with tried to kill me? Well, that was kind of true.  He was the Ice truck Killer.  Who is he? Not fucking funny.  Come on, Deb.  I never heard of him before.    Stop it.  Don't screw with me.    I've been in El Salvador visiting family for six months.  I just got back.  You sound like every other jackass out there who thinks I'm a trophy fuck.  You had no idea who I was when you hit on me at the gym? When I hit on you at the gym, it was because I thought you were hot.  Good answer.  So, what's hot about me? It's in the corner! Don't hurt it! Dexter, be careful.  Use a broom.  It might have rabies.  Oh, it's right there! Get it! Watch it! Careful.  Alright! He got it! My hero.  Alright, kids.  Show's over.  Come on.  Let's get dressed for school.  So, any armadillos in Michigan? We didn't have any in Florida.  Now it's like an invasion.  \"Armadillos attack!\" You think you're charming, don't you? I'm sure it probably works for you most of the time.  It did for paul.  I know what you are.  Confused? I found these in a drawer.  Tell me, why would Rita print out narcotics anonymous literature if Paul's dead? Because recently I entered the program.  I knew it.    I would never hurt Rita like Paul did.    I'm not gonna give you that chance.  It's just a matter of time before you pull her under just like he did.  Have you discussed any of this with Rita? No, but I will if you don't do the right thing here.  If you truly care about this family like you say you do, you will let my daughter and those sweet children go.  The algae on the rocks was exposed to both zinc and lead.  There're only 3 marinas near Bay Harbor which have restricted water flow that would account for such high levels of these specific pollutants.  Turkey creek, sunset keys, and coral cove.  Anyone familiar with these marinas? Coral Cove is where my dad kept our family boat.  My brother uses the slip now.  I'll bet half the force has boats out there.  It's one of the few marinas left that's affordable on a cop's salary.  Morgan and I will take that one.  Sodoquist and Lee, Turkey Creek is yours.  And, Hill and Ramos, you've got Sunset Keys.  The rest of you, stay here with detective Batista.  When the team reports in, relay the information back to me.  If our killer's boat is out there, let's find it.  Sorry it took so long.  Couldn't find any other crime scene files.  Probably lost in storage somewhere.  That's what I was able to dig up.  Just one file? There were 3 men arrested for those murders.  One's deceased, one's doing life without possibility, and that's the only one that's still an open case.  Santos Jiminez.  Why's it an open case? Jiminez turned state's evidence, went into witness protection.  There's a business address in there for him.  I guess after 34 years, he figures all the people who want him dead are long gone.  He figured wrong.  If you can't find what you need, there's audio tapes referenced with this file.    Tapes?   Yes.  See that notation? There was a criminal informant working a cocaine bust from the inside.    I'll take those too.    OK.  Harry always said, \"never make things personal, \"it clouds your judgement. \" But I've been living in a fog way too long.  Today is Friday, September 28, 1973.  This is detective Harry Morgan.    Dad.    Case file I can't fucking do this anymore! I have to know when the next shipment's coming in, Laura.  Laura Moser my mother.  I can't take this anymore.  Harry, I'm so scared.  Everything's going to be OK.  You just need to calm down.  I took the cocaine as evidence, just like you asked, isn't it enough? If we want Estrada and his men behind bars, we have to catch them in the act at the shipyard.  He's gonna find out, and then he's gonna kill me.  Harry, listen to me.  I think someone may have followed us to the park.  If we were followed, I would have noticed.  I just need you to hold out a little longer.  This will all be over soon.    I need to pick up Brian at school.    I won't let anything happen to you or your boys.  You have my word.  Harry broke his word.  He wasn't called to that crime scene by chance.  It was his case.  Laura Moser was his informant.  Harry knew my mother.  Our suspect is 6'2\", 380 pounds, Hispanic, drives a 1971 Ford pickup.  Circulate his DMV photo.    I've got good news.    Me too.  Turns out our vic, Foster, he had a blog.  He was in some online geek flame war with a guy calling himself \"corndude. \" The D. A.  finally signed off on your review.  There won't be any charges.  This corndude's real name is Benjamin Alvaro.  Anyone in the shoot team talk to you about counseling? Why the fuck would I need counseling? 'Cause you shot a man last week, James.  That's two shootings in less than 6 months.    Come on, it's got to take its toll.    I'm fine, but thanks anyway.  The sushi place next door has a security camera that covers the parking lot.  You know, department's Chaplain's got a good ear.  Can we stay on the goddamn point? The camera caught the license plate of a green and white pickup.  It belongs to Alvaro.  Timecode puts him here after the shop closed.  So send some units to stake out Alvaro's house, and you and I'll take where he works.  It's OK.  I've got Simms and Giles on it.    I got backup.    Come on! It'll be like old times.  Nina, I just got a call from my attorney.  We need to talk about this visitation bullshit.  Can you just try Dexter's office again? Miss, he's not picking up.  Call me when you get this.  Excuse me.  Are you a friend of Dexter's? I'm his decorator.  Love the hat.  Terrence, give her a visitor's badge.  I'll take her up.  Angel Batista.  I'm Dexter's best friend.  Nice to meet you Angel Batista.  My work requires me to be an expert in analyzing patterns.  Now a pattern keeps emerging from my past that's all too familiar.  Harry lying to me.  No wonder he destroyed the file on my mother's death.  It wasn't to protect me.  It was to bury his own guilt.  Look who I found.  Listen, when you're done with him, maybe you can come over to my place.  It's a mess.  Needs a woman's touch.  Yeah? What did you say to Angel? Dexter, these are amazing! Lila, you can't be in here.  Did you find out what happened to the men responsible for your mother's murder? Dead or in prison, except for one.  He cut a deal.  Now he lives in Naples, Florida.  He runs a tavern.  And what are you gonna do about it? Not sure yet.  And you're not the least bit pissed off that this man got away with murder? You sure? Maybe a little.  Then go and tell him.  Healing is all about focusing your rage on the person that's hurt you.  Naples is, what Two hours away? We could go tonight.    Pick me up after work?   Alright.  Can I have one of these? Sure.  What is this stuff? It's corn syrup and dye.  It's my own recipe.  Not bad.  Thank you.  Who doesn't fix something like that?   You alright?   Yeah.  So, I'm thinking we're assuming our killer owns a boat, but what if he How do you stand this Miami heat? Makes my toes swell up.  So Anyway, I was thinking, what if the killer's renting a boat? I can cross reference some names You like cucumber sandwiches, officer Morgan? I don't know.  Anyway, we have some of the dates of when the victims went missing.  It's all about the cream cheese.  So we could cross reference those dates against the rental logs, and maybe the same names will pop up.  Did you hear anything I just said? Not one word.  It's 1:00.  I always stop and eat lunch at 1:00.  You'll learn that about me.  Why don't you sit down? You're welcome to consider it an order if that helps.  The shoes, too.  Shouldn't we be I don't know, investigating the area? You're very fidgety.  Anyone ever tell you that? Yes.  My father.    You applying for the job?   Just an observation.  Sorry.  I'm confused.  Are you criticizing me for wanting to do my job? Yes.  It's 1:00.  Look, the last time I was around boats, a killer was kidnapping me, which might explain why I'm living with my brother and snooping on my new boyfriend.  So forgive me for being a little fidgety, but if it's lunch we're talking, I'm gonna eat a fat pork sandwich, and I'm sure as shit not gonna eat it here.  What? This isn't a commercial marina.  I haven't seen a single rental ID on any of these hulls.  But I can see the upkeep on this place is dismal.  Unsecure perimeter, poor lighting.  Come out here at night, no one'd know what the hell you're doing.  That's why I'm going to order on this marina and the two others.  As soon as I finish my lunch.  I finished my spatter report, put in for a personal day, left word with Rita.  Naples, here I come.  I can't really focus my rage on the man who killed my mother, not with Lila along for the ride.  But I can prepare for the day when I do.  Where are you off to so early? Getting out of town for the night.    Don't wait for me.    In the middle of the week? Thought I'd take the minivan out on the open road.  Who are you? You'll have the place to yourself   if you want to tie up Gabriel again.    Yeah, that one never fucking gets old.  Call me when you're back.  I wanna talk to you about coral cove.  What about coral cove? The algae on the rocks sent us there.  If I were you, I'd really consider moving your boat.  Security out there sucks ass.  That's kind of the point.  This little green algae may as well be kryptonite.  If it's ever traced back to me, I'll be helpless.  Is this a rental? Nope, she's all mine.  So your minivan's a she, is she? Your girlfriend must be jealous.  Is she cool with you doing this? I didn't tell her.  Rita's mom found out I'm in recovery.  She wants me to leave Rita and the kids.  She could be right.  I can't abandon them.  So, what about what you're gonna say to this guy when you get there? I'm sure I'll think of something.  Why don't you practice on me? I'd rather not.  Just try.  Out loud.  I feel like you stole my life.  And? I'm not the person I'm supposed to be.  It's like I'm hollow.  That's good.  Go on.  I hide in plain sight unable to reach out to people Close to me.  I'm afraid I'll hurt them.  Like I've hurt so many others.  This is what he made me become.  Then that's what you should tell him.  What do you remember most about your mother? She had long hair.  Soft like her hands.  That's all.  Yup Just like old times.  You live for this and you know it.  We could always get in the car and pass the time like we used to.  I'm not going down that road again.  Code 1, suspect's vehicle spotted    one on board.    Headed your way.    Copy that.    I'll take lead.    I got it.  We don't want this guy to do anything stupid in a crowd of people.  That's what you out here for, to babysit me? I'm here because I worry about you.  How many fucking ways do I have to tell you that I'm fine? That's what worries me.  You're fine with killing two men? You're fine?   Been more than two.    This isn't the army, james This is my department.  I need to know you are fit for duty.  That's my job! That's all you care about is your job, even if it meant doing pascal's man to get it back.  How did you know about Bertrand? I didn't for sure until just now.  I know you, Maria.  We rode together for 2 years.  When you want something, you get it.  Pascal was in your way.  We're not talking about this.  You all up in everybody else's shit as long as it ain't yours.  There's Alvaro.    Wait til he gets out of the car.    How long you be wiping my ass? Until I see my old partner again.  On my go.    On the ground!   Hands where I can see, Alvaro! Remember, this is about you.    Not about him.    It's alright if we get there   and you can't go through with this.    I know.  'Cause we can come back another time.  I want to meet him tonight.  This isn't art.  This is cottage porn.  That's Rita.  Say no more.  I need to take a shower anyway.  Don't leave without saying goodbye.  It's so good to hear your voice.  I was starting to get worried.    You still on the road?   No, I just got in.  Well, you said you'd call.  Where are you? I decided to look up someone from my past.  That's what suddenly came up? Dexter, what's going on? Well, after this morning, I figured it'd be better if I kept my distance.    What happened this morning?   Let's just say your mom isn't a big fan of men in recovery.  Oh, shit.  Look, this means nothing.  I'm gonna take care of this.  Now, when are you coming back?   Tomorrow morning.    Promise me you'll stop by the house 1st thing.  Sure.  I'm so sorry about this, Dexter.  See you soon.  Why are you not in the shower? I know.  I'm just checking some e mails.  We have to be at the restaurant in half an hour.  Sure you don't want to join me? You stink.  Thought you liked it dirty.  \"Ice princess\"? Fuck.    You son of a bitch!   Deb, what did I do? You lied to me! You're a writer! I'm trying to be, yeah! I saw all of those e mails you sent to those publisher.    The ice princess!   You went through my e mail! All you wanted was to get close to me to sell a book about me and the Ice Truck Killer!   That's crazy.  Those letters   Fuck you! Fuck you! What can I do you for?   Drink?   Beer.  Whatever's on tap.  Una fr\u00eda, coming up.  Way to ditch me.  You were in the shower.  So, are you there? Do you see him? He's staring at me.  You gonna say something? I don't know what I'm gonna do yet.  I should go.  Well, call me when you figure it out.  All right? Three bucks.  You had no right! He's an addict, Rita.  He is no good for you! He's already got you smoking again.  You turned your back on me and your grandchildren.  That was not my fault.  I tried to warn you about Paul, but you ran away with him anyway.  I wasn't running away with Paul.  I was running away from you.  Do you have any idea how much it hurts me to see you make the same mistakes again? I've had my fair share of mistakes.  And guess what    you were right about Paul.  He was a terrible man.  But for the first time, i feel safe and loved.  And that's because of Dexter.  I can't talk to you when you're like this.  I'm going to bed.  This is my life, mother.  If you can't be happy for me, then maybe you shouldn't be here.  If you want to abandon me and the kids again, fine.  That's your choice.  But Dexter is not going anywhere.  Last call was 30 minutes ago.  You hear me? I need you to finish that up.  Sorry.  I'm avoiding going back to my motel room.  I'm visiting from Miami.  You ever been there? I can't say that I have.  How long you lived in Naples? Oh, a few years now.  You like it? All right, co\u00f1o.  Go.  Okay.  This is gonna be awkward.  I need to tell you how I feel.  No, what you need to do is leave because you been eyeballing me all night.  You really shouldn't do that.  I said get out of my bar.    Okay.  Just let me say what I need to say, and I'll go.  You stole my life.  What the fuck? You are really beginning to piss me off.  I'm not the person I'm supposed to be because you took someone from me.  I will beat your fucking head in if you don't walk out that door right now! I tried Lila's way.  The port of Miami! A shipping container! A chain saw! Laura Moser! You remember now? You remember now? You got me confused with someone else! I know exactly who you are! You made me into what I am! Okay! I I killed her.    I had to!   Did you? Did you have to? Did you have to saw her into little pieces? Did you have to leave 2 little boys soaking in a pool of their mother's blood? Estrada would have killed me if I didn't.  You slaughtered her like an animal because she stole his precious cocaine.  No.  We found out she was a snitch for a cop.  She was fucking him.    Which cop?   I didn't know his name.  I followed them to a park.  My mother and Harry? That's what got her killed? I'm not done with you yet.  Isn't this what heroes do    Avenge lost loved ones? What? Everything okay? Dexter, what's wrong? I thought I could resist.  Jesus are you using? No, but I'm about to.  Tell me where you are and I'll get in a taxi and I'll come get you.  I have to do this.  No, you don't! Just tell me where you are.    You'll be too late.    Don't you bloody do this.    You are stronger than that.    I'm not! Yes, you fucking are.  You've come this far.  If you turn back now, you'll go right back to the way you were Hollow, angry, alone.  I will get you through this.  I swear.  Just come back to me.  Okay? Are you all right? It's okay.  I didn't It's okay.  I don't care what you did.  It's okay.  It's okay.  Baby.  It's okay.  What are you still doing here? Making sure our marina surveillance is in place.    You forget something?   I'm working up rental logs on the other two marinas.    You don't give up, do you?   Do you? I'm wide awake anyway.  Dexter's out of town.  I don't really sleep when I'm by myself.  What about the new boyfriend? We sort of broke up.  I broke up with him.  Guess you won't be needing this, then.  What's that? Background check.  You said you were snooping.  Just thought I'd help.  You ran a background check on my boyfriend?   What's it say?   Gabriel's clean.  Well, except for those parking tickets.  Just because he's not a criminal doesn't mean he's not an asshole.  I went through his e mail.  I know, but it was worth it.  I mean He was using me to shop around a book about the ice truck killer.  Do you know what kind of writer Gabriel is? Children's books? \"The Ice Princess\" is a children's book.  How could I be so fucking stupid? When my wife met me, she was convinced I was a spy.  Connie didn't know it, but she was actually right.  You ran a background check on her? No need.  Must be nice to just know like that.  She died two years ago.  Cancer.  I'm sorry.  That's how I lost my mom.  I should go.  Let me ask you something.  That boyfriend of yours, Did he ever give you a reason not to trust him? But I don't think it matters.  I mean, I went insane on him.  He'll never forgive me.  Any broken bones involved? Facial contusions? You'll be fine.  Do you want to know how I got into the program? I'd used for years.  Binge, crash.  Thought I had it under control.  Then I met Marco.  What a shit.  Thought he was my boyfriend, but he turned out to be my dealer.  Bastard had me so strung out by the time he left, nothing mattered.  Nothing was left but rage.  One night I was so fucked up, God.  I went to his house, and I burned it to the ground.  What I didn't know was that Marco was passed out inside.  They blamed the fire on his drugs.  But it was me.  He died because of me.  That night, I went to my first meeting.  Seeing that side of myself was terrifying.  That I could possibly do that to another person.  Did he deserve it? Yes.  Then you didn't do anything wrong.  Hey, you.  I wasn't expecting you this early.  I didn't hit any traffic.  You're just in time for breakfast.  Where's your mom? Oh, I doubt she'll be joining us.  She's been in her room all morning.  My guess is she's packing.  Maybe I should go.  No, you're staying right here because you're a part of this family.  Are you sure? I've put you through so much lately.  I'm here for you, Dexter No matter what.  What's this? The patch.  I have some quitting of my own to do.  Sit.  Is that anything important? Nope.  Morning.  Morning, Dexter.  Hi Gail.  So, Rita assures me that you are committed to getting better.  I am.  Then I wanna be here to help.  In fact, I've decided to stay in Miami.  I e mailed the school board my letter of resignation this morning.  What about your house? I'll put it on the market.  Sweetie, I thought about what you said last night.  I haven't been here for you, and I want to change that.  My sister's looking for a new apartment.  I'm sure we can help you find one, too.  Well, don't be silly.  I'll be living here.  Dexter, be a dear and pass me the cream, please.  Thank you.  Harry taught me to lie and keep my darkest secrets from those around me Which is why I need to make sure there's not a trace of blood left on my boat.  He also taught me not to rush to judgment.  Things aren't always what they appear to be including Harry.  And what about me? Am I the twisted Bay Harbor Butcher Or the valiant Dark Defender? Only time will tell.  Funny thing is I've met someone who doesn't care what I am.  I suppose every hero needs a sidekick Every villain, a partner in crime.  All my relationships have been built on not knowing.  But that may be changing.  Imagine that a life with no more secrets.      Previous EpisodeNext Episode"

Is she OK with you doing this?   I didn't tell her.  I don't care what you did.  I'm no longer sure who made me what I am.  Funny thing is I've met someone who doesn't care.    We need to talk about Coral Cove.    What about coral cove? The algae on the rocks sent us there.  If I were you, I'd consider moving your boat.    Security out there sucks.    When I'm back, I'll hit the marina and make sure there's no blood traces on my boat.  It isn't a commercial marina.  But I can see the upkeep on this place is dismal.  That's why I'm gonna order on this marina and the two others.  There's another shipment coming in tomorrow.  Cocaine.  How much? Can you get your hands on some? That wasn't part of our agreement.  We need hard evidence.  Otherwise, it's just your word against Estrada's.  I'll protect you.  I promise.  You better.  Do you meet me later? Laura, the tape's still rolling.  Very convincing.  What was that? Laura, the tape's still rolling.  Damn it.  My mother Confidential informant and mumbler.  Whatever sweet nothings she had to whisper I probably don't want to hear.  It seems that my foster father and my biological mother were having an affair.  It's bad enough I can't shake the visual.  But the questions Did he blame himself for her death? Is that why he took me in? Did he love her, or was he just using her? Was he using me? I always thought Harry's code was on The Spot creative problem Solving, But maybe he planned for me to settle the score all along.  It's times like this I wish I really were a drug addict.  I had emotional problems as a kid because of what happened to my mom.  Harry said he was trying to help me, mut we only talked about his rules.  I spent so much time trying to live up to his expectations because I thought he had my best interests in mind.  If you come over this late, the least you could do is bring me a coffee.    Sorry.    Cappuccino Make a note of it.  Truth is, Dex, It doesn't really matter why Harry did what he did.  The result's the same.  You have an addiction.  Do you think Harry made me what I am? Plenty of people go through trauma without turning to addiction.  Whatever Harry taught you led you down the wrong path.  But I've built everything in my life on what Harry said I was supposed to be.  My job, my girlfriend It's all what Harry told me I needed.  What do you think you need? I have no idea.  Whatever's inside you is splattered all over that paper I took from your lab.  Looks messy.  It probably is.  Look, Dexter.  Everyone has a moment when they realize their value system is different from their parents'.  Mine was in college, but maybe you're a late bloomer.    Lucky me.    Damn right, lucky you.  You get to have a fresh start.  Whatever you thought or did doesn't matter.  Now you get to figure out who you are.  I went to Lila for answers, but now all I have is more questions.  Who am I? What do I need? What do I want? Coffee.  I really want a cup of coffee.    What up, half day?   Is there coffee left? You're late.  I fell asleep before you got home last night.  Were you at Rita's? You're welcome, ass.    Your brother looks like shit.    Tell me about it.  I may be out of line with this, but did he fall off the wagon? What wagon? The only wagon he's ever had is a radio flyer.  Your brother's a junkie.  Isn't he? Are you high? He's never even smoked a cigarette.  I'm glad you got some new material, though, 'cause \"freak\" and \"psycho\" were getting kind of tired.  Agent Lundy? So, I hear a rumor you're tracking all our Internet activity.  Is it true? 'Cause I can explain all that she male stuff.  I need my team outside in five minutes.  That sounds important.  Got a major break in the investigation.  Patrol found a guy saying he escaped the Bay Harbor Butcher.  He claimed he was captured two hours ago.  That's a neat trick, considering I was asleep.  At least trying to sleep.  This could be good news for me.    Morgan?   Yes? The other Morgan.  I'd like you to join us, if you can spare him.  That's fine with me.    Is there blood?   Not that I'm aware of.  But what about Masuka? Yeah, I'm the lead forensics investigator.  Masuka's lab work is more pressing.  I need him to hold down the fort here.  He totally saw the she male stuff.  So, what do you say? I'll buy you lunch after.  Pork sandwich, right?   Yes.  Sure.    Good.  I figured it was time to get a fresh perspective on the case.  Rumor has it you have a knack for attracting serial killers.  I hear the same about you.  Dexter also enjoys long walks on the beach and foreign films.  Then we got a lot to talk about.  He knocked me out.  Then when I woke up, I was tied up in that train car over there.    You said he used rope?   Dumb fuck.  I stretched it out enough so I can get my legs free and I got out of there.  Ran across the road, almost got hit by that guy in the car.  So, that's the alleged victim of the Bay Harbor Butcher.  But I've never seen him before in my life.  O'Connor, Singer, make sure you take pictures of those footprints.    Hey, Dex.    Hey.  So, the victim says the Butcher held him in this train car.  Lundy wants you to search for trace evidence.    Your spidey sense tingling yet?   We'll see when I get inside.  Take your time.  We've never been this close to this pendejo.  Closer than you think, amigo.  He may have borrowed my pseudonym, but this guy doesn't know the first thing about my techniques.  Amateur.  Why do you think it was the Butcher? He told me the Bay Harbor Butcher's gonna clean up Miami.  He said, \"You're gonna get what you deserve. \" And what do you deserve, Mr.  Henry? Well, look.  The Butcher kills criminals, right? I just got out of jail, you know.  Six years for aggravated assault and home invasion, so He kills murderers.  You didn't kill anyone, did you? Alright, I gave this old guy a heart attack.  It's not like I was doing it on purpose, alright? I used to hit retirement homes, communities.  Snowbirds are easy targets.  And I don't do that anymore.  I did my time.  Your mother must be so proud.  I wanna check out the train car with your brother.  Why don't you keep an eye on our friend here while we confirm his story? Sure.  Killing tools left behind.  I'd never be this careless.  Whoever did this would never pass Harry's muster.  Then again, neither would Harry.  He lied about my past, he cheated on my foster mother with my biological mother.  Maybe Lila's right.  It's time for a new set of standards.  If you were the Bay Harbor Butcher, would you use a place like this? Actually, yes.  Location wise, it's not a bad choice.  It's quiet, remote.  Could use an upgrade in the lighting department, but You think this is our guy? Not exactly.  From what I understand, the conditions in this space don't support his M. O.  It's filthy, for one thing.  Butcher's clean orderly.  And some people would say compulsive.  Really? You think he's compulsive? That doesn't fit either.  A hatchet is sloppy.  The butcher uses precise surgical instruments.  He's not that predictable.  Is he? Mixes it up.  Different tools every time.  And never rope.  He uses duct tape and plastic wrap.    Plastic wrap, how can you tell?   Depression patterns in the skin.  Maybe the butcher's having an identity crisis.    It's entirely possible.    But not likely.  My guess is we're looking for a vigilante inspired by the butcher's principles.  Bet he never thought he'd be a role model.  I bet you're right.  So, any new leads on the real guy? Not yet.  We hope the cameras'll turn something up.    Cameras?   In the marinas.  Put them in a couple of days ago to monitor for suspicious activities.  Good news for all those cops who keep boats at Coral Cove.  You've got one, too, right? We've been needing a security upgrade for a long time now.  Has Lundy seen me on the tape? Is that why he invited me along today? To mess with me? Sorry if I was short with you this morning.  I'm lost without my morning coffee.    Whatever.  How was your playdate with Lundy? Did you bond? You didn't tell me they put up security cameras at the marinas.  It's not like they're doing us any good.  The station's computers need an update so we can synch up with Lundy's equipment.    The cameras aren't recording?   They are, but nobody saw the footage.  Lundy said it should be fixed by tonight.  That's a relief.  Your mom told me about your cultural presentation at school.  Did your teacher give you a country yet? Saudi Arabia.  No.  That's israel.  I won't tell the Saudis you said that.  Looks like Cody's enjoying himself.  Dexter's very patient with him.  Dexter's a saint.  Where's Astor? Uh, she's by the water.  I want to say goodbye.  I gotta go.  I was supposed to meet Lila Who's Lila? His sponsor.  Really? A woman? Dexter's sponsor is a woman.  Is that a problem? Is she attractive?   Mom   I'm just curious.  Is she? I have an idea.  Why don't you and Lila have dinner with us? That's very kind of you, Gail, but I think it'd be really nice if we got to know the woman you spend so much time with.    Mom, they're doing step work.    But they have to eat, right? Here.  Let me help.  Thank you.  So lovely of you to have me over.  Now I can put names to faces.  Dexter talks about you all the time.  Good things, I hope.  Dexter never says a bad word about anyone.  Tell me, Lila.  What exactly are you recovering from? I'm a meth addict, sober five years.  I don't know much about meth.    Rita's ex Husband shot heroin.    Like Dexter.  Guess we know your type, don't we? Just can't seem to help myself.  You have nothing to worry about with Dexter, I mean.  I'm sitting right here.    I didn't mean to imply   No.  I completely understand.  Rita's your little baby.  You have every right to be concerned.  But if I can reassure you, Dexter's doing incredibly well.  Well, I'm happy to hear that.  And I'm sure it's got everything to do with the two of you.  He tells me you're very supportive.  Dexter's lucky to have you.  Well that's very sweet of you to say.  So, tell us more about yourself.  Dexter tells me you're an artist.  Yeah, she does amazing things with a blowtorch.  What's it called? Talent.  But I'm not the only artist at the table.    Since when?   It's not really art.  She's talking about a blood spatter pattern she took from work.  What kind of career choice is blood spatter, exactly? He helps catch criminals, mother.  And it makes perfect sense, what with Dexter's mother and everything.  You know she's dead.  Forgot the bread.  Dinner was fantastic, Rita.  And this dessert I never thought I'd say this, but I kind of like her.  Yeah, me too.  She's really helping me.  I wish she didn't have to help you tonight.  Why? What are you thinking?   My mom could watch the kids.    I have to swing by the office tonight.  I need to take care of something really important.  I mean, can't it wait till morning? I promise we'll go straight to bed.  You're very convincing, but it needs to get done tonight.  Just give me an hour, okay? Meet you back at my place? I still think it's funny you write children's books.  Yeah, a big, tough guy like me should be do something manly, like wrangling cattle.  I don't even know any kids' books.  My dad told me cop stories before bed.  It was really the only alone time I ever got with him.  You okay? Yeah.  Sorry, just an annoying day at work.  You know the FBI guy I was talking about? I was really starting to feel like I was his go to girl, But he realized Dexter is the superior Morgan.  I should be used to it, you know? It was like that with my dad, work.  I guess I hoped Lundy would be different.    Why?   I don't know.  I respect him.  He's great at his job, supersmart, And, like, funny, but in this really dry way where he doesn't even know it.  You love him.  What? You totally have a crush on Grundy.    Lundy.    Now you're getting touchy about it.  I don't have a crush on him.  He's like my dad.  Except I spent my life trying to get my dad to notice me, and he actually pays attention to what I say.  And grundy loves you.  Oh, fuck off.  Lundy's good   Double Locked and a bit beyond my expertise.  I could try to crack it open, but in my own station too risky.  I can do this more often now that my mom's in town.  I feel like we're being bad.  Bad Bad is good.  Let the machine get it.  Hey, Dex, just calling to check in.  Thought we could do the debriefing on dinner.  I thought it went well, don't you? I'd say so.  Rita's sweet, very Martha Stewart.  I love Martha Stewart.  God, her mum, she's got quite the rod up her ass, doesn't she? By the way, I am such a twat.  I can't believe I almost slipped up about your mum.  At least, I didn't spill the beans about our road trip.  Don't you dare! Can you imagine Rita's face if I told her you and I spent the night together in a hotel? Anyway You and Lila stayed in a hotel together?   We had adjoining rooms.    Adjoining rooms? Right.  God, I am such an idiot.  I can't believe I defended you while you were sleeping with another woman.  Wait.  I thought you were different than Paul, but you're the same.  Actually, you're worse.  You made me trust you.    Please, just let me explain.    I've had it! I have been patient and understanding, but there's only so much I can take.  You're a liar and a cheat, and I am through.  It's over, Dexter! Tracy Jenkins was given the liver of a 9 year old Hi, honey.  I thought you were spending the night at Dexter's.  We had a fight.    I think we broke up.    What? Mama's here.  Yesterday I was so hopeful.  A new me, a new life.  But a life without Rita seems strange.  What in the name of fuck are you doing up so early? I got to get to the station.  Are you okay? You seem weird.  Weirder than usual.  Rita broke up with me last night.  Seriously? What happened? It's a long story.  I've got time.  Yeah but I don't.  Cliff Notes.  She thinks I did something bad, but I didn't.  Did you tell her that? I tried, but she dumped me before I had a chance to explain.  She said, \"It's over,\" and left.    Did you go after her?   Was I supposed to? You're such a guy.  When I get pissed, I say stuff I don't mean all the time.  \"I hate you,\" \"I faked it,\"   \"You're hung like a grape. \"   You lost me.  When Rita said, \"it's over,\" I'm sure she didn't actually mean it.  Stop being a douche bag and go fight for her.  She's fucking perfect.  I know.  Sure, I'll be right there.  Yeah.  I'll tell him.  Who's that, Gabriel? No, Lundy.  He's holding a meeting at the station about the bay harbor case.  He specifically requested that you be there.  I missed my window.  He's already seen the footage.    Me? Why?   Because you're his new butt buddy.  You gonna be okay? Check back with me later.  The show has already started, but have they seen the feature presentation? Bane of the Bay Harbor Butcher, starring Dexter Morgan as himself? It's all synched up? Yep, you can watch streaming video of the marina right now if you want to.  Yeah.  Maybe you'll get to see some pontoon poon.  Did you need something? That's not my marina yet.  I'll be making my on screen debut soon enough.  I've got to find a way to get to those video files.  The media frenzy about the Butcher has come back to bite us.  Big surprise.  Now we've got a wannabe vigilante out there Who liked the Butcher's style and thought, \"Hey, I should try this at home. \" He attacked this man   John Henry, Ex convict, preyed on the elderly.  It gets better.  I have already received reports of ads on Craig's list and coffee shop bulletin boards requesting the services of the Butcher.  People think they've found their own personal Batman.  This is not good news.  If this kind of thing catches on, We're looking at an epidemic.    Kind of like herpes.    Fuck, Masuka, I'm trying to listen.  One in four, Morgan.  One in four.  Vigilante justice is domestic terrorism.  And terrorism prevention is the FBI's top priority.  I've done my best to be diplomatic, but if we lose one life to a vigilante, I will pull this case from Miami Metro and hand it over in full to the FBI.  It's a promise.  That's a disaster.  It'd be raining feds in Miami.  So, if we want to keep the investigation here, we need to nip this in the bud, make an example of our would be vigilante.  The last thing we need is a bunch of weekend warriors I think I found a suspect.  Could you? Ken Olson.  Olson's mother was hurt badly in a home invasion robbery.  Guess who hurt her.  Please, tell me John Henry, our train Car victim.  I think Olson attacked him for revenge.    Any evidence?   Only circumstantial.    Can you get him here for questioning?   Can't find him.  OK.  Leak this to some of your media contacts.  Let's beat this guy out of the bushes.  Nice work, detective.  Let's get moving.  I need hard evidence on this Olson character, and fast.  And if you can find the guy, even better.  The full force of the FBI   That's the last thing I need.  I've got to make sure Lundy gets his man after I figure out a way to erase the marina files and make up with my girlfriend.  Then maybe I'll tackle world hunger 'cause things can't really get worse.  Another shipment's coming in tomorrow.  Cocaine.  How much? 300 bricks, give or take.  Turn it off.  That wasn't part of our agreement, Harry.  I said turn it off.  I heard what you said.  I just don't take orders from you.  Is there a reason you're in my lab, sergeant Doakes? Is there a reason you're listening to tapes as old as you are? I had a little talk with your sister.  Turns out she didn't know you were in program.    Anonymous, sergeant.    How long did you say you been clean? Actually, I didn't because it's none of your goddamn business.  So, if I were to take a hair from your desk and run it for drugs, it would come back positive, right? Because why would someone pretend to be an addict if he's not unless he's got something a hell of a lot worse to hide? Back the fuck off.  You want to hit me? Go for it.  I've been waiting for a chance to take your ass out.  I know how you feel, sergeant.  I want to file a formal complaint against Doakes.  Jesus, Dexter, the two of you He crossed the line, lieutenant! He broke into my lab.  He went through my personal things.  He threatened me.  He's probably gonna start tailing me again.    Sergeant Doakes tailed you?   For weeks, maybe longer.  OK, you have every right to file a complaint, but before you do that, I'd like the chance to talk to James myself.  He's really not much of a talker.  I'm asking you, as a personal favor to me, to hold off.  Can you do that? Yeah.  Okay, in the meantime, I strongly encourage you to take a break for a couple of hours.  Just go somewhere.  Cool off.  No.    Excuse me?   I need to be here, lieutenant.  This is really not a good time for me to leave.  It isn't a suggestion, Dexter.  It's an order.  Clear the station.  Clear your head.  I don't want to see you here until after lunch.  Understood? Blimey, look at you.  You wanna tell me what's going on? What's going on? Being the new me sucks.  I'm about to be found out at work for what I am.  For what I really am.  And I can't do anything to stop it because I got kicked out of the office to cool off.  It seems to be going well for you.  Add to that the fact that Rita heard your message and dumped me last night.  I tried to explain to her nothing happened, but she wouldn't listen to me.    Nobody fucking listens to me!   Listen, you need to calm down.  Last time, you came back covered in blood.  So? You said I was supposed to feel my feelings.  Now I tell you to get them under control.    You don't understand.    Why don't you make me? Which step was that? The naughty one.  What are you thinking? Absolutely nothing.  I guess we found a way to quiet the voices in your head.  I guess so.  How do you feel? Much better actually.  I guess I must be a good sponsor after all.  Definitely.  And where are you off to? I still have that thing at work to deal with.  Well, come back tomorrow.  I promise you some serious recovery.  Hello? Dexter, hey.    You at work?   I will be soon.  I was just taking a break.  What's going on? I'd really like to get together and talk.  I don't like how our last conversation ended.  Me neither.  You said you wanted to explain, and I owe it to you to hear you out.  I owe it to us.  Okay.  So, can you come over after work? Sure.  Great.  Apparently my new life involves a love triangle.  I'm that guy.  The voices are back.  Excellent.  You were tailing Dexter? What the hell were you thinking? If you wanted to have lunch, you could have asked.  If Dexter files a complaint, you will be kicked off the force, end of story.  There's a reason he hasn't reported me until now.  He's hiding something.  I can feel it.  Is this another one of your conspiracy theories? It's instinct and a hell of a lot of experience.  I've spent years looking the enemy in the face, and I'm telling you Morgan is dangerous.  Your instincts haven't been that great these days, James.  Two shootings in the last six months, Stalking a police employee Listen to me.  Morgan lied about the Ice Truck Killer.  That crack pipe knew more than he told us.  He was trying to protect his sister.  You of all people should understand.  I followed him to an N. A.  meeting.  That asshole lied about that too.    You're obsessed.    I'm not.  You are, and I need you to see it as your boss and as your friend.  We've been through this before.  Last time it cost you our relationship.  This time it's gonna get you kicked off the force or worse.  I'll take my chances.  Let it go.  I mean it.  Leave Dexter alone.  The Batista suspect come in yet, the wannabe vigilante? Olson just came in.  Saw himself on the 3:00 news and showed up with his lawyer.  I hope we nail his ass to the wall.  I love it when you talk dirty.    Morgan?   Right here.  The other Morgan.  I didn't know you were a smoker.  Have you seen Dexter Morgan? He's on a break.  Why? Detective Batista's got a suspect in interview room 1.  We think he's the would be vigilante who attacked our train car victim.  I need him to take some scrapings for evidence.  You want to use Dexter again? Isn't Masuka on your task force? Yes, he is.  So, Mr.  Olson, the man who assaulted your mom was attacked yesterday.    Did you know that?   Nope.  Can't say I'm upset, though.  Son of a bitch almost killed my mom.  My client's emotional, detective.    I'm sure he's not trying to say   Any idea who might have done it? I don't know.  Maybe it was the Butcher.  I think a guy like that should be running the police force, not hiding from it.    Is this a lion or a hippo?   I think it's a lion.  Tastes like a hippo.    Animal cracker?   No, thank you.  What do you do for a living, Mr.  Olson? I just lost my job.  That's too bad.  I see that you have a minor assault record and no alibi for yesterday morning.  I'm sure my client didn't realize he needed one.  You have a girlfriend, Mr.  Olson? She just broke up with me.  Why, you interested? Just curious.  Now, this is a lion.  Alright, let me keep this all straight.  No job, no relationship.  You got guns and a minor assault record.    And I voted for Bush both times.    Sorry, were you getting at something? What he's getting at, Mr.  Novik, is your client fits the 4 point profile of someone who'd commit a vigilante offense.  You're a ticking time bomb.  You ask me, you just needed a reason to take the law into your own hands.  And the butcher was the perfect excuse.    You don't know me.    We know you attacked John Henry.  You need proof to make those kinds of accusations, detective.  You heard the man, detective.  We've got work to do.  Make yourself comfortable, Mr.  Olson.  We're just getting started with you.  That's my marina.  And in less than 30 minutes, I'll be on that screen.  I need to take care of this, and fast.  I'm out of time.  I need an idea, a sign, anything.  What would the old Dexter do? Definitely not that.  No security cameras.  Apparently the new Dexter's stuck in high school.  Maybe I am a late bloomer.  A fire drill? Are you kidding? We have work to do.  It's probably one of those kids in the bullpen.  It's something I would have done.  Well, at least it stopped raining.  All clear.  Everybody out.  All clear! Everybody out! Respect the vest.  Don't make me take out my hose.  Like it never happened.  If only the rest of life were so easy to figure out.  Where you headed? I figured you'd be 1st to ogle the firemen.  I have to arrange protective custody for that fucking train car victim.    Why?   'Cause we have nothing on Olson, not even enough to get a warrant to search his place.  Is that Olson's file? If we don't get something soon, Lundy'll have to let him go, meaning Olson will kill again, meaning we lose the Butcher case to the FBI,   meaning we're fucked.    Some more than others.  No shit.  Till Lundy showed up, I felt like the dipshit who slept with the ice Truck killer.  If he pulls the plug, I go back to being the resident retard.  Chin up little sister, these things have a way of working themselves out.  I just have to find a piece of evidence to make sure Lundy catches Olson fair and square.  Looks like I have a fan club, membership of one.  Why you so interested in the Butcher? Who the fuck are you? Holy shit, you're him, aren't you? Stop.  Don't kill me.  Don't kill me.  I'm like you.  I take out criminals.  You mean you try pitifully.  No, that was just the last one.  He got away.  I should have never made it personal.    You've killed others?   That's I'm telling you.  First was a drug dealer   I ran him down with my car.  It felt It felt fucking great, Even better than the free stash I got off him.  And then, this guy at work found out I was fucking his wife.  He started to beat on her, so I pushed him down a stairwell.  The cops thought it was an accident, but it was me.  See, you can't kill me.  I wasn't going to until now.  This is what the kill room should look like.  The inside of a big plastic bag.  Of course, I spent hours working in this train car yesterday, so I'm not too worried about trace evidence.  To your credit, your location was well chosen.  It just needed a little cleaning, a few lights, proper tools, of course.    I did it because of you.    No.  You attacked those people because you wanted to.    You inspired me   I didn't.    with your principles.    They're not mine.    Of course they are!   Don't tell me who I am.  All my life, I've done what someone else said I should do, been who he said I should be.  I followed his rules, I stuck to his plan.  I never stopped to think about what I wanted and what I needed.  And now I don't know who I'm supposed to be.  I'll tell you one thing, though.  I'm not the Bay Harbor Butcher.  I'm certainly not anybody's role model.  What are you talking about then? Who are you? I'll let you know when I figure that out.  Though, I got to tell you, I am well on my way, because as sure as I'm standing here, I don't need to kill you.  That's a relief.  I mean that need that comes from within that always drives me to this table I don't feel it.  I'm in recovery.    I knew you weren't gonna kill me.    No, I will kill you.  I have to.  I just don't need to.  It's very empowering.  Anyone in there, make yourself known! Arm.  Leg.  Head.  It's Olson, gift wrapped.  It would seem the Butcher is watching us,   tracking the investigation.    That wouldn't be too hard to do.  But why'd he leave the victim's body for us? It's a 1st.  Probably didn't take too kindly to the idea of Olson imitating him.  It's a good way to discourage others, don't you think? I hate to say it, but he probably did us a favor.  Take the law into your own hands, the Bay Harbor boogeyman'll get you.  It's the 1st time we've set foot in a place where the Bay Harbor Butcher's actually been.  Let's get busy.    Anybody seen Lundy?   Over there on the phone.  He's talking to D. C. , I think.  Shit.  Is he gonna pull the case from us? Sure, have Robinson call me.  He's got my cell.  I came here for privacy, officer Morgan.    Sorry.    Too much background noise over there.  Hearing's the first thing to go.    Or is it memory? I always forget.    You gonna pull the case from us?   You said if anybody died   At the hands of a vigilante.  This was our killer.  I'm afraid you're still stuck with me.  Will your brother be here tomorrow? Yeah, I think so.  I'll tell him you want him within shouting distance.  What just happened? No, it's cool.  He's always been the family superstar.  Who? Dexter, your new go to guy.  This isn't about Dexter.  It's about Masuka.  I can't stand him.  If I hear one more titty joke, I could punch him in the face.  Really? Any north unit, request has been made for 42 escort from Orange belt to J. M. S.  Hey.  Come on in.  Sit down.  I was angry before when you tried to explain.  This time I'll listen.  I'm sorry I didn't tell you about the road trip.  Lila came with me to Naples as my sponsor.  That's all.  Why would you need her in Naples? You remember when I went out of town? I went to find the man who killed my mother.  What are you talking about? A lot of stuff has been coming up for me in recovery, things I never thought I'd deal with.  I watched my mother die   when I was 3.    God.  I'm so sorry.  She was murdered in front of me.  I saw it happen.  I think that has a lot to do with why I'm why I do the things I do.  Of course.  Of course, it makes sense.  I found the man who killed her in Naples.  I thought maybe if I talked to him, I could find some kind of closure.  That's why Lila came with me.  For support.    What?   This was a huge moment in your life, Dexter and you chose to include Lila but not me.    She's my sponsor.    And I'm your girlfriend.  I was afraid you wouldn't understand.  So let me try to understand now.  You and Lila went away together as sponsor and sponsee.  And you really did have adjoining rooms.  So you didn't have sex that night? Not that night.  Leave.  Rita No, please! Leave now.  There was a time I would have done anything to protect Rita.  I would have even lied.  But today I told the truth even though I knew she'd get hurt.  Maybe I am leaving the old me behind.      Previous EpisodeNext Episode"

Your brother's a junkie Are you high? He's never smoked a cigarette.  Cody's enjoying himself.    Dexter's very patient with 'em.    Dexter's a saint.  I hope you could dig up an old file for me.  Got a date? It's the crime scene where Harry found me.    How much?   300 bricks, give or take.  I've been waiting for a chance to take you.  I know how you feel.  He crossed the line.  He broke into my lab.    He's probably gonna tail me again.    Doakes tailed you? I followed him to an N. A.  meeting.  That asshole lied about that too.    You're obsessed.    I'm not.  Open your eyes! Dinner was fantastic, Rita.  I kind of like her.  Just calling to check in.  Imagine her face if I told her you and I spent the night together in a hotel.  It's over, Dexter.  I hope with Lundy it'll be different.    Why?   I respect him.    You love him.    No.  He's like my dad.  You wanna tell me what's going on? You said I'm supposed to feel my feelings! Now I'm telling you to get them under control! Which step was that? Use the entire canvas.  Start from the top.  Work your way down.  Light, feathery strokes.  Perfect! Stunning.  Try longer strokes now.  Perfect.  You really know what you want, don't you? I hope you don't mind.  Some men do.  I've always found instruction manuals Quite useful.  Your turn.  What do you want? I think that was it.  Come on You must have some dark fantasies unfulfilled urges.  I'm pretty good at acting on those.  Really? Then fuck me like that.  Your light's burned out.  It's the wiring.  I've been asking my landlord to fix it for weeks.  Now I can see better.  That's where my landlord lives.  Now he'll have to fix it.  See you later.  Got to admire Lila for taking things into her own hands.  That includes me.  Mom.  Come on, let's go! No more moping.  I'm not moping.  I'm sleeping.  Oversleeping, 3rd time this week.  The only way you gonna get over Dexter is if you take charge of your day.  Come on.  You're not in high school anymore.  Go scrub your face, and I'll heat up some oatmeal.  Didn't hear you come in last night.  Well, it was late.  I was quiet.  Yeah, you're good at quiet.  Guess you kind of have to be with me crashing here and Rita's mom over there.  You and Rita fuck quiet, too? And she's off, right out of the gate.  Because me, I wake the goddamn dead.    It's a problem.    I know, only too well.  Scary, right? Sometimes I disturb myself.  So what kind of noises does Rita make? Could we not talk about sex Or Rita? Why? 'Cause we broke up.  For real.  It's over.  You break up, you get back together.  That's just what goes on.  I mean, you and Rita are forever.  Say you're sorry and send some flowers.  You're not hearing me.  When all this blows over, I'll spend a few days at Gabriel's, and You can screw Rita as loud as you want.    Big news, Dex.    Feel like I got caught in a wave.  The Miami Tribune received a 32 page manifesto in the mail.  It's looking good for the Bay Harbor Butcher.    I've heard that one before.    Look, this may be legit.  The manifesto includes the names of 3 victims we never released.  That is big news.  I'm heading over to the Tribune now for special agent Lundy.  He put me in charge of the team.    Go, Angel.    Yeah, I'm psyched.  Yeah, me too.  I'm about to be published.  I sent that manifesto to the Tribune.  Guess I've been taking some cues from Lila lately, and not just in bed.  I'm tired of reacting to the moves of agent Lundy and his super posse.  Time to control their actions for a change.  Betsy Court, 16.  Blunt force beating.  Looks like she was sunning herself and never saw it coming.  Who called in the body? Craig Wilson, the stepfather.  He's right over there.  Wilson told the reporting officer that he came home for lunch and found her that way.  You and Dexter resolve your issues? As far as I'm concerned.  Why? The bitch come crying to you again? There's blood work to be done, and if you can't control yourself, I need to call in another detective.  I won't say anything to hurt the girl's feelings.    Goddamn it, I'm not joking.    Do I look like I'm laughing?   I wish you would. You used to.    Bullshit.  I never laughed.  Yeah, you're probably right.  I'm not gonna try to scare you anymore.  Reality is you're out of free passes.  I already stopped Dexter from filing a complaint against you once.    I never asked you to do that.    I did it, out of my own concern over your obsessive behavior.  I'm on the line, so if you bully Dexter in any way, if you even look at him wrong, I won't be responsible for the fallout.    You got it?   I got it.    You're backing the fucking freaktard.    James.  Where you been, Dexter? You don't bring me doughnuts.  You don't sing me love songs.  How are you, Camilla? I've been better.  Well, that doesn't sound good.  Sergeant Doakes dropped by my file room yesterday.  He requested the case files for the 1973 shipping yard murders.  I gave him the same line I gave you when you came sniffing around, said all that old stuff was boxed up in the basement of city hall.  That made him real angry.  He scared me, Dexter.  That's not right.  He shouldn't do that.  I always assumed your father asked me to destroy those files to protect you.  Now I'm not sure what's going on.    Camilla   Now, I don't want to know.  I just don't want to get fired.  I'm retiring next year.  Did I tell you? I've been looking forward to staying home with Gene.  You won't lose your retirement.  I won't let that happen.  I can stall Sergeant Doakes for a few days, but eventually, he'll figure out the file's missing, just like you did.  And he'll track it back to me, just like you did.  I'll take care of this.  You have my word.  So much for threatening Doakes.  He won't back off till he exposes the twisted branches of my family tree, from my father's indiscretions to my murderous brother to the root of all evil me.    Why aren't you at the Tribune?   What for? Our guy's not gonna leave dna evidence on a document.  But the thrill of the hunt.  I've had that particular thrill.  I'll leave it to younger men.  Besides, it's easier for me to do my part from here.  Yeah? What part is that? Operating on favors, political leanings, posturing.  I've been trying to find the right music.  Right.  So, I'm off duty today, but here are those marina reports.  And after my workout, I'll swing by and pick up a copy of the manifesto.  Look at that board.  These kills are precise, but there's also a fluidity, even some improvisation.  If I could just find the music Want to borrow my Ipod? Got any Chopin? No.  Fresh out of Chopin.  Shit.  Chopin's perfect.  Did you just swear? What can I say? You're rubbing off on me, Morgan.  But Chopin is perfect.  So this is how you do what you do.  The truth speaks to me from a peaceful place.  I got to set the stage to hear it.  You know what I mean? I thrive on chaos.  But this is good, too.  I didn't kill her.  I was just trying to stop the blood.  No forceful impact spatter, he's telling the truth, I can tell.  Palms up, please.  When I found Betsy, she was still breathing.  I wanted to help her.  You believe me, right? I'm just the lab guy, Mr.  Wilson.  Sorry.  Arms down at your sides, please.  Blood misting.  I need to collect his shirt for evidence.  The girl's mother was at work but she isn't really defending her husband.  Wilson and his stepdaughter fought all the time.  The neighbors heard him yelling at her this morning, then he comes home for lunch, motive and opportunity.    What'd the blood say?   The one on his hands could have come from trying to help her, like he claims.  But I did detect blood mist on his shirt.  A blood mist? The kind that comes from beating on a teenage girl? No.  Yes.  You're absolutely sure? It's too fine for a bludgeoning.  The mist is from a bludgeoning.  Medium velocity impact spatters, no doubt about it.  Okay, Morgan.  Make sure you get me your blood report as soon as possible.  This is my chance to make Doakes go away without spilling a single drop of his blood.  Of course, I have to sell an innocent man down the river.  Sorry, Mr.  Wilson, but I won't let you float too far.  I was just thinking about you.  I like the sound of that.  Yeah, I had to do a little creative problem solving at someone else's expense.  Bravo.  Yeah, I figured you'd like that.  What's up? Well, you know that art installation I've been working on? The cannibals.  They're not cannibals.  How barbaric! Their eating is symbolic of the way we consume others to feed our needs.    That's what I meant.    Well it sold.  I didn't even create it to sell, but one of my buyers fell in love with it, and I named an outrageous price, and she paid me a deposit on the spot.  So You in the mood to celebrate? Definitely.  I'm afraid we can't seat you tonigh twithout a reservation.  As you can see, we are completely at capacity.  No, I'm sorry.  You have to help us.  I made this reservation 2 months ago.  This is our 10 year anniversary.  This is the place where Dexter proposed to me, on the patio, in front of the fountain.  He told me to make a wish, and when I looked down, there was my diamond ring, sparkling under the water.  That is so romantic.  In case you're wondering, there's nothing sparkling under that water tonight.  I'm sure you'll dazzle me somehow.  You're a creative problem solver now, right? A changed man, or at least \"changing. \" I suppose.  There's no supposing about it, Dexter.  You've taken control of your addiction in a way that few people do.  It's been about a week since we've even discussed your recovery.  I think you're right.    And you haven't felt the need to use?   Incredibly, no.  I feel You know, like I'm finally in control of things again.  We call that warm fuzzy feeling the pink cloud.  It's when an addict experiences acceptance for the first time.  You're saying it won't last? I'm saying that you have to work it, that's all.  But I know that you will, because I believe that we've found a true substitute for your addiction.  What's that? Life.  You're making us all look bad.  I'm the manager of il Bistro Vino.  Happy anniversary.  On the house.  Thank you.  Did you hear that, darling? I heard it, darling.  Enjoy your evening.  Thank you.  Happy anniversary, my love.    Aren't we in recovery?   This? It's just bubbles.  We're not gonna shoot it up, are we? You really have a way.  You know that? A way of what?   Of whatever the hell you want.    Well, here's to 10 more glorious years of whatever the hell I want.  Hi, I'm Cody, and I researched Saudi Arabia   for my cultural report.    That's good, sweetie.  Now, look at me when you talk, and try and stand up straight.  My board is covered in sand because Saudi Arabia is one big desert.  One great big desert.  One great big desert.  It only rains in a tiny corner of the country, so they save rainwater Okay, try and keep your fingers off your face.  You don't want people to think you're picking your nose.  You mean like this? Cody, you need to take this seriously.  Dexter said it should be fun.  Dexter does drugs.  He's wrong.  I finished my homework.  For the week? Hey, I'm home.    Mom!   Sorry I'm late.  I'm so happy to see you! Mom! What a greeting.  Okay, why don't you guys go get ready for bed?   Really, mom? I just got home.    They need their rest.  I will be in in just a minute to check on you.  Those two are making great progress.    Progress towards what?   Their full potential! I know you're good at these things, but now that you're here, have you thought about applying for a teaching job? No, I'm through with the schools.  Well, I thought teaching was your life.  And your children are going to be the beneficiaries of all that I have to offer.  Our injunction stopped The Tribune from publishing the manifesto for now.  At the very least, we'll have time to get a jump on things before the news frenzy hits.  So, let's take advantage of this window.  Our goal for the next 48 hours is to wade through this shining piece of social commentary.  I've never seen so many dense and convoluted ideas in my life, but we need to search them all for clues to his identity.    So, first impressions?   I got something.  There are a lot of literary references in this document.    How do you know?   I like to read books.    What kind of books?   All kinds.  Who cares? Anyway.  I see lots of references, like this one.  \"You can't depend on your eyes \"when your imagination is out of focus. \" He's a Trekker! That shit's straight from Deep Space Nine.  What? Mark Twain said that.  It's one of his most famous quotes.  Twain was never on Deep Space Nine.  He was on Next Generation.    He didn't say it on Star Trek.    So what's it from? \"A connecticut yankee in king Arthur's court. \" What other literary quotes are in that manifesto? This guy, he's the best boxing student I have ever had.  After four weeks, he's getting in shots to my head.  Finally he says, \"I think I'm ready. \" I'm like, ready for what?\" And he says: \"To kick my mom's ass. \" I'm like: \"You're learning how to box \"because you want to beat up your mom?\" What the fuck? Did you hear what I said? I was gonna hit the showers.    I'll meet you back here in 10 minutes.    Okay, yeah, 10 minutes.  Who the fuck are you? I'm Lila.  Pardon my tits.  We thought you were crashing at your boyfriend's tonight.  We? We who? Dexter and I.  Could you wait here a minute? Who's the skank?   Did knocking occur to you?   Who is she? And are you trying to fuck her or set her on fire? I didn't do this to you when you were riding square jaw guy with the handcuffs.  That's different.  I wasn't cheating on anyone with Gabriel.  How could you do this to Rita, not to mention her kids?   You're like their father.    Rita broke up with me, okay? You fucked up, Dex big time.  Excuse me.  Don't worry.  She just needs some time to adjust, that's all.  I had officers tear apart the stepfather's house No murder weapon, but he had to hide it somewhere.    Where's Wilson now?   Interview room 2.  We still have him?   Why didn't his lawyer post bond?   Well, he tried, but I pulled in a favor at the court and got a bail enhancement, so they had to start the paperwork all over again.  I'll break that cocksucker today.  What evidence you say we got on this guy? He was dripping in the victim's blood.  He was home alone with her.    They fought the morning of the murder.    Circumstantial.  But the blood spatter on his shirt was a result of a blunt force beating.  I'd like to see the blood report.  You'll get it as soon as I do.  If you're looking for me, I'll be questioning the suspect.  They're still playing my tune.  It's like I'm conducting a final symphony, \"requiem for demonic Dexter,\" and forming the entire brass section sergeant James Doakes.  When I reach the end, maybe I can lay to rest the monster formerly known as Dexter.  Just hang in there, Mr.  Wilson.  I've asked a psycholinguist at M. I. T.  to analyze our manifesto.  His computer tabulates punctuation, misspellings and sentence structure to identify a set of key words, which he'll use to create a profile of our killer.  Complicated.  Stay on it.  Okay, we've been at this too long.  It's 1:00.  Let's break for lunch.    Are you alright?   Yeah, I'm fine.  Anything you want to talk about? No, not really.    If you change your mind.    It's my brother.  He was dating this chick, supersweet, a little doe eyed.  But, God, for him, fucking perfect, and he just threw her away.  I'm just pissed at Dexter, not to mention my boyfriend, who did absolutely nothing wrong.  But every time he opened his mouth last night,   I wanted to fucking slap him.    You've been listening to Chopin.  Yeah, I downloaded a Chopin.  \"Nocturne Number 2 in E flat major. \" One of my favorites.  It can have this effect on people.  It can stir up some dust.  No shit.  Listen, you can heal yourself, sir.  You just need to talk to me.  Get it off you, otherwise, it'll haunt you for the rest of your life.  Why don't you just listen to me? I didn't do this.  You can't say it and make it true.  You have a conscience, and it's really fucking with you right now.    I wish it were me.  I wish I were dead.    Yeah.  Why are we questioning that guy? He's a murder suspect.  No, he's not.  He's innocent.    What did you say?   My blood report backed his story.  Mr.  Wilson found her dead, like I told sergeant Doakes at the crime scene.  You turned in the blood report? When? I don't know, at some point before I went home last night.  I put it right on the sergeant's desk, just like he asked.  It's a green folder.  According to my findings, the mist on the stepfather's shirt was exhaled from the victim when he tried to revive her.  The autopsy confirmed she had severe internal bleeding, due to the bludgeoning.  But he could have beaten her first.  That's impossible.  The crime scene photos show blood radiating outward around the victim's body.  Such a bludgeoning would've covered the killer in blood from head to toe.  Thanks.  Mr.  Wilson, you're free to go.  Lieutenant, this man is a killer.  This man has been through enough for one day.  There's an officer in the hallway.  He'll see that you get your personal belongings back and take you home.  Thank you, ma'am.  Thank you so much.    What are you doing?   Trying to save your career.    Did you even check the blood report?   I didn't get the blood report.  It's on your desk, and it exonerates your suspect.  We should be out there looking for the real killer.  That's not what he told me at That motherfucker.    He's good.    Who? Morgan.  He planned this whole thing.  Maria, that psychopath set me up.  Dexter again? You're blaming Dexter for this? Do you have any idea how pathetic that sounds? This is not about Dexter! This is about the poor judgment you have been displaying in this department for months now!   You want to work out?   No.  I wasn't talking about the gym.  You're sweet, but I'm really not in the mood.  So, what do you want to do? I think I want to break up.  For real? Yeah.  Is that okay? No, it's not okay.  Fuck, what did I do? Nothing.  I swear to God.  You're smoking hot and fun and soulful and age apropriate.  But what? But Sometimes the truth speaks from a peaceful place.  It's taken me a long time to find that place, but I think I have, and it's telling me you're not the right one for me.  I'm so sorry.  You live in a nice neighborhood.  Yeah, I had no idea.  I'm usually passing by at 35 miles per hour.  I'm not a real big walker.  Everybody walks in London.  Of course, they're usually walking to the pub.  How far are we going? You're a bit grumpy tonight.  What's wrong? Come on.    Don't close up on me now.    No, I honestly don't know.  I mean, thanks to you, things are Actually looking up.  Some people at work have been after me.  I think I have 'em under control.  So, why the grouchiness? Is it because your sister thinks I'm a trollop? It's not just Deb.  It's the suddenness of all of this.  Losing Rita, the kids.  They've been the only thing keeping me human for a long time.  Were they keeping you human, though, or were they the ones making you feel like the monster that you were talking about? Keep going.  Your friends and family have to accept you for who you're evolving into now that you're clean.  Is that what I am? Clean? 'Cause I don't feel that way at all.  No, you certainly don't.  God.  I wish I could fuck you right now.  Whose house is this?   Couldn't tell you.    God.  He's a man of many talents.  Look.  I'm some old bitch.  Better not press our luck.  We should go.  Hi, Dexter.  Cody? Can you come to my school tomorrow? What's at your school, buddy? I'm doing my cultural report.  Saudi Arabia.  Can you watch me? I'm kind of scared.  Cody, what are you doing? Who is this? Who was that? Rita's son.  He wants me to come see him at school tomorrow.  Poor kid.  He doesn't understand that you've gone.  I think I'll go.  Whatever you think's best.  Hey, guys! I'm home!   Hello?   They're in bed.  Why so early? Cody is being punished for sneaking away to make a phone call without permission.  Astor joined him in a misguided show of support.  Well, who was Cody calling? He was trying to invite him to his school.  Can you imagine? Mom, we need to have a talk.  I made a phone call of my own today.  I spoke with Aunt Cecilia.  She told me the school district fired you almost a year ago.  We had philosophical differences.  The educational system is falling apart.  School should be life itself, not a preparation for living.  Do you know that they give trophies to every child now   whether they win or lose?   Yeah, I finally get it.  It took me a few decades, but it's not just me.  Nobody can deal with you.  You don't leave room for anybody else to exist.  It's not my fault that so many people are willing to settle for mediocrity.  Just look at you! First paul, then Dexter.  Rita, you lack even common sense, and now you're passing that torch of ordinary character on to your children.  Shut the fuck up.  Nobody talks about my kids that way.  Thatagirl.    That's what I've been waiting to see.    Yeah! I'm done with you.  No, you're not.  But you go.  You give me hell.  No, I won't do that.  I won't let you turn me into you.  Here's what's gonna happen First thing in the morning, you're gonna pack up and go home.  You'll come and visit us for birthdays and holidays, but you're not gonna live with us anymore.  Well if that's what I have to sacrifice to get you on your feet \"Kill one man, and you're a murderer.  \"Kill thousands, a conqueror.  Kill them all, and you're a God. \" Does it sound to you like our guy has a narcissistic personality disorder, a classic God complex? I think you're onto something.  To tell you the truth, I don't know what my alter ego had in mind when he wrote that crap.  I just pulled from various blogs on the net, mixed and matched Presto manifesto.  You finally decided to fight back.  I been waiting.  Hope you don't expect me to comment on that so you can record it on your hidden tape recorder.  I wasn't born yesterday.  You might have been, for all I know.  Your past is a bigger mystery than fucking Jimmy Hoffa.  I tried every avenue, legal and otherwise, but there ain't no paper trail on the early years of Dexter Morgan.  I guess there's no recorder running, after all.  No, man.  Unlike you, I do everything out in the open.  In that case, sergeant, let me put this in the open for you.  No matter what you try, no matter when, no matter how hard you work, I'll always be a step ahead of you for one simple reason.  And what's that? I own you.  Fuck! Get him off of me! Get off me! Why are you doing this? I want your gun, your badge, and your police ID.  I want your access card, too.  Now! Type a statement that sergeant Doakes is on administrative leave, pending an internal affairs investigation.  You two, get him out of here.  Thanks.  What the hell happened? I don't know.  He jumped me.  That guy's always had it out for me.    Thanks for meeting with me, Don.    I don't know what the point is.  The district court injunction hearing starts in 3 hours.  Which everyone here knows we're going to lose.  Don't look so shocked.  We always lose these things.  You bastards and your free speech.  My boss never lets me say anything.  I'll tell you what, I will agree to dropping the injunction, which will save us days of courtroom arguments and a boatload of legal fees, if we can agree on some simple ground rules on how you publish that document.  \"Ground rules\".  We're not gonna have any ground rules.  My only goal here is to avoid compromising an investigation of a mass murderer who could hurt a lot more people.  Give me just a second, will you, Frank? I can't believe you got those assholes to publish the manifesto without the victims'names and as a page 3 story.  No sense hyping it.  It might just inspire the killer to greater heights.  Wait.  It's quiet here Peaceful.  It's a good spot.  For what? It's 1:00.  So it is.  I brought my own sandwich.  I thought you didn't like the quiet, Morgan.  I didn't.  I don't.  When I'm alone and it's quiet, I get scared Shitless, like I start hearing what's really going on inside.  I see.  So if it's all the same to you, maybe I can just practice when you're around.  'Cause when you're around, I kind of feel like I can deal with anything, you know? Like what happened to me.  I don't have to run from it.  I don't have to jump into bed with some guy and hide there.  You give me strength.  I'm kind of opening up here.  What do you want me to say? I don't know.  You're the fucking Zen master.  Figure it out.  I've got plaque in my arteries.  I know the lyrics to elevator music.  My hair isn't getting any thicker.  You're gonna do great up there.  You just have to remember something.    They're more frightened than you are.    No, they're not.  Are so.  You'll be staring at them the whole time.  If one of those unsuspecting moms or dads does something embarrassing while you're on stage   Like pick their nose?   You're gonna be the one who sees it.    Yeah.    That's power.  Now go have fun.  Dexter, over here.  We saved you a seat.  Thanks, guys.  There you go.  $18,000.  I'll send a truck for the piece tomorrow.  I am telling you, Lila, this is going to create a critical mass for you.  According to the psycholinguistic analysis of the manifesto, our killer is a white male in his 50s.  What else? The killer has no girlfriends   and considers himself a good catholic.    Hold on.  How can you tell all that by putting words in a computer?   I don't know.  It's science.    How about common sense? I think the guy we're looking for is pissed off at God.  That's why he kills people.  Really? I found him very politically motivated.  Yeah, like a modern day revolutionary.  Which would suggest that he's killing for social change.  This is what he wants.    What's that?   Confusion, chaos It's what the killer wants.  He's always been an intensely private figure, dispatching victims silently.  Now he's suddenly a media whore? It doesn't make sense.    He's creating a clusterfuck.    Very good, officer Morgan.  The killer's making us chase our tails.  You know what that means? He knows how we work.  Look how he hits every major theme.  Political, environmental, religious.  In one section, he manages to weave together Julius Caesar, Berlin, Germany, the Pittsburgh steelers, and Gandhi.  It's scattershot.  He knew that this would send us scurrying like squirrels for nuts.  Yeah, but to suggest that he might be one of us How can you be sure? Hi, I'm Cody, and I researched Saudi Arabia for my cultural report.  My board is covered in sand because Saudi Arabia is one big desert.  As you can see, I used coffee beans to write \"Saudi Arabia. \" Arabic coffee is very famous.  I'm a little confused.  Lila is the one showing me how to take control, stop killing, get my life clean.  But it's the 1st time since I went into recovery that I actually feel clean.  The children in Saudi Arabia are just like us, because they This is the Saudi Arabian flag.  The Arabic letters mean \"There is no God except Allah. \" Do you know how tough it is for a woman in Saudi Arabia? They can't drive or have powerful jobs.  Or get this.  They can't even go to the movies without men's permission.  After they turn 12, they have to wear long black sleeves, and they can't hardly even talk to men until they get married.  The new king, Abdullah, is trying to change some old bad rules, so women can do more things Thank you very much for listening.  Or, as they say in Arabic, \"shokran. \" I can't believe how calm you were up there.  Yeah, you were like a professional talker.  You were pretty good.  Can Dexter come for ice cream with us? Can he, mom, please?   Sure, Dexter can join us.    I wouldn't miss it.  Maybe they'll have some delicious Saudi flavors, like sand or oil.  Hang on a sec, guys.  Are you hurt? Okay.  I'm coming now.  I know.  Me too.  Come on, kids.  Dexter won't be joining us.  Rita, it's an emergency.  Look, I'm so sorry, you guys.  I'll make it up to you, but I gotta help a friend who's in trouble.  There was a fire at her place.  I'm so sorry.  Hey, let's go.  What happened? I was working on my piece with the blowtorch, and it just caught fire.  I was so scared.  I guess so.  Promise me that you won't leave me, that you won't go anywhere.  I'm not going anywhere.  Hey, you got your light fixed.      Previous EpisodeNext Episode"

        "script": "Previously on Dexter My mother was murdered when I was a boy.  I was there.  I saw it.  for those murders.  One's deceased, one's doing life without possibility, and that's the only one that's still an open case, Santos Jiminez.  Did you have to saw her into little pieces? Did you have to leave two little boys soaking in a pool of their mother's blood? I don't care what you did.  It's okay.    Who the fuck are you?   Pardon my tits.  How could you do this to Rita, not to mention her kids? Rita broke up with me, okay? 'Cause when you're around, I kind of feel like I can deal with anything.  Your past is a bigger mystery than fucking Jimmy Hoffa.  It's time to make Doakes go away.  Sergeant Doakes is on administrative leave pending an internal affairs investigation.  The killer's making us chase our tails.    You know what that means?   That he might be one of us? I was working on my piece, and it just caught fire.  I was so scared.  Promise me that you won't leave me, that you won't go anywhere.  I'm not going anywhere.  I can't believe he said it.  Even for Masuka, it was too much.  And Batista didn't do anything.  Talk about lame, he fucking sat there.    You know how much I wanted to   Is that the sports section? I used to enjoy quiet mornings, but ever since the fire at Lila's loft, she's been crashing here a bit too often.    Is that my shirt?   I thought it was Dex's.  It's not.  It's okay keep it.  And so now I share the kitchen with a cobra and a mongoose.  Somebody drank all the coffee again.  Somebody didn't drink all the coffee.  I had a cup, Dexter had a cup, and it just kind of went like that until the pot was empty.    Deb, please.    What? Someone didn't drink all the coffee.  Stupid question.    Why are you sticking up for her?   I'm just trying to keep the peace.  Maybe we should stay at your place tonight.  Has the fire damage been repaired? The insurance company's dicking me around.    Won't pay me.    Don't worry.    I'll move out soon.    Stop leeching off your brother?   Whatever for?   Again, thanks for sticking up for me.    I am Switzerland.    Yeah, and I'm out of here.  What's this? It's the dragon zombie.    Cody likes to hide things in my bag.    He's trying to control you.  By hiding toys in your bag, you have no choice but to return them to him.  He's 7.  He seldom has thoughts more complicated than the desire for candy.  I'll see you at your loft tonight.  Honey! Honey, no.  You said we could make breakfast.    I meant cereal, baby.    I don't want cereal.  I guess I should give Rita back her key.  Cody, no.  No, let mommy get the d It's Dexter!   He brought doughnuts!   I did.  I also brought A dragon zombie! I knew you'd find it! Hope it's okay I'm here.  Could you watch them while I finish getting ready? Astor still has homework.  Thank you, Dexter.  Meet me at the car.  Good thing I dropped by.  Don't ever do it again.    Sorry?   It's too hard on the kids and it's too hard on me.  It's Paul all over again.  Please, Dexter, just stay away.  Notice we have some new faces.  Please make them feel welcome.  Our immediate task is to re examine every criminal case involving our 18 victims.    Where would you like us to start?   By answering every question as honestly and with as much detail as you can.  Excuse me, sir.    Answering questions?   That is correct.  I can hardly expect you to investigate your own cases.  What are you saying? Are we under investigation? We're now operating assuming that our killer is somehow connected to law enforcement.  Whether he be a file clerk, a dispatch officer,   park ranger   Or a police officer.  Or a police officer.  Is that why you brought in all these suits? Special agents.  Sir, you risk alienating every cop on the task force if you do this.  We go where the chase leads us Even if it gets messy.  It's insulting.  We're as capable as they are of looking into our own cases.  Who wears a wool suit in the middle of summer in Miami? Nazis.  That's who.  It's all about intimidation.  And the idea that one of us could be the killer is complete bullshit.  What do you mean? \"Us\" who? Lundy has his feds investigating all of our cases that are tied to the Bay Harbor victims.  That's good here.  We gotta stand tough here.  We gotta make it clear to them that we're not gonna be their little \"yes, sir, no, sir\" lapdogs.  Gentlemen.  I'd like to go over some of your cases tomorrow.  Got them listed there.  It would be helpful if you could gather up any notes you may have taken.  Happy to help.    Way to stand tough, Dexter.    Sorry.  That's exactly how Hitler walked.  It seems my manifesto unintentionally helped Lundy narrow his focus.  That's what I get for trying to emulate Lila and take the offensive.  I've always worked best in the shadows, and that's where I have to stay.  Lundy's really pissing people off.  He's got his whole crew looking through every case involving any of the Bay Harbor victims.    He sounds desperate.    You know you're gonna be called in.  I'll be curious to see if I show up.  Okay, James, you need to be a little careful here.  If you wanna keep your job, you gotta cooperate.  Being on suspension does not exclude you from this.  And who was it that suspended me again? Oh, shit! That was you.  Please, don't act like you didn't deserve it.  Your case is coming up for review in a week.    If you wanna keep your job   You keep saying that.  What makes you think I wanna keep my job? Are you just talking here, or is this something that you've seriously considered? Well, you and I both know that I've gone as high as I can over there.  Maybe it's time to move on.  Well, what would you do? I don't know.  My father was a butcher.  Maybe I'll open up my own butcher shop.  Yeah, I can just see you putting on an apron every morning.  Look, I have a friend.  He's the head of personnel at Stillwater security.  Government contractors.  They're always looking for people like you.  It's a dangerous world out there.  They pay a lot of money to make it safe.  Yeah, you got that right.  Alright.  Set it up.  I'll meet with your guy.  Officer Morgan.  Yes? I picked the Rodrigo case for you to look into.  Small time dope dealer.  Arrested for murder ended up walking free, then disappeared off the face of the earth until his body was found in a garbage bag in the ocean.  Not exciting enough for you? I'm homicide.  I mean, I thought you didn't want us checking into our own cases.  You're new to homicide.  At the time of this case, you were still in vice.  No conflict there.  I'm flattered you want me in on this, but Batista and Doakes were lead here.  I feel kind of weird about investigating my own colleagues.  \"Weird\".  Gosh.  I'd hate for you to feel weird.  You know what I mean.  Would you have dinner with me tomorrow night? Or would that make you feel weird? I'd love to have dinner with you.  Good.  I'll take you to the best restaurant in Miami.  Great.  I like the smell.  Don't you? Like something exciting happened here.  It's like when a piece of bread gets stuck in the toaster.  You like to pretend there's no poetry in you.  So, what's the problem with the insurance company? It's ridiculous.  They think the fire is of suspicious origin, and they need to finish their investigation.  What do they mean,\"suspicious\"? Are they saying you started the fire on purpose? Who knows what they're saying? You know insurance companies.  Anything to keep from paying out.  Especially when a fire has multiple points of origin.  So, you never told me.  How did it go at Rita's this morning? You know, I just returned Cody's toy, and that was it.  No quickie on the kitchen table? Rita doesn't have a kitchen table.  Clever way of not answering the question.  It was Awkward, actually.  Always is.  You can't go back.  You know that.  I'm not trying to go anywhere.  The bed's all ready.    I can't.    And why would that be? I have too much work to do.  I have all these case files I have to go over for tomorrow.  You didn't bring any work with you? At home I need work at home.  Goodbye, then.  So, I'll see you tomorrow? Whatever.  Is it possible she started that fire on purpose? I can't imagine why.  What I do know is that I can't take any risks right now.    At least, you wanted to   Morgan! Come in.  Can I offer you some tea? No, thank you.  I'm And he pours it anyway.  He's trying to throw me off balance, show that I don't have the power to say no to him.  How about some sesame crackers to go with that? So I'll say yes to everything.  I'd love some.  Sorry.  Guess I ate them all.  Asshole.  So, You worked firsthand on, what, four of the cases related to the Bay Harbor investigation? I believe so.  Your reports were a real pleasure to read.  Concise, meticulous.  I appreciate that.    Good.  Thank you.    Does your sister prefer meat or fish? You have more than one? Sister? No.  Just Deb.  Or is she more of a salad kind of person?   She's definitely a carnivore.    Good.  So the Rodrigo case.  Let's talk about that one.  Kind of blew it, didn't you?   I'm sorry?   Anthony Rodrigo.  Crack dealer with an apparent habit of killing people who got in his way.  I believe this was yes, Doakes' and Batista's case.  They finally tied Rodrigo to one of his victims, built a solid manslaughter case, would have got him off the street for a few years.  But the case largely rested on the bloodwork that you did.  Bloodwork that in the course of the trial was proven to be, well wrong.  So, you one of the most cautious and precise forensic specialists I've had the pleasure to work with, you performed bloodwork that directly led to Rodrigo walking free.  I asked myself, \"how the hell did that happen?\" And did you answer: \"Dexter blew the case on purpose \"so that he could get Rodrigo off the streets for good \"with a cordless reciprocating saw\"? I'm sorry.  You've caught me off guard here.  Sloppy bloodwork.  This wasn't my idea.  Could have said no.  Come on, Angel, we have a job to do.  Since when my job is trying to prove to a fellow police officer I'm not a killer? That's not about that.    What is this about?   It's about finding someone who had motive and opportunity to kill all 18 of our victims.  No way it's anybody in our department.  Then help me prove it.  Go through the Rodrigo case with me.  It is not just you.  LaGuerta's cooperating on her old cases.  Even Matthews is coming in.  The Rodrigo file.  You just happen to have it with you.  I'm a reasonable man.  You know how it is.  The defense attorneys bring in their so called blood experts to counter everything I say.  I'm familiar with the process.  I understand how this may look like sloppy bloodwork to the layman.  That's what Rodrigo's defense convinced the jury of.  But as you can see, the low velocity blood drops clearly point in the direction opposite to that in which we know Rodrigo to have fled,   which makes it impossible   Except those low velocity drops were revealed to actually be 90 degree passive drops that were given tails due to the angle of the floor.  Perhaps, but if you then examine   the blood trail   Which we know isn't a blood trail, but projected blood.  You're not winning me over here, Morgan.  The truth? By all means.  I was overworked.  I was carrying half a dozen cases at once.  It was a heat wave means a spike in homicides.  This one got pushed aside.  I didn't write up my summary until an hour before the trial.  I obviously overlooked a few things.  A murderer walked free because you were overworked? Yes.  Who's this guy? Lenny Asher.  Lenny? He's a nutjob But it says he lived next door to Rodrigo, filed all kinds of complaints.  But he filed complaints about everybody.  He sat at his window all day and call us every time he saw someone move.  He called us once to say there was something weird about the clouds.  Still no harm talking to him, right? Lenny Asher? Who the hell are you? Detective Batista.  This is officer Morgan.  We're with the Miami metro homicide.  Can we come in? Who's dead?   Anthony Rodrigo.    I know.  They found him in the ocean.  I hope a whale ate him and shat him out, and then ate him again.    You weren't too close to him, right?   He was scum! Yeah, you made numerous calls about him when he used to live here.  He was a drug dealer.  He played loud music, urinated on my lilies.  You actually saw that? They were dead.  That's all I needed to know.  Any thoughts as to who might have killed him? How the hell should I know? Look at that joker parked right in front of the fire hydrant.  I got his license plate, though.  That would be our car.  You take a lot of notes? Anything hinky happens outside this window,   I note it.    How long you been doing that? Since someone stuck a nail in my tire.  March 1998.  Rodrigo was last seen alive the day after his trial.  April 16, 2002.    Think you took any notes that day?   If something happened, I did.  You still have those notes? Here.  2002.  What kind of order did you put them in? I told you: 2002.  I have no idea if Lundy bought my excuse.  Either way, it makes me a little anxious to see my sister looking through the Rodrigo files, Looking for me.  You're never gonna guess what I found.  What did you find? An apartment.    Great.    One bedroom near 78th and Harding.  Big change.  It's time, you know?   Good for you.  When do you move?   As soon as possible, but not tonight.  I have a date.  I thought you broke up with Gabriel.  It's someone new.  Lundy.  Lundy, special agent Lundy? He's at least 20 years older than me.  What do you care? I don't.  I mean I'm sure you wouldn't do anything like that.  What are you talking about? Do what? Like try to sleep your way to the top.  You douche.  That is so not true.  No, of course not.  I shouldn't have even said anything, and I'm sure that thought would never even occur Double douche! You are not allowed to talk about anyone I date as long you're seeing little Miss \"pardon my tits. \" I am sorry, Dex, but she is gross And pale, and nobody is pale in Miami.  She is obviously a vampire.  A gross english titty vampire.  You just described the perfect woman.  Truth is I need to avoid Lila for now.  Harry taught me that the key to survival was staying one step ahead.  But Lundy almost trapped me today.  I can't be unprepared like that again.  Hey, it's me.  Why aren't you here? I'm starving.  I thought you knew.  It's my bowling night.  Bowling? Really? What, like Fred Flintstone? I'm more in the Barney Rubble category.  How fun.  I'd love to watch you bowl.  It's not really a spectator sport.  Well, I'll close my eyes.  But it's sort of the guys'night out.  Come on, Dex, I want to meet your friends.  Where is it? What time is it? Give me the address.  Starlight lanes.  1690 Michigan avenue.  7:00.  I guess I'm going bowling.  Go, Dexter! He only got three pins down.  I like to celebrate the little things in life.  If you like little things, I'm your man.  I mean, I'm not little everywhere.  Some places I'm just perfectly average.  You are perfectly adorable.  Why you got a hug and I got a pat on the nose? 'Cause you're like a retarded puppy.  Your ass does the cutest little thing when you bowl.  If you guys will excuse me, i need to use the ladies'room.  She's pretty hot.  Yes.  She is.  Nice place.  Very Gray.  Yes, the bureau have always been known for their fashion sense.  Honestly, all I care about is the kitchen.  You cook? Like I said, best restaurant in Miami.  Really? You're gonna cook for me.  Well, don't ever expect me to return the favor Unless you're a big fan of toast.  I would love to eat your toast.  Gosh, that sounded wrong.  So, what's for dinner? Steak florentine and grilled potatoes italian style.  Fucking a.  There's that mouth again.  I'm sorry.  It's just the way I talk.  And if we're gonna be together, you better get used to it.  Can't change who I am.  I'm crass and dirty, and I have a very filthy mind.    You're also pretty adorable.    I know.  Now start peeling potatoes.  I like a man that takes control.  Wash your hands first.  You're so turning me on.  You know, considering our age difference, you're not too old to spank.  No, stop.  Please.  I can't control myself.  My God! Sure you don't wanna grab a beer with us? Nah, thanks.  I'm tired.  I hope you saved enough energy for me.  That doesn't look like the look of love.  Sorry.  I really am tired.  I think I'm gonna go home.  Help! Help! Somebody please come! God.  You OK?   Dexter, you're bleeding.    It's not deep.    I mean, what the hell?   He tried to grab my watch.  It's stupid.  I should have let him have it.  It was reflex.    Sure you're OK?   Yeah, I'm fine.  Jesus Christ.  They sell anyone a gun in Florida, won't they? Yeah, I know.  Scary, right?   Anyone get a license plate?   No, it was all too fast.    You want us to take you to a doctor?   No.  Really, I'm fine.  I'll take care of him.  So who was it? Who? That man.  He wasn't trying to rob you.  He was trying to kill you.  Santos Jiminez, the man who murdered my mother.  My God, Dexter.  He must have followed me to the bowling alley.    If you hadn't have seen him in time   I saw him.  That's all that matters.  None of this scares you? Nothing you could do, Dexter, would scare me.  I believe you.  Come here.  Whatever comes, we'll get through this together.  I'm not leaving your side, Dexter.  I'm not leaving yours.  Really? Why would you think that? You've just been a bit distant lately.  I get that way when I'm stressed.  What are you stressed about? Right now, nothing.  Do you think Dexter will come for breakfast tomorrow? I don't think so, honey.  Well, maybe we should call him.  It's kind of late.  But Dexter stays up late.  She doesn't want to call him.  Why not? Dexter and I broke up.    Why?   They don't like each other anymore.  That's not true.  Does that mean he doesn't like us either? No.  Of course he likes you.  It's just That's hard.  When two people break up.  It makes them sad to see each other.  I don't think Dexter's gonna be coming for breakfast for a while.  Sorry.  Lila may be the right woman for me but she's wrong about one thing.  Recovery simply isn't an option.  When I let my guard down, I open myself up for attack or capture.  I need to embrace who I am, who I've always been.  I need to kill the man who murdered my mother.  I'd almost forgotten this feeling Driving toward a kill, all my senses sharpened.  It's like I've been living underwater, holding my breath, and now I can finally breathe.  So how come it's so suffocating in here?   It's nice to see you.    Yeah, feels all warm and comfy.  I spoke to Todd about you.  Yeah? He's very interested.  He said someone with your special ops background typically starts at about $200,000.    I could live with that.    You can meet him tonight.  I'll be there.  I appreciate your time.  Can we get this over with, sir? It's interesting that of the 18 victims, and you worked on cases involving 4 of them.  And you were unable to obtain a single conviction.  The Smith case thrown out because of inadmissible evidence.  Orozco skipped bail, never to be seen again.  The Rodrigo case lost due to bad bloodwork.  Excuse me? You weren't aware of that? The D.  A.  Didn't get a conviction.  That's all I know.  Are we through here, sir?   No, actually.  We're just   We're done.  Look at this.  \"June 1st: Mrs.  Holcomb takes out trash, \"drops soda bottle, doesn't pick it up. \" \"March 17th: \"airplane flying too low. \" I told you, this guy's a fruit bat.  \"April. \" It's the month we want.  \"April 16th\" Fuck me sideways, listen to this.  \"Rodrigo gets into car parked in wrong space.  \"Must be drunk because someone's carrying him. \" The plate's here.  This is from 9:00 the night he disappeared.  Last time he was seen alive.  We gotta run that plate.  Whoever owned this car is our killer.    I'll get Lundy.    He's out with his Feds.  I'm calling him in.  Lila almost had me believing it was possible to change, to become something else, as if that ever really happens.  I've always known what I am.  \"If the glove fits\" A secret cabin in the middle of the Everglades.  What more could a rededicated serial killer ask for? Cocaine.  Apparently Mr.  Jiminez never gave up his old habits.  What a bad, bad man.  What? You think it just turned on by itself? \"There is no such plate. \" Is that a 1 or an \"i\"? Fuck you, Lenny.  Fuck your handwriting.  Kind of busy here.  Then can you please tell me where I can find Dexter? I brought him some dinner.    Dexter's not here.    Where is he? How should I know? He said he was working late.  Is that what he told you? What do you mean? He's not working late.  I think he lied to you.  Men are such pigs.  I'm so sorry.  I'm sure he'll show up.  He's very excited about this job.  I swear, I've tried every combination.  Nothing is coming up.  I told you Lenny would be a waste of time.  Maybe it's not a Florida plate.  Try Georgia.  Holy shit, here it is.  The vehicle was registered to Charlie Lewis.  I know that name.  A drug dealer out of New York.  A tough guy.  Likes to carry a big ass knife.  That's our guy.  That's the Bay Harbor butcher.  I told you he wasn't a cop.  What? Shit.  Where is he? According to this, South Bay correctional facility.    What? For how long?   Shit.  Charlie Lewis was arrested April 12, 2002.  That's four days before Rodrigo was seen being carried into the car.    Who had his car, one of his gang?   This is where it gets really bad.    The vehicle was seized as evidence.    By who? By our department.  Where was the vehicle held? Right here in our evidence lab, behind a secure gate.  Someone signed the vehicle out, picked Rodrigo up, killed him and then signed the vehicle back in.    So you have records.    Why would we keep them? The only people allowed access to those vehicles are members of the Miami Metro Police Department.  Holy shit.  Bay Harbor Butcher is one of our own.  We keep this to ourselves for now.  Just the three of us.  I'm gonna go tell it to a bottle of scotch.  Here we are again.  What what the fuck? I know.  I keep asking myself that same question.    Let me out of here!   But I'm finding it's best to accept things you can't change, you know? Normally, I'd have a chat to make sure you understand why you're here, but I think you have a pretty good idea.  Let me go.  I got cocaine.  You can have all of it.  It's funny you should say that.  I am off the wagon.  But that was never my drug.  I'll fucking kill you! No, Mr.  Jiminez.  I'm gonna kill you tonight For what you did to my mother and because, well, this is what I do best.  It's kind of fitting, don't you think? Astor, Cody, come on, let's eat.    How'd you get the door unlocked?   It was already open.  That's odd.  Dexter, hi.  Look, I'm sorry to bother you, and I'm sure this is nothing, but I was just wondering if by chance you were at my house.    Well, no.    It's just that the door was open and you're the only other one with a key.  Rita, get out of the house.  Call the police.  I'll be there as soon as I can.  I can't leave you here.  I can't take you with me.  Don't go anywhere! Hey, I'm sorry to drag you into this.    No, I'm glad you called.  The kids?   Next door.  The place is empty.  No sign of forcible entry.  I'm guessing you just forgot to lock the door.    If you need anything else   No, you're not leaving.  Sir? Someone was in this house.  I need you to stay here in the house until I tell you it's safe.  Really? I need to do those things? I'm with Miami metro homicide.  I know you don't take orders from me, but if you like, I could get lt LaGuerta on the phone.  If you prefer to speak to cpt Matthews, I can arrange it too.    Dexter, what's going on?   Please, just stay here, okay? It's one thing to fuck with me, another to fuck with my ex girlfriend who hates me.  The Lila experiment is officially over.  Give me Rita's key.  Well, that's your fault, isn't it, Dexter? You lied to me about working late, and I thought I might find you there.  Do not ever go to Rita's house again.  Do you understand? Do you understand? Is this the monster that you keep telling me about? Trust me, when you meet the monster, you'll know.  You called Jiminez.  Yeah, I suppose I did.  Why? Why would you try to have me killed? You weren't going to get killed.  That's why I did it at the bowling, so all your police officer friends would be there.  What were you thinking? Are you insane? I was trying to bring us back together again! You were pulling away, and Remember at the hotel after you faced Jiminez? That's That's what I wanted! To bring you back! So you called him? Well, it worked, didn't it? Last night You and I You fell asleep in my arms.  What? You are more dangerous than my addiction will ever be.  That's saying a lot.  Stay away from Rita.  Stay away from me.  Or what? Or you will see the monster.      Previous EpisodeNext Episode"

I need to kill the man who murdered my mother.  A secret cabin in the middle of the everglades, what more could a rededicated serial killer ask for? It's kind of fitting, don't you think? It's just that the door was open and you're the only other one with a key.  Get out of the house.  Call the police.  I can't take you with me.  Someone was in this house.    What's going on?   Please, just stay here.  Stay away from Rita.  Stay away from me.    That's what I said.    That I'm always right? That you were right about Lila.  She was bad for me.  And that I'm always right! Hurry the fuck up! I didn't realize how bad till last night.  Hey, Vince.  How's it going? She had me fighting with myself the whole time.  All that self reflection is unhealthy.  Stop reflecting and move.  Sorry.  The fact is I already know who I am, and I'm done fighting it.  So the battle's over.  Lila's over.  Clean this mess up! It's a goddamn safety hazard.  Can't leave this shit lying around, bro.  Nice: my subconscious isn't even bothering with symbolism.  That's what I get for leaving the remains of Jimenez up in that cabin.  Bad time to get sloppy, with special agent Lundy putting everyone in law enforcement under a microscope.  What are you doing here? Just wanted to give you that.  You're in the same clothes as last night.  You slept here? Not intentionally.  I just wanted to make sure whoever broke in stayed away.  I guess I kind of fell asleep on the job.  Sorry.  Don't be.  I made a killer robot that eats airplanes.  Want to see? Mom's making pancakes.  You want bananas in yours? Actually, guys, there's something I got to go deal with, so Then why'd you come? Cause you needed one of these.  Alright, guys, Dexter's got work to do, so go eat pancakes.  Add extra bananas for me.  I didn't mean for them to find me here.  Well, it's okay.  I think they needed a hug, too.    Take care, Dexter.    Wait.  I want to say something.  I'm sorry.  Alright.  I feel Such regret, which is rare for me.  But not that I don't mess up.  I do Just never so stupendously.  I had you and them.  And I had us so much to have.  And I just demolish it, I honestly thought that I was smarter than that.  Rude awakening.  Lila's one of the biggest mistakes of my life.  It means a lot to me, Dexter.  But it doesn't change the fact that you slept with another woman.    I can't forgive that.    I don't expect you to, I just wanted to say it.  All I can do now is pick up the pieces of Jimenez.  He's one big pile of evidence.  Not that anyone will easily break into that cabin.  The thing's a bunker.  Still, I can't leave a kill lying around.  I'll have to call in sick at work.  It's not Doakes    fbi.  My feeble interview with Lundy might have put me on his short list of suspects.  Left turn to the cabin Right turn to a change of clothes and work.  Glad I'm at peace with Harry's code again.  It makes decisions easier.  Caution first, Jimenez later.  Announcing the arrival of flight 274 From Santiago, dominican republic, gate 20 B.  Your call has been forwarded to an automatic voice message system.  James Doakes Is not available.  To page this person, press 5 now.  You know what? Fuck you, James.  Fuck you and your disappearing act.  You didn't just stand me up last night.  You screwed yourself out of a 6 figure security job, which means that being a cop is one of the few options you have left.  So, stop pissing off the people that can help you.  Lundy's people have been trying to reach you.  They just want a hand with the Bay Harbor Butcher case.  James, give it to them.  Show Lundy that you are a team player.  Fake it.  And pick up when I call again.  I'm gonna keep calling.  I'm not giving up on you, James.  Your right eye is a little darker than your left eye.  And you weigh about 50 pounds.  I'm gonna have to fatten you up.  Didn't seem to bother you last night Or this morning.  So much for taking it slow? The slow part was nice.  I guess that's the perk of dating a man who's experienced.  Read \"old guy. \" Read what I said    Experienced, as in technique as in mad skills.  Are you always gonna be this touchy about the age thing? That will get old.  Sorry.  This is new territory for me.  Dating in general.  Dating someone so young in particular, And dating a coworker especially.    So I'm the more experienced one, cool.    You've dated coworkers? Not that experienced.  Well, I've seen enough of them to see where they go wrong, And experience tells me that full disclosure is the best way to go.  What, like Tell people at work? I'm an aboveboard kind of guy, And in the history of office romances, sneaking around has never worked.  I don't know.  Things are just so tense around the station right now.  So you're worried about making people tense? I just think the timing is bad.  Maybe we should wait until we can When? Notify D. C.  Then get Cal to go sit on Mendelsohn until he signs.  And then call the field office and get me more bodies.  Well, we need to move on this now.    What's up?   Not sure.  Something break on the Butcher? I gotta go.  There's quiche.  Eat it.  Wait! Shouldn't we finish talking about this whole full disclosure thing? Lundy's bees are buzzing.  Something has agitated the hive.  My money's on Connolly down in property.  Looks like much ado about something in there.  Lundy's got a suspect for the Butcher, And bro, it's one of us here.  That'   disturbing.    We're not sure Lundy picked someone, but if he has, it isn't one of my people.  Sorry but I confirmed it myself last night.  It's someone in this house.    Who in this house?   I don't know, but something must've broke cause Lundy shut us P. D.  out of the task force, brought more feds in.  So he definitely has someone in his cross hairs.  Why not Steinbauer in impound? He's a freak.  I bet it's Wykoff from records.  What about Loring in narcotics? Or it could be that murderous Morgan in blood spatter.  Maybe I was being watched this morning.  But they'd do more than watching if they had proof.  What's going on? You tell us.    Why would I know?   You're Lundy's pet.    Fuck you!   Seriously, what's he got, or is he blowing smoke? I don't know.  But if he's got something, it ain't smoke.  He's too good to blow smoke.  Man, no wonder you're his pet.    Fuck you twice!   OK, enough.  If you're not on the task force, you're clearing cases for the day.  Yes, you too.    We've got company.    Yeah, I noticed.  Not there.  In there Waiting for you.  Lundy brought in his own forensic techs.  What are they looking for? Think they'd tell me? I'm just the LFI.  Lead forensics investigator.  Or at least I used to be.  Well, fuck them.  They can have their fucking title and the acronym that goes with it.  Fucking Indian givers! In the flesh.  I need your access code for the forensics database.  Walk me through your filing system.  I'll need a breakdown of procedure and protocol.  Something particular I can help you with? We just need your help navigating the lab.  Your code, please.  May I? If they're looking for proof, they won't find it.  Not here at least.  I may have briefly rebelled against Harry, but I learned my lessons well.  Come on, Dex.  Tell me.  Make sure they deserve it.  This is life or death stuff.  It's that important.  Why do you think I pulled all those strings to arrange this? Dexter, now, come on! Tell me.  What is the number one rule?   Don't get caught.    And what are all the other rules for? So I don't get caught.  You ready for this? I'm ready.  Why are they looking at us like that? They don't know why you're here, why you need to see this.  But I want this seared into your mind, son.  The chair? The chair? Cross check our data with Interpol.  See where it leads.  Yeah.  So, bats out of hell move slower than you did this morning.  I know.  I'm sorry.    But as you can see   Something's up.  Something's up.  'Cause I wondered if maybe you were also cheesed about my whole not disclosing thing.  I don't want you to think I'm unsure or embarrassed or anything.  Why would you be embarrassed? I'm hot.  Yeah, you got that right.  Look, it had nothing to do with you, except that it made you feel bad, which wasn't my intention.  It's just   Something's up.    Something's up.  What?   I really can't tell you.    Why not? Honestly, you don't want to know.  It's a ghost from my past.    I wasn't sure I'd be able to find you.    I'm in the phone book now.  Last place you look, hey? It's good to see you, Leones.  My father in law will be happy we have a customer with American dollars.  Looks like you're in the travel business now? Orbitz, man.  It's killing us.  And people only think of Haiti for war and poverty.  But the brave ones still come.  We arrange tours between the islands.  No more sneaking people over the border at night? My wife would castrate me.  I work only for her father now.  The man is satan on wheels.  I hope the dog will bite him.  So, what can I arrange for you? Maybe the rosewood resort on little Dix? Only the best for my old friend.  I was thinking more like the hospital in Dom.  Rep.  You are sick? But I need a discreet lab.  A relaxing cruise is better.  There's a shuffleboard tournament On the Jewel of the Seas.  Big stakes.  You were always the one to see, no questions asked, whenever we needed shit.  I am not a fixer anymore, And you are not in black operations.  I'm a travel agent, and I like it.  No one tries to kill me or torture me except for him, With his vicious dog and foul breath.  Listen, this isn't dangerous, man.  I just need some blood slides analyzed.    Leones, I need your help.    This is all you want? The slides analyzed? And your most expensive tour package of the islands.  Give me the slides.  I'll see what I can do.  Confirm the arrangements first.  I'll bring them by boat.  Avoiding customs.  Don't want to risk it with biological materials.  Just tell me, James.  Are you in trouble? But someone else is gonna be.  That takes us through Ninety four.  How far back are you looking? Let's start with knife wounds.  To search by cause of death, go to the upper right hand It's okay.  I'm good.  They're wasting their time here.  If they had a warrant for my apartment, they'd find blood slides and killing tools.  Got to move those.  Gotta dispose of Jimenez.  Instead, I'm waiting for the fat man to sing.    Why don't I   I've got it.    It'll be faster   I've got it! I think we'll get along on our own from here.  And he sings.    I'm wearing green underpants.    Are you? But when he bought'em, they were white.  Too much information! Look who's come out of his cave.    Lila, what are you doing here?   She came to see me, bro.  Angel mentioned he needed a decorator, and, well, a slot just came up, so I gave him a call.    I've always wanted a decorator.    Come here.  She's not really a decorator.  It's not really my apartment that I want decorated.  So, hey, the boys here have persuaded me to go for a drink.    Or 10.    God.  Should I be worried? Yes.  You should.  Then maybe you should come with us, because who knows what secrets will come pouring out of me once the drinks start flowing.  I have 2,000 square feet that needs a total makeover.  You got 800 if you count your parking space.  She can do it twice.  I have to get to Jimenez, but a dead man tells no tales.  A drunk, unstable woman very well may.  but do you call me Paddy the road builder? No.  And me, with my 2 hands, I built the town library.  But do you call me Paddy the library giver? But you fuck one little goat   Alright.  I got one.    Stop.  What? It's a good one.  Knowing you, it'd be inappropriate in front of a lady.  She just did a goat fucker joke.  You're such a protector, angel.  I do my best.  Like that time that you came to Dexter's rescue at the bowling alley.  You just ran right towards that mugger, No thought for your own personal safety.    That's my job.    Mine, too.  It is not.  Don't do it, Lila.  Don't bring Jimenez up.  Did they ever catch that guy? Yeah, Dex, did you ever file a report? I can still look into it.  I'm sure he's long gone by now.  Anyway, I'm gonna go to the loo.  The loo? How cute is that? It's right? What the hell do you want? I'm concerned.  When someone quits their sponsor,   it means they're using again.    Quit the sponsor bullshit.  I'm done with it and you.  Did I not make that clear last night? It's out of order.    There's still work we can do together.    No, there isn't.  I am who I am, And I don't want you coming anywhere near me or my addiction.    Do you understand?   Oh, I understand how lonely you are.  Those friends of yours, they didn't even know you.  They just see the mask, but I see it all.  I can see how upset you are.  No, really? It's more than just me that's eating at you.  There's something else.  You don't have to handle it alone.  I can help.  I know how heavy that mask is, how tiring.  I'm the only one who can see behind it, and it doesn't scare me.  It's like looking in the mirror.  It's why we belong together.  Hey, asshole, it's ladies only.    My mistake.    He giving you trouble? A little.  But I know he'll see I'm right.  I know you will.  You are not driving.  Fuck you.  Fine.  Can't live with her.  Can't kill her.  She's not going away.  Neither is that undercover car.  So much for paranoia.  Those feds are real.  Lundy found my slides.  It's over.  You're out of shampoo.    Sorry.  Yours is better than mine.    What are you doing here? My new place isn't ready.  I don't wanna make a habit of staying at Lundy's.  What if people find out? It'd be a new reason to disrespect me.  They may already know.  They keep assuming I've inside intel.  They're always asking me what Lundy knows.  What does he know? Tell me.  Fuck! I'm talking about my feelings.  What the fuck is your problem? I know he's old, and it's complicated and whatever, but I feel like he's someone I can count on.  Good.  You should have that, 'cause I won't always be Who the fuck is that at this hour?   Deb, don't.    What the fuck? Special agent Lundy wants to see you.    Please come.    Wait.  Lundy didn't say anything about this to me.  I'm sorry, Deb.  I'm on the fucking task force.  I demand to know what I'm right behind you.  They're calling us in.  I'm right behind you.  We got him.  I should be panicked, terrified, but Lila was right.  The mask has been heavy.  I won't need it in surrender.  I can let it go.  The pain will come when Deb finally understands who her brother really is.  Rita's horror, the kids' tears.  My old friends, here to betray me.  Please sit down.  I'm sure you heard we have a suspect in the Bay Harbor Butcher case.  Put them on.  We now have the evidence to back it up.  We need answers, now.  Open it.  Explain it to us.  Trophies.  That's what I thought.  What happens now? I know this will come as a shock to you, Morgan, but our primary suspect is someone you know well Sgt James Doakes.  He was the lead case investigator on 4 of the Butcher victims, which put him on my radar.  We looked into his background.  It turns out his father was a butcher and abusive.  Doakes was also a trained assassin in special forces.  That along with his on the job shootings and excessive force citations   He fits the profile.    Yes.  He has a need to dole out personal justice.  Yesterday, Doakes walked out of an interview and disappeared.  This morning, we were alerted he boarded a plane out of the country.  That enabled me to get warrants on his apartment and car.  He had the slides? Carefully hidden in the trunk of his car at the airport.  It all makes so much sense.  Everyone else in the precinct was beyond shocked when I told them.  What exactly is Sergeant Doakes' problem with you, Morgan? I kill people, for one.  But what was it Sergeant Doakes said about me? I've always sensed there was something off about him Like he's hiding in plain sight.    I never concealed my doubts.    So he attacked you.  Well, he might try it again.  Particularly when he finds out he's our prime suspect.  Yeah.  That should piss him off.  We've tried to keep an eye on you from a distance.    The undercover cars.    Not undercover enough, obviously.  I'm sorry for the abrupt pickup tonight, but from here on out, we'll want a protective detail on you at all times.  That could complicate my life.  Dexter, it will keep Doakes at bay.    Good point.    What happens now is we need you to analyze and match these slides immediately.    Me?   I'm keeping the forensics in house.  The public needs to see our strength now.  Their trust in us is about to take a major ass fucking.  I make you 1st forensic tech in the chain of custody with these slides.  I figure you have more motivation than most to see Doakes brought to justice.  So I know you'll be thorough.  The TSA is circulating Doakes's photo to all major airports.  Sergeant Doakes He peeked behind the curtain.  He saw who I am.  But it only put him in the line of fire.  There's an APB out on the eastern seaboard.    I still don't believe it.    'Cause it's not true.    I don't know   Don't, Vince.  Just don't.  I didn't know.  I swear Lundy didn't tell me.  I believe you.  Big fucking manhunt mobilizing out there.  We'll get him, Dex.  And when you do, my story has to be stronger than his.  Don't worry, I'll be with you every step of the way.  Me and this.    I have an even bigger favor.    Name it.  Move into that new apartment of yours.  If you got in the middle of this and you got hurt Hurt? I'm a fucking cop.  You're my sister, and I'm gonna worry like a brother, not a coworker.    Don't.  You have enough to worry about.    I can't help it.  The best thing you can do for me is to get me and my protective detail a wide berth.  Fucker.  Fine.  I fucking hate it, but I get it.  One less pair of eyes to worry about.  You just can't get rid of me, can you? LaGuerta.  You know I didn't do this.  You know me, Maria.  That's not me.  Yeah, but they don't.    What do they have on me?   They found something in your car.  Oh, shit.  The longer you stay out, the worse it gets The only way I can help you is if you turn yourself in.    No one will listen without proof.    Of what? I don't want to pull you into this.  The next time you see me, they'll be no doubt.  Until then, you won't be able to contact me.  Don't you disappear on me.    Maria, I have to do this.    God damn! Listen to me.  I want you to know that you meant a lot to me, more than you know, and I just want to thank you for that.  What does that mean? Wait! Looks like I won't find any prints or DNA on this box.  I can chalk it up to how careful Doakes is.  Harry had strict rules about not hurting the innocent, and for all his fury Doakes is innocent.  But there's also the n\u00b01 rule: don't get caught.  Still, he'll fight this, and I'll have to disprove him.  He could win Or he could end up paying for my crimes.  Morning.  Mr.  Morgan? Special agent Lundy thought you might need our help.  Please come in.  Sorry about all the secrecy yesterday.  We were reviewing sergeant Doakes'cases, and, well, you understand.  I need you to do the liquid extractions and centrifuging on these samples.    The cells just started digesting.    Then we'll come back in 12 h.  The samples should be watched at all times.  Don't let anyone in or out of the lab, and don't let the incubator dip below 37\u00b0.  And please, don't touch anything.  You understand.  That was satisfying.  Are you okay, man? This shit with Doakes is crazy.    Yeah.  I have to go.    Hold on.  Are you pissed or something about Lila and me?   Oh, yeah.  That.    I don't want it getting between us.    If you still want her   God, no.  Lila's insane, destructive.  A naturally occurring disaster.    So you don't mind if I go for her.    What? No.  Look, Angel, here's the real truth.  Lila's just using you to get at me.    So what?   \"So what\"? No one's used me for good or bad reasons since my wife divorced me.  Damn sure no one as hot as Lila.    You may be missing my point.    Look, first it was the divorce, then getting stabbed was no picnic.  And now this thing with Doakes? Dark days, my friend, too dark.  Man, I need a light at the end of the tunnel, and Lila's it, alright? Alright, then.  Angel just doesn't get it.  Lila's no solution.  She's a problem Shall we? just like my little groupies.    I couldn't tell you.    Even with my brother at risk? We had him covered.  It would've forced you to divide your loyalties, plus, I didn't want to appear to favor you.    They all think you favor me anyway.    Maybe because I do.    You think they know?   Not until you tell them.  Special agent Lundy?   You give Doakes to the press?   Best way to bring him in.    If you publicly accuse him   I'm not accusing anyone.  Doakes is wanted for questioning, that's what my press release says.  It'll still destroy him.  He's doing a fine job of destroying himself.    He's not your man.    He is, however, my prime suspect.  Look.  I'm willing to work with you on this, but only if you let me take lead with the media.  Lieutenant, I am not letting you anywhere near the media.  He may be your ex partner, he may be your best friend.  What he is to me is a suspect.  So you deal with that however you need to.  And you will give me your complete cooperation, or you may find yourself out of a job.  It's mine.  Hey, it's me.    I wasn't sure I should call.    I'm glad you did.  It's probably best I move on, but the kids were so happy to see you yesterday, and I wasn't you know, unhappy.  Well, that's good, right? I just I need to know one thing.  Is it over with Lila? Yes, absolutely, completely over.  If I never see her again, it'll be too soon.  I have feelings for you.  I have feelings for you, too.  I'm not gonna fight them anymore.  I think we should get together and talk.  Tonight? That would be great, really great, but tonight's No, this is a bad idea.  No, Rita, it's the best idea you've ever had.  But we've got a big break in the Bay Harbor Butcher case.    Things are kinda intense around here.    Did they catch him? Someone's gonna go down for it.  But tomorrow would be really great.    Tomorrow.    I'll look forward to it.  We're getting together tomorrow.  Communication's the key.  The light at the end of the tunnel.  All clear.  We'll have a man stationed at the front and side doors and 2 in the parking lot.  Just give us a yell if anything arises.  Nothing's gonna arise, certainly not me, not until tomorrow morning.  I'm exhausted.  Don't let anyone near this door for any reason.  Shoot them if you have to.  No problem.  Sleep tight.  Sleep would be nice, but there's too much to do.  The good news is my new friends will keep Doakes away.  The bad news is they make getting to Jimenez difficult But not impossible.  Fortunately, a car isn't the only way to reach the Everglades, and my new marina's only a 20 minute walk.  I'm on my way, Jimenez.  Don't decompose just yet.  I'll be against the current on the way back.  With bagging, cleanup, and detour to the Gulf Stream, tight, but I should be home by daybreak.  It's time to get you out of my life once and for all.    You gotta talk to Lundy.    About what? Get him to hold off on putting Doakes on the news.  Maybe you should talk to Lundy.  You're one of us.  Doakes is one of us.    He deserves the benefit of the doubt.    Look, Lieutenant, I know he's your friend, and we're all pretty fucked up about this,   but it is Lundy's ballgame.    But he listens to you.    You're his right hand.    Right hand? Just say it.  Fuck the euphemisms.  And OK, I may be sleeping with him, but it doesn't mean he tells me shit or listens to me about anything, so stop asking! You're sleeping with Lundy? I'm sleeping at your place again tonight.  Just one more trip.  Ahead of schedule.  That's right, motherfucker! It's over.  How'd you find me? GPS tap on your boat.  Jesus Christ, Morgan.  Jesus fucking Christ! You're the Bay Harbor Butcher!   I really hate that name.    Jesus christ, man.    You said that.    I knew there was something with you.  But this shit? What can I say? You were right about me.  I never held it against you.  I don't now.  My buddies thought I was crazy for becoming a cop.  I had skills.  I could have written my own ticket.  And lately, I thought they might have been right, but this This makes it all worth it.    I'm happy for you.    Shut the fuck up.  Let's get this over with.  Put them on.  Morgan, you're done.  Give it up! Would you in my position? I wouldn't be in your position, you sick fuck! You sure about that? You might wanna chat with Lundy.  You shoot me, who'll prove your innocence? Maybe I'll just kneecap you.  Alright.  Nice and slow.    Back the fuck off, Morgan!   I'm just following your lead.  Slow down.  You're gonna have to kill me, Morgan! You're gonna have to fucking kill me, Morgan!       Previous EpisodeNext Episode"

        "script": "Previously on Dexter   Sorry.    It doesn't change the fact that you slept with another woman.  What do they have on me?   They found something in your car.    Shit.  Our primary suspect is someone you know well.    Sergeant James Doakes.    He had the slides.    You know me.  That's not me.    Don't you disappear on me.  What exactly is sergeant Doakes' problem with you, Morgan? I always sensed there was something off about him.  From here on out, we'll want a protective detail on you at all times.  You're a good cop like your old man.    Do you think they know?   Not until you tell them.  He is not your man.  He may be your ex partner and best friend.  To me, he's a suspect.    What are you doing here?   She came to see me.  Are you pissed or something about Lila and me?   Lila's just using you to get at me.    So what? A secret cabin in the middle of the Everglades, What more could a rededicated serial killer ask for? You're the Bay Harbor Butcher.  You're gonna have to kill me, Morgan! You're gonna have to fucking kill me, Morgan! Is it deep? I hope it's fucking deep.  It's a graze wound.  Minor tissue abrasion.  No hemorrhage along the bullet track.  Sorry.  I think I'm gonna live.  Am I? That's a good question.  If you're not gonna let me go, then kill me now.  Just get it over with.  I'd advise you not to tempt me just now.  Why couldn't you just leave me to do my work in peace? Why'd you have to go and ruin everything? You're a killer.  I catch killers.  So do I.  I caught you.  I'm not a killer.  You are.  That's why you've always known what I am.  That's why you have more officer related shootings than anybody else.  Only I don't fuck with you when you shoot somebody.  Why couldn't you pay me the same professional courtesy? There's nothing professional about what you do.  I kill when I have to on the job.  So it's okay to take a life as long as you get a paycheck for it? The city pays me to keep the law.  I've got news for you, sergeant.  My code requires a higher standard of proof than your city's laws.  At zero cost for the taxpayer? If you ask me, I'm a bargain.  That's enough bullshit, Morgan.  Let's get this over with.  Either kill me or set me free.  So? I think you'd like it if I killed you just to prove your point.    You gotta choose.    No, I need to go home.  I've got FBI guards standing outside my door right now to protect me from you.  What's it gonna be, Morgan? Kill me now or set me free! You only have two choices! You can't fucking ignore me! What's wrong? The place is a ghost town this early.  Besides, I thought we were out as a couple.  Out and flaunting it are two different things.    \"Don't ask, don't tell\"?   Works for the military.  Not really.  My subpoena for Doakes' phone records came through.    He isn't much of a talker.    Not a lot of friends, I'm guessing.  Except for one.  Check this out.  That's Lt Laguerta's phone number.  Look at the time and date.  He called her right after we launched the manhunt.    We could have traced that call.    Doubt it.  Sgt Doakes wouldn't have stayed on long enough, But Laguerta should have given us the chance.  You're gonna ream her, aren't you? Can I be there? It's a hobby of mine.  You can ream her yourself.  Me?   I can't dress down my own boss.    It's your subpoena.    Your case.    Our case.  And I need to know if your Lt can be counted on.  You know her better than I do.    Lox?   Gross.  That would just get me in deeper shit with her, and Laguerta already hates me.  I'm not always gonna be around to run interference.  Come on.  You got at least five, I mean I won't be around once this case ends.  So a reaming will be good practice for you after I'm gone.  I better refrigerate this.  Taking a life is one thing, but the care and feeding of it is another.  I can't keep my problem locked away in a cabin forever.  Harry always said there were plenty of people who deserved to die, but no matter how hard I close my eyes and wish, Doakes isn't one of them.  Harry, you never prepared me for this one.  What do I do? What would you do? Get a description of Juan Ryness to every unit in the city, and wake up judge Morehouse.  I need a warrant for Ryness' apartment now.    Fisk, make sure you get that print   She was dumped? Get back inside the car like I told you.  Blunt trauma to the head? I went over there.  No one saw.  The blow to the head killed her.  She took a brutal beating beforehand.  The guy who did this is an evil bastard.    You know who it was?   Yeah.  I've been trying to get him for a while.  A pimp named Juan Ryness.  She was one of his girls.    She was dumped, right?   Get back in the truck.  You awake?   You for real?   You got a visitor.  Coffee? Yeah.  Why not? I heard the news.  It's everywhere.  Sgt Doakes is the Bay Harbor Butcher? That's what they're saying.  I was right about you.  Are you okay? Why is the fbi guarding your building? You know the federal government.  Any excuse to spend money.  It's cold.  Sorry.  There's nothing better on a muggy Miami morning than an iced coffee, right? How are the kids? They asked about you again.  And they've been pretty confused since we split up.  Yeah.  Me too.  Are you still confused? I'm generally confused most of the time But not about us.  Good.  It's not good? No.  It's great, to have this clarity.  I'm really glad you feel that way.  The kids have been through so much lately.  With Paul's death and my mom moving out, I don't want them to feel like they've been abandoned by everyone they love.  Does this mean we're dating again? That would be kind of fast, wouldn't it? I mean, you're so important to them, and they need you.  But I don't know.  I mean, maybe we could just Hang.  Like a sloth.  I can do that.  Well, if you're free on Saturday, we're gonna spend the day at the beach, and maybe we could all hang together.  A family of sloths.  Let me get you some ice.  I've been selfish, only thinking about what happens to me.  But if I were ever revealed as the true Bay Harbor Butcher, Rita and her children would be destroyed.    I need you to take a look at these.    I know what they are.  You didn't report the call from Doakes.  Your task force doesn't need my help railroading a good cop.  Doakes was officially a person of interest.  Not reporting it could be considered aiding and abetting.  None of you wanted to hear what he had to say, so I didn't tell you.    What did he have to say?   That he's innocent.  You believe him? What do you think?   And if he calls again?   He won't.    And you know this   Because I know him.    I thought I knew someone, too.    I know him! So if Lundy wants to flag me to captain Matthews, you tell him to go for it.  But James knows that I believe in him, so it was worth the risk.  To your job? To your career? You ever care about anyone, Morgan? Then you shouldn't have to ask.  'Cause when you care about someone, you do what you have to do.  Four different aliases all issued by the DOD.  During Doakes' stint with special forces.  We've attached these names to our temporary felony want, so if he uses one, we'll be notified.  I remember when life was easy, when the only question I worried about was \"who's next?\" Now it's: \"How can I dodge my protective detail? \"What should I do with my hostage?\" These are not easy questions.  Would you bring us up to speed on the analysis from the blood slides? Of the 46 slides, 18 belonged to previously known butcher victims.  We're still running the DNA, but we've matched an additional 12 with felons in the criminal database, all reported missing.  We'll proceed on the assumption that these 12 were Bay Harbor victims.  It's a fair assumption.  Do you have the new victims' jackets? Sorry, Sir.  Not my responsibility.  That'd be me.  Each of the 12 had at least one homicide on their records, and we all know how the Butcher loves a killer.  We're checking into their last known whereabouts and any connection that their criminal cases may have had with Sgt Doakes.  Forensics, expect a steady stream of evidence seized from our suspect's apartment over the next few hours.  Look for any trace evidence that could connect him to these victims.  The rest of you have your assignments.  Let's bring him in.    Is your sister all right?   I wouldn't know.  But I wanted to talk to you about my protective detail.  Angel, I hear you have   Potential victims.    You got names? Mind if I keep this? We're all working together now.  Why? You got an angle on Doakes? That's good.  That's real good.  This is a waste of time.  If Doakes is the butcher, we won't find trace evidence on his clothes.  The guy we're after is way too careful for that.  I have to agree with you there.  You think it could be Doakes? It's not about what I think.  It's all about the evidence.  All those times he called me \"lab geek,\" \"fairy winkle\", \"donkey fluffer\" I'm just glad I took it lying down, you know? What the fuck, Dex?   What which fuck?   You got rid of your protective detail? She's gonna hit you, isn't she? She's gonna hit someone if you don't get the fuck out of here.  Hair pulling may not be manly, but it's very effective.  Doakes fucking hates you, Dex.    No doubt about that.    And he's a trained killer.  If he wanted me dead, I'd be dead by now.  It's supposed to be reassuring? He's a lot of things but he's not an idiot.  He won't come out of the shadows because of a grudge.  Right.  Cause serial killers are so practical.  Actually, they are.  I'm safer with Lundy's troops hunting Doakes   than babysitting me.  Lundy agrees.    Because he doesn't give a shit! All he cares about is solving this case and moving on! I thought he was the guy you could count on.  You are the only one I can count on, jackass.  Got to give Deb credit for one thing: She knows how to express her feelings.  If I was convicted as the Butcher, she'd probably explode.  It'd be a waste of a perfectly good cop and sister.  This isn't just about me anymore.  It's about Deb and Rita and the kids.  I have only one choice for Doakes.  Shit.  All right.  Yes.  No reason for you to suffer.  You come to a decision? Yes, but I don't think you're gonna like it.  So this is the way it ends.  Regardless of how we got here, one of the two killers in this cabin has to go away.    I am not a killer.    Right.  In terms of who goes, it boiled down to a philosophical question.  Which one of us has more inherent worth? I know you're fucking kidding me.  First I considered our value to the community.  That was a wash.  We're both loyal civil servants.  We work hard to keep the city clean.    You cut people up into little pieces.    Then I looked at our personal lives.  And well, That's where the differences became clearer.  Strange as it may seem, I have people who depend on me.  They would be devastated if they found out what I do.  You, sergeant, you're more of a lone wolf, easier to put down.  No one in the pack to miss you.  Fuck you.  Fuck you! I have a family.  I have my mother and my sisters.  Who you never visit.  It puts a pit in my stomach that I can only interpret as sadness.  If you had a personal life, you wouldn't have made me your obsession and we wouldn't be here right now.  Sergeant, why would you hide a dead drug dealer's cellphone from me? You working on an exit strategy? I'm afraid that's not gonna happen.  If you want to bring me down, you're gonna have to open this goddamn cage first.  So come on.  Bring it.  I already did.  You just didn't know it.  Mother fuck The sedative works fast.  It's probably best just to go with it.  You think you're a fucking hero, right? Cleaning up the fucking streets.  Your old man would be proud.  My old man was proud.  He knew? He really was a fucking whack job.  Name calling at this juncture? What's the point? Besides, my father was a legend on the force.  That's what you think? They never told you.  Told me? Told me what? What about my father? What about my father? A missed call.  If it's Dexter, tell him to come over.    I have Auri on Saturday.    Auri? What's an Auri? It's my little girl.  My ex never lets me see her on the weekends, but something came up.  I have her all day on Saturday.  Delightful.  But tonight you belong to me Yes.  and my walls.  Doakes said I had two choices.  Kill him or let him go.  But he neglected to look behind door number three: Hand him over to the FBI gift wrapped.  I don't need Doakes dead.  I just need his fingerprints to complete my frame job.  Almost forgot.  One needs small comforts.  Every Saturday, beginning dive classes practice underwater skills beside this dock.  Tomorrow they'll find a morbid little surprise.  When the feds receive these kill tools with their suspect's prints on them, the only threat to me will be the inane rants of a murderous madman.  So close, I can feel it.  This tragic tale might still end in Doakes' demise, but not by my hands.  Harry's legacy will remain intact.  Why in the hell did Doakes have to bring up Harry? Come on.  You just cut the cake, sweetheart.  I'll see who it is.    Tom! This is a surprise.  Come on in.    Thanks.  Sweetheart, cut the lieutenant a slice.  It's her birthday.  Happy birthday, hon.  But no cake for me, thanks.    Can I talk to you in private?   Sure.  Save me an end piece.  God damn it! Ryness is gonna walk because of a goddamn typo? Faulty warrant.  Nothing we can do.    This is bullshit!   Harry! Don't worry.    Ryness'll make another mistake.    Yeah, right.  We just wait for him to kill another girl! Sorry.  Happy birthday, kiddo.  I'll get the vacuum cleaner.  You OK, Dad? I did the right thing in training you.  This just proves it.  I did the right thing.  Will you wait?   What's going on here?   Nothing, according to you.  So I said something? Only that this relationship has an expiration date.  If you wanna write it off before it even begins, go ahead.    When did I say that?   Yesterday, you said, \"when the case ends, we end. \" I'm paraphrasing.  I thought you understood when we got involved.  I track killers.  That's what I do.    They tend to move around.    I know that.  Then I'm not sure what you thought would happen when the case ended.  Honestly, I hadn't thought about it, but it looks like you have, so now I know.  Consider me informed.  One.  How come there's never a circus when you need one? I don't know.  I'm not sure I've ever felt that particular need.  Help me out here.    What does a 7 year old girl like?   Astor likes CNN.  Yeah.  That's not gonna fly.  I got Auri all day on Saturday.  I want to do something fun.  Ideally, a lot more fun than the stuff her mother does with her.  It's really not that hard to entertain a kid.  Rita and I are taking hers to the beach on Saturday.  See, that sounds perfect.  It'd be great if we could tag along.  Sure, I guess.  We'll be there all afternoon.    Sorry, but what's with the highlights?   I was helping Lila paint her loft last night.  Red.  The color of pasi\u00f3n.  Yeah.  About Lila.  It's probably better for everyone if she doesn't come along on Saturday.  Bro, I'm not stupid.  Lila is like my after hours project.  Besides, she should stay off the beach with skin like that.  Like a perfect porcelain doll.  \"Paid 4 my lift ticket.  Where's my snow? \"Don't make me come after you. \" Sounds like Mr.  Harlow is not only a master of metaphor, but also inclined toward violent confrontation.  Better find out who he is in case I have to deal with him.  Armed with a phone number, obtaining the mysterious text messenger's I. D.  wasn't too hard, but is he a threat? \"Christopher Harlow, known alias for Jose Garza. \" \"Narcotics, armed robbery, \"and currently a fugitive from justice for murder.  \"Approach with caution. \" This guy could be trouble if he has knowledge of a certain cabin in the Everglades.  I'm safe.  Happy trails, Harlow.  Fuck! Sneak much? Sorry.  I wanted to ask you something.  That is some big hair.  Hard to believe he's our guy.  Amazing how easy it is to hide who you are from people.  Not that easy.  I was thinking about your birthday.  You got like three months.  Just get me a gift certificateat Amazon.  Good to know, but the birthday I was thinking about was when Dad threw the beer bottle.  Jesus.  Out of the blue.  What brought that up? Harry's been on my mind lately.  I was trying to remember Matthews came over that night, right? Yeah.  He and dad got in a fight.  I ended up wiping beer off the walls.  Happy birthday to me.  A killer went free.  That would upset any cop, right?   Nothing weird about that.    No, it wasn't weird.  It was just another example of dad's priorities.  Kids versus case, case always won.  Did he say anything else about it to you? Right.  Dad sitting down with me to have a heart to heart.  Not that I didn't want to.    Maybe you should have told him that.    Yeah.  Maybe.  Deb had it rough.  Harry had his hands full teaching me a trade.  But was there something else going on with him, or was Doakes just trying to shake me up? I need to know if there's more to the story.  There's a complication I don't need.    Hey, baby, what brings you back?   I have two more walls at home waiting for your expertise as a painter.  There's nothing I'd like to do more, but But what, darling? I pick up Auri, remember? We'll meet Dexter and Rita at the beach.  I have a friend at Miami art museum, teaches an incredible children's class.  Air conditioned.  Bring the whole gang if you like.  You mind if I take a rain check? With your history with Dexter, it might be a little awkward.  He tries to work things out with Rita.  Is he, now? You have a great day.  And watch out for those sand fleas.  Damn.  She better be worth it.  What was that shit last night? Some kind of fucking scare tactic? You said something before you passed out about my father.    What was it?   I don't know.  What was it? I was kind of drugged at the time.  Don't test me.  I could have killed you.  I didn't.  You didn't because you can't.  I've had time to think about this.  I don't fit that code you were talking about, do I? At first, I thought the Butcher only went after criminals because nobody gives a damn what happens to them, but now   Now I think you got a conscience.    Of course I have a conscience.  I left you a place to shit, didn't I? It's a small conscience.  You're actually angry.  I've never seen you angry.  This is good.  I might live to see the outside of this cabin after all.  What'd you say about Harry? The words \"whack job\" were involved.  Is that what you're worried about? I guess it would bother me too if it were my old man.  OK.  What the fuck? You know how I've been looking into your past, right? That's why you're in a cage.  I found something I wasn't supposed to see.    It's about your father's death.    Heart disease.  Big mystery.  No, the mystery's bigger than that.  And someone up high didn't want it solved.  You're lying.  It was buried deep, but it was there.  What was there? How about we go outside and talk about this? I could use some air.    Not gonna happen.    Yeah? Well, then the mystery remains.  I'm sure special ops taught you to rattle your captor, but I should warn you.  You can't play on my feelings.  I don't have any.  Oh, really? Who's lying now? Slow down.  That's it.    Hello, Dexter.    Captain.  Please.  I'm a civilian today.  Call me Tom.  You start your round yet? I'm afraid Bayshore is a little outside my pay scale.  So what brings you here on a Saturday morning? I wanna know if there's anything unusual about my father's death.  Go on ahead.  I'll catch up.  His heart gave out.  You know that.    I heard there was more to it.    From whom? Does it matter? I guess it was inevitable you'd find out one of these days.  You know, Harry was a good friend.  He was a great cop.  But It's a tough job.  It can wear on even the best of us.  My father was always firmly in control.  That he was, but towards the end Look, Dexter.  The system doesn't always work.  Sometimes they get away.  You know that.  And that just got harder and harder for Harry to deal with.  I think that's what did him in in the end.  What did? What am I missing here? He killed himself, Dexter.  How? The autopsy showed an overdose of his heart medicine.  That happens all the time.  People accidentally take the wrong dose.  He called me the day before he died.  He asked me to keep an eye on you and your sister.  I didn't realize what that call meant until he was gone.  So I made sure that autopsy never saw the light of day.  I was looking out for the two of you like I said I would.  I'm sorry, Dexter.  Why don't we go to the club and have a drink?   We can talk some more.    No.  Thank you.  The legendary Harry Morgan, force for justice, architect of all that I am.  Suicide? It doesn't make sense.  Special agent Lundy?   I have good news.    I could use it.  What do you got? Proof that James Doakes can't possibly be the Bay Harbor Butcher.  You're looking at the file of a stakeout James and I were on as partners Very detailed.  We were doing surveillance when one of your victims, Larry Mueller, went missing.  James and I were holed up in a motel room 24/7 for two weeks.  He didn't have time to piss, much less abduct and murder a man.  I respect your compassion for a friend and colleague, but I'm afraid this proves nothing.  It proves that he was with me.  It's all here, specific dates and times.    These are my personal stakeout logs.    And they're very thorough, but I can't use them.  No.  This is bullshit.  You gotta be fucking kidding me.  You can't ignore legitimate evidence! I can, and I will ignore it because you gave me no choice, lady.  Those are your personal logs, and your credibility was compromised when you failed to report a phone call from the subject of a goddamn FBI manhunt.  It was a breach of protocol and ethics, and you're lucky I don't bring you up on charges.  What really pisses me off is you might be right.  But in trying to protect your friend, you blew the best shot we had of bringing him in from the cold.  Come back to me if you find evidence I can use.  I smell monster meat! I got ya! I tagged you.    So?   So you're a monster now.    Really?   Yeah.  Come on, socio.  I'm sucking gas here.  Sorry, angel.  My leg's a little tight today.  It's too soon, isn't it? For this.  For us.  Rita, that's not it at all.  Then what is it? I always thought my father died of heart disease.  And I just found out that's not true.  He committed suicide.  God.  I don't know why he would do that to himself or me.  Baby Whatever Harry did and why, I can't let it distract me from my mission.  Not when freedom is so close.  \"Found out where your cabin is.  On my way.  I want my fucking snow. \" No one appreciates uninvited houseguests.  Unless I can make the problem part of my solution.  Are you Chad? It depends on what you're looking for.  Tim said to come to you.  The rohypnol.  Roofies? You? You're just not my normal kind of customer.  Do stop talking.  Good luck with that.  Thanks for coming.  I thought we should talk.  I should talk.  I mean I yell a lot and bitch and complain, and I keep expecting people to guess what I want, but I never really say it.  I'd like to hear it.  You asked me what I thought would happen when the case ended.  And the truth is I had no fucking idea.  And that was Exciting, you know? The not knowing.  What might happen, what could be.  It was all possibility.  And when you just assumed that we ended when the case ended, you crushed that.  And I want it back.  Wanna know what I thought would happen when the case ended? What? I thought the novelty of my AARP discount would wear off, and you'd get tired of me.  My God.  That's the sweetest thing you've ever said.  On our way.  What we got? A hit on one of Doakes' false I. Ds at a car rental agency.  Make, model, and license plate.  Let's go.  My hero.  This place looks like brand new.  It's my pleasure, Though I feel a little loopy from the fumes.  So how was your day at the beach? Auri wore me out.  You ever try and run in the sand? I never run.  You're a better man than me.  I'm glad you think so.  And how are Dexter and Rita? Things are good for them.  I mean I think they're gonna work things out.  We going somewhere? Well, you know, I've been trying to hold off.  But I don't know.  I don't want to anymore.  I think it's time.  I need you.  You can have me.  The thing is I like it rough.    Who the fuck is that?   Some guy I picked up in a bar.  He's a known murderer and your final victim.    You gonna do what I think you are?   There's no point in hiding it now.  Your life is going to rest in the hands of the criminal justice system you put all your faith in.    I wish you the best of luck.    Come on.  We were just getting somewhere, you and me.  You ain't gotta do this.  Come on.  We'll find a way.  I'm afraid this is the only way for me.  Excuse me.  I need to get my supplies.  You are a very bad girl.  I'm only just getting started, baby.  Be right back.  Lila, you want a beer? Jesus.  This is detective angel Batista from Miami Metro homicide.  I need an ambulance.  There is no way people are gonna believe I did this shit.  You were US special forces.  I'm sure you have done this.  Wartime circumstances, heat of the battle.  But never cold blooded.  I'm sure that made things easier for you.  Morgan, goddamn it, you got a conscience.  You said it yourself.  You go after killers.  You take out killers.  I get that.  But this is some sick fuck ritual.  You need help.  Let me help you.  Don't worry, I won't make you watch.  I'm not uncivilized.  Morgan, no! You don't have to do this! You don't have to kill this man! This man is a felon with a body count.  He brought it on himself.  Morgan, turn him over to the law.  I live by my father's law.  Morgan, don't do this! Shit.  Sorry it had to go down like this.  But there really was no other way.  Sergeant? Stay away.  Just stay away from me.  I've heard those words before Three days before my father's death.  Hey, dad.  Look what I did.  It's Juan Ryness, the pimp who killed that girl.  I finally got him for you.  Dad, what's wrong? Are you okay? Just stay away please.  Stay away.  It was me.  The idea of a code was one thing A grand idea.  A noble cause.  But the reality of it? Harry walked in on what he created And he couldn't live with himself.  What, Morgan? What now? I killed my father.      Previous EpisodeNext Episode"

Harry gazed into the eyes of his creation and saw evil, pure and simple.  My evil It killed him.  That shit about your father If you wanna talk about it About what?

I work at Good Samaritan hospital.  I'm calling on behalf of Lila Tournay.    How did you get this number?   You're on her emergency contact list.  Ms.  Tournay was rushed into our E.  R.

You'll get your chance to tell them I'm the killer, and they'll ignore you like before, and I'll   And you'll burn in hell.    Something like that.  He's gone, Dex.  Dad's heart finally gave out.  Harry's heart gave out when he saw what's inside me.  He thought he could tame it, give it a purpose, help it find a place in the natural order.  Guess he was wrong.  I need a second alone with him, okay? Thanks.  We spoke on the phone regarding your girlfriend, Ms.  Tournay.  She's not my girlfriend.  I thought she said she was.    She probably did.    So, you're It's complicated.  Look, why is Angel here? We found rohypnol, the date rape drug, in Lila's system.  With her bruising, the wound to the back of her head, we may be looking at a case of sexual assault.  No, that didn't happen.  Ms.  Tournay has no recollection of what did happen.  She's requested we perform a rape kit.  I need to talk to her.  You came to see me.  You're so sweet.  The doctors think Angel raped you.    Did he? Everything's a bit fuzzy.    This is desperate.    It won't work.    What are you talking about? I'm just glad you're here.  I missed you so much.  This is how you win me back? Framing a good man to get what you want? Which is precisely what I'm doing to Doakes.  What's the matter, Dexter? You look so sad lost.  Don't do this.  I won't press charges against Angel.  I'll do whatever you want.  If you promise to take me back.  Why can't you just let me go? Because I'm your real soul mate.  Not Rita.  Me.  I see you.  Inside.  And I'm the only one.  Look where it's gotten you.  You know that I could never do anything like that, right? You don't even have to say anything.  You warned me about her, but my dick wouldn't listen.  I could lose everything over this.  What would I say to my little girl? The doctor said Lila has 72 h to press charges.  Maybe she'll come to her senses.  I should get home and grab a few hours of sleep.  Let me get this.  No, back off.  I got it.  If I got to choose a person A real person to be like Out of anyone, it'd be you.  I'm not really sure what that means, but, thanks, Dex.  See you in the morning.  I'd appreciate it if you didn't mention this to anyone at the station.  Of course not.  Thanks.  How did it come to this? I've always gone after criminals.  Now I have the fate of two cops in my hands.  Doakes was right.  The cancer is spreading.    We're out of yogurt.    Add it to the list.    We'll stop by the store tonight.    The store's on the way to work.  It's also on the way home.  We're gonna be late.  Who joined who in the shower this morning? How about, in the futur, I set the alarm 10 min earlier? Make it 20.  \"The future\", I'm liking the sound of that.  We're being ordered to work.  You're the head of the task force, you do the ordering.  Who's D.  D.  Adams? My boss.  Mission accomplished.  The weapons I tossed into the ocean were found as planned.  One more nail in Doakes' coffin.  All right, people.  Listen up.  This is FBI deputy director Max Adams.  He just got in from Washington.  He's going to be helping us out for a while.  Once again, I have pledged our full cooperation and resources, so let's make him feel at home.  The murder weapons before you were found yesterday by a beginning scuba diving class.  The instructor contacted the FBI directly which brought them to my attention.  Fingerprint analysis ties them to one James Doakes.    This doesn't prove a damn thing.    Not now.    Why wasn't I brought in on this?   You just were, Frank.    Now, we know sergeant Doakes   Lundy better watch his back.  He's abandoned the tools of the trade that means he's probably on the run.  This footage was taken four days ago at a mobile station just off highway 41, southeast of Naples.  Ladies and gentlemen, sergeant James Doakes.  I can't believe it.  $3. 49 for regular? So, we.  have let our target get away once.  Let's not drop the ball again.  Asshole.  Highway 41 runs through the Everglades national park.  It won't be long now.  I can hang this on Doakes and then Then what? Years of trials and appeals with him pointing his finger and calling me killer? For such a neat monster, I'm making an awfully big mess.  Where does this prick Adams get off taking such cheap shots at Lundy? I heard that Doakes walked off in the middle of Lundy's questioning and that Lundy didn't stop him.  I might have heard that wrong.  Peters.  Nice hair, Borelli.  I'm sure the johns up in Boystown are loving that Duran Duran look.  What? You meatheads lose your sense of humor? Your joke wasn't funny.  We have a warrant for detective Batista's arrest.  Bullshit.  For what? A woman named Lila Tournay has filed sexual assault charges against him.  That fucking bitch! It's okay.  I knew this was coming.  It's not okay.  Captain, lieutenant! Put those away or I will shove them up your ass! What's going on here? We've been asked to bring Batista upstairs for processing I'm sure that detective Batista will go along with you peacefully.  It's not your fault.  I'll be okay.  It isn't my fault.  I warned Angel.  Still, I hate to see him disgraced in front of everyone.  And LaGuerta about to lose her former partner, her friend.  Even Lundy is caught in hurricane Dexter's path of destruction.  Maybe this is how evil works.  Destroying everything it touches including my father.  You're not gonna believe the morning I'm having.    I know the feeling.    My car is stalled on harper and 3rd.  Think you can come get me?   Hang tight.  I'll be right there.    Thanks, Dex.  I'm the helpful handyman.  How evil can I possibly be? I'm sparing Rita and Deb by framing Doakes.  Right? Over here! Thank God.  I've been held prisoner in a cabin for 2 fucking days.  Fucking hellhole.  I don't wanna go to the cabin.  I need you to get my ass out of here.  I'm a police sergeant.  Miami metro homicide.  I gotta run upstairs.  There's a whole Batista thing going on.    Lunch today?   Doubtful.  I've got to write up a status report for deputy director Adams.  Why'd they send that dipshit? Washington gets nervous when there's no movement on a case,   especially one as big as this.    No movement? You're the reason they found the blood slides in Doakes' car.  I'm also the one who let him get away.    We all let him get away.    I was in charge.  The evidence was there, but something inside me wasn't convinced he was our guy so I let him walk.  It was a bad call.    Now we might never   Stop it.    Stop what?   Acting like me.  You're a God.  Don't you forget it.  So, what do you think it is? Carburettor.  Transmission.  That round, black hose thing.  I'm more a boat guy.  The last thing I need right now is a major repair bill.  Throw in a tow and rental car,   there goes Astor's piano lessons.    Take the mini van.  No, I can't.  It's too big of an inconvenience.  You'll drop me at work.  I'll borrow one from the motor pool.  I'll make it up to you.  Dinner? I have a better idea.  Pack a lunch, bring the kids, I'll take you out on the ocean tomorrow.    The kids have school tomorrow.    Think of it as a field trip.  You don't know cody's teacher.    Just one day Just one more day.  Is everything okay, Dexter? After everything we've been through lately, I just want to be together with you guys.  Is that selfish? No, it's lovely.  Sergeant Doakes can rejoice.  I come bearing real food.  Shit.  All right.  Suck my dick, motherfucker.  You understand? Friends of yours? From what I can tell, they're friends of that drug dealer.  They would've killed me once I had all that coke on the boat.  Thanks, Morgan.  Well, this is awkward.  I think we made some alligators very happy.  So, here we are.  Back to fucking square one.  Not exactly.  I'll tell you what, James.    Can I call you James?   Knock yourself out.  I'm toying with an idea I've been under federal investigation for two months.  My trophies were stolen.  Sorry.  The code I live by has been shattered.  And I have a co worker in a cage.  Things aren't going so well.  No shit.  I can see that.  You told me to take responsibility for what I am.  You were right.  Harry killed the wrong person.    Morgan, you're not thinking about   Kill myself? No, that's pathetic.  But I can't live in this house of cards anymore, waiting for it all to fall down.  I need to do something, you know? I'm thinking about turning myself in.  That's a good call, Morgan.  That's a tough call, but that's a good call, man.  I need some fucking relief.  Yeah, you can't keep running, man.  That's for pussies.  You're just gonna end up in exactly the same situation   sooner or later.    Prison.  I could finally get some sleep.  Yeah.  In the long run it would be easier on Deb Better than watching me dragged in like an animal Which, let's face it, will happen someday.  Morgan, we'll do it together.  I'll go with you.  Come on, let's go.  If I do this, I need a day to get my affairs in order.  Fine.  Tie me up, throw me in the trunk.  Let's go.  I brought supplies.  Fresh fruit.  Mention that when they interview you for the story of my life.  Don't leave me in this cage, anything could happen.  What're you doing? I think we've seen the worst of that.  I've really enjoyed our conversations, James.  I lie to everyone I know except my victims right before I kill them.  It's hard to establish much of a rapport there.  Sorry about the cage.  Fuck.    What?   It's me.  What are you doing tonight? I'm about to get off of work, why? I've got some papers I need you to sign.  Papers? What kind of papers? I'll explain when I see you.  I'm meeting Masuka and Batista for drinks.  Why don't you bring the papers and join us?   How's Angel doing?   How do you think he's doing? It's your fault he's in this mess.  If you hadn't fucked Elvira.  I'm not the best brother, am I? Dexter, are you smoking something? I've always been curious to try.  Do you have any weed? Okay, now I'm really worried.  There's no need to worry.  I'll bring by the papers tomorrow.  It's strange.  This should be difficult, but a sense of peace is settling over me.  Calm.  Maybe it's the moonlight.  Tom? Can I meet you outside? Sure.  I'll check in back home.  I need a personal day.  I hope it's a joke.  Just one day.  I think I can prove James is innocent.  I talked to a couple of FBI agents   who were in Haiti   Jesus, Maria.  We're in the middle of a manhunt.  You're down two detectives and now you want time off? No.  We can't spare you right now.  This wasn't a request.  I won't be here tomorrow.  I just wanted you to know that.    Diablo.    What is this shit, Masuka?   Hey, tequila's all the same.    Not when it's made from pumpkins.  We're not in the same pay grade.  If I lose my job over this, bro,   I won't have a pay grade.    It won't happen.    We all know you're innocent.    How am I gonna prove it? I can't explain the roofies, the rough sex.    Rough sex?   It was her idea.  Now it's my word against hers.  I'm screwed.    You have got to fight back.    Dude, Morgan's right.  You got to man up, get tough.  Love's a battlefield.  Or in your case, a restraining order.  I appreciate you guys doing this, but you don't have to stay.  Does it ever floor you guys that we had a killer right under our noses this whole time? I mean, who doesn't see that shit? That didn't come out right.  It's all right.  That stuff doesn't bother me anymore.  Next round's on me.  I was wondering when you'd show up.  We need to talk.  Sounds good to me.  I'm making coffee.  Do you want one? I'm here to ask you respectfully to drop the charges against Angel.  If Angel molested me, as the evidence seems to indicate, then he should face the consequences.  Don't you think? It doesn't matter what I think.  But here's what I know.  After tomorrow, I won't be around anymore, so there's no end game in this for you.  You're going somewhere? It's looking more and more likely.  Where? All that matters is that I'll be out of reach permanently.  Come on! Tell me.  I have a right to know.  You're the one who taught me to accept the things I can't change.  This is one of those things.  I don't understand how men can be so stupid.  Not all men.  Yes, every single one of you.  I mean, how could Dexter and Batista be so easily duped by Lila? I took one look at her, I knew she was a walking nightmare.  That's not stupidity.  It's simply in our DNA.  When a pretty girl smiles and bats her eyelashes, we're unable to resist.  I'm worried about Batista.  This is so fucked.  I won't let him take the fall for this.  What can you do? I was wondering if you might access those great, big FBI files of yours and do a search on Miss Lila Tournay.  You see? Powerless to resist.  Will Adams be pissed off when he sees you used FBI files for this? I certainly hope so.  She has no warrants.  No criminal record.  Nothing with the DMV.  And no social security number.  What about visas or green cards or whatever? Nothing.  No records.  That's impossible.  Everyone has a paper trail.  Everyone real.  That sneaky bitch.  She's using an alias.  That would be my guess.  How do I find out Lila's real name? I think you know the answer to that.  Cut off her head, look for a label.  There's probably an easier way.  You got something smaller? The last time she was in my apartment, she microwaved some popcorn.  There's definitely gonna be prints on this.  All right, got it.  Next time, make her a cup of tea.  This is Marlene from accounting.  Hi, Marlene from accounting.  She's also a notary public.    Good for you.    I met with a lawyer yesterday.  He helped me prepare a living trust that gives you control of all my assets in the event of my death or certain other situations.  God.  Go away.  This is creepy.  My financial planner said a guy my age should have a will.    Just a precaution.    We're all gonna die eventually.  Is this why you were acting so weird last night?   Probably.    Sign here and I'll need to see an ID.  Fine.  Thanks for showing up last night to support Batista.  I am supporting him.  I stopped by Lila's this morning.  And? I talked to her.  I don't think she's gonna be a problem.  Yeah, 'cause she certainly hasn't been one so far.  I'm free tonight, you wanna stop by? We'll have beer, a couple of steaks? I wanna talk to you about something.  Sounds good.  So, what am I getting? I could use a new TV.  Okay.  But that's the one.  Lundy here.  It's lieutenant LaGuerta.  I'm calling you from Haiti.  Lovely this time of year.  I know I'm not your favorite person in the station right now, but I really need your help.  How so? I just met with Leones, the travel agent that Doakes saw.  There's nothing new there.  I had two agents question him for hours.  Yet he never told them about the blood slides.  What does he know about the blood slides? Doakes was looking for a lab to have them analyzed.    Why?   I don't know why.  If he's our killer, he'd keep as trophies.  He wouldn't have them analyzed.  And I also have a list of special ops missions that Leones personally knows Doakes took part in.  Two of them directly conflict with murders we know to have been committed by the Bay Harbor Butcher.  I'm not sure Leones is our most reliable witness.  No, but it's worth looking into, isn't it? Yes.  Yes, it is.  For starters, why don't you brief me on both those missions? Give me all the details.  Come on, Cody.  Up and over.  Okay, Astor.  Up and over.  There we go.  Watch your step.    Look, a pelican!   There's a bunch of them, there.  What's that? Welcome to the GPS 3000 teletracker.  Previous destinations.  For so long my boat has been a tool of my dark trade A graveyard transport.  I'd almost forgotten it could double as a pleasure craft.  The thing is, if you catch a whale, we're probably gonna have to put it back.  If it's a baby, we could put it in the bathtub.  I'm not gonna take a bath with a whale.  Yes, they always use up all the soap.  It's peaceful out here.  Rita, I've never been a very good boyfriend.  I wouldn't say that.  I just need you to know that you and the kids are very important to me.  No matter what happens, I want you to always know that.  Everything's all right.  I just need to take things slow.    I have a gift for you.    You don't need to.  I want you to have this.  It's the pink slip to the mini van.    I told you we're okay.  You don't   Please.  Take it for the kids.  It'll keep them safer than a broken down convertible.  Thank you.  Very generous.  You're welcome.  I know I've been taking things slow with us, but it's not because I don't have feelings for you.  It's more like I have too many feelings, and I just wanna make sure to get it right.  Me too.  That's not exactly taking it slow.  Sorry.  I'll never do that again.  Well, don't say never.  I was looking for you.  The boys looked at Lila's prints.  We hit the jackpot.  Her real name is Lila West.  I ran her prints through the AFIS, which is tied to ICE.  Get this Her visa expired two years ago.    Bad girl.    I can have her deported.  Not as easy as it sounds.  Miami's swamped with criminal immigrants and refugees from 3rd world countries.  They'll take priority over some British girl.  Then I'll deport her myself.  We got him.  Talked to a park service manager in the Everglades who remembers giving Sergeant Doakes directions 5 days ago.  So you have a tip not Doakes.  The park manager said our target was headed into the Everglades We will have the son of a bitch in handcuffs in 24 hours.  I'd like to urge strong caution in apprehending the suspect.  I'm looking into new intel that might come I got your e mail about Leones.  He will say anything for a dollar.  I agree we have to be careful about this, which is why I'd like some time.  Show a little guts, for Christ's sakes.  Why don't you show a little respect? You wouldn't be closing in on a suspect if it wasn't for his work.  You know, as much as I enjoy hearing from the local talent, I'm really rather busy right now.  I guess you don't need me to fight your battles anymore.  Maybe you need me to fight yours.  Aren't you a tough one? I'm just warming up.  I thought I lived in a shit can.  Officer Morgan, have you come to inquire about my welfare? I want you to leave Miami tonight.  Don't ever come back.  Don't ever contact Angel or Dexter again.  And why would I listen to you? Cause I'm a cop.  And you're here on an expired visa.  I know your real name, and I've contacted Immigration.  Officers will be here any day now.  They'll arrest you and deport you, and it won't be pretty.  If this is true, why are you telling me this? Because I want you the fuck out of here now.  Whether you leave on your own or Immigration hauls your sorry ass away I don't give a shit.  But I don't want to give you one more day to fuck with the people I care about.  I want you gone.  Tonight.  You don't want to do this.  It's done.  Tonight.  Welcome.  Previous destination.  Starting route guidance.  Left turn ahead.  I keep expecting to come to my senses, but the pressure is lifting with each step I take.  I've spent a lifetime keeping up my guard, watching my back, wearing my mask.  Relief was never in sight until now.  If anyone deserves to take me into custody, it's Deb.  But how do I tell her what I am? I'm the Bay Harbor Butcher.  Deb, I'm the Bay Harbor Butcher.  Down on the ground, motherfucker.  It's me.  I'm the Bay Harbor Butcher.  I'm him the Butcher.  This isn't going to be easy.  I brought extra beer.  We're getting drunk.  Fine with me.  What's the occasion? I ran Lila out of town today.  Really? Turns out she's here illegally.  You should have seen me, Dex.  I was like an Old West sheriff.  You're really feeling good.  Fuck, yeah.  I got to say, great timing, Dex, getting together tonight.  Lately, I was starting to feel like I had my head pretty far up my ass.  No one blames you.  Your world was turned upside down.  Like mine is now.  For the 1st time since that Ice Truck Killer shit, I feel like I'm back.  New and improved, even.  When all that stuff was happening With rudy, I mean did you ever consider doing something drastic? Are you kidding? All kinds of fucked up shit ran through my head.  Thank God I had you.  Really? Every time I started to spin out of control, I had you to grab onto.  Hell, you let me live here practically forever.  It was tough, though.  I'd have done almost anything to get out from under the weight of it all.  How'd you finally do it? I just saw through it.  You know? You decide who you are, who you want to be and you hold onto that and ride it out.  Like an Old West sheriff.  Brother, this is worth living for.  Right? You are absolutely right.  What did you want to talk to me about? Nothing.  Nothing at all.  So this is me, riding it out.  Harry may have rejected me, but Deb clearly believes in me, so why shouldn't I? I'm not turning myself in.  This isn't Harry's life.  It's mine.  I made a plan to frame Doakes, and I'm going to stick with it.  No shit? I'm on the way.  They found Doakes' fucking rental car.  They found Really? His car? Did they find Doakes? Not yet.  But the search grid's closing in.  We got to get to the station.  Actually I got to make sure they don't find Doakes in a cage.  Hallelujah.  Hey, I'm in here! Who's out there? Anybody out there? Ending route guidance.  Somebody in there? You have arrived at your destination.      Previous EpisodeNext Episode"

You're giving Doakes to the press? He is not your man! Your credibility was compromised when you failed to report a call from the subject of a goddamn FBI manhunt.  Who joined who in the shower earlier? What if I set the alarm 10 min earlier in the future? \"Future\", I like the sound of that.  A woman named Lila Tournay has filled sexual assault charges   against him.    The fucking bitch! I could lose everything over this.  Why can't you just let me go? Because I'm your real soulmate.  Not Rita.  Jesus Christ, you're the Bay Harbor Butcher.  I really hate that name.  What's it gonna be, Morgan? Kill me now or set me free.  Don't worry, I'll send the FBI soon enough.    You're still gonna try to frame me?   Mission accomplished.  One more nail in Doakes' coffin.    We got him.    So you have a tip, not Doakes.  Parc manager said our target was heading into the Everglades.  We will have the son of a bitch in the handcuffs in 24 hours.  Do not ever go to Rita's house again.  Stay away from Rita.

Somebody in there? Hello, who's out there? I need some help! Get me out of here! Who are you? Just open the door! I'm being held captive.  Leave the mess for once.  Walk away from the mess.    I can't do that.    We need you.  Lundy's mobilizing every agency in 5 counties.  We're closing in.  You've a rental car, not Doakes.  God, come on!   I'm only helpful if there's blood.    Maybe we'll shoot him.  You'll need a paramedic, not me.    Are you afraid to face Doakes?   Yes.  Of course I'm afraid to face him.    And I have dishes to do.    OK.  I'll let you know when it's over.  It's Doakes.  You hate the guy.  I used to.  I can't even afford to think of him as a person anymore.  Would you get going? I tried.  If they find Doakes locked inside a cage, it'll seriously undermine my frame job.  I need to beat them to that cabin.  Waiting in the Everglades are hordes of county sheriffs, search parties and ravenous reptiles.  And at this corner wearing dark trunks, the mighty Dexter.  Drive much? I need a miracle.  There's a switch right behind you on the wall.  Damn, it's good to see another face.  I never thought I would.  I'm sergeant James Doakes, Miami Metro Homicide.    Who put you in there?   A fucking psycho.  He could be back any minute.  Grab that key right behind you on the wall.  Who is he? His name is Dexter Morgan.  I need you to open this gate.  Why would he put you in there? Because I find out he's the Bay Harbord Butcher! Please, just open this fucking gate! He's the Butcher? That's I'm trying to tell you.  What's in there? Exactly what you think it is.  It's evidence.  And I saw what happened.  I really need to get out of this cage, lady.  Poor thing, all alone.  I'm okay.  Just open the gate.  Not you.  Hiding such an enormous secret.  What a burden that's got to be.  No wonder he is so shut down.  What are you, his accomplice? I'm his soulmate.  You can't leave me in here like this.  You'll be an accessory.  I'm not gonna leave you.  Not like that.  What the fuck are you doing? What the fuck are you doing? No! Do you understand this is murder? Open this sucking door! This is a fucking murder! Hey.  Dexter Morgan, Miami Metro P. D.  Forensics.  I'm here to join the search for the Bay Harbor Butcher.  The search is on hold right now until they sort out the confusion.    Confusion, huh?   Yeah, it's a real mess.  Take right at the fork.  Park outside the line of fire trucks.  Confusion requires fire trucks? When something beyond reason happens, it turns skeptics into believers.  Believers in a higher power.  But what kind of power did this? You were fucking fast! I just got here   and took a helicopter with Lundy.    I broke a lot of speed limits.  After you left, I realized you were right.  I didn't want to miss the action.  What happened? They think a propane tank exploded.  How? Do I look like a fucking fire chief? Did they find a body? Just bits and pieces so far.  Was it spontaneous combustion? Divine intervention? If you believe that God makes miracle, you have to wonder if Satan has a few up his sleeve.  But when you don't believe in anything, who do you thank at a time like this? We got a floater.  He got left off.  Separation.  Gaping areas of putrefied tissue.  Extensive fourth degree burns.  Big ass fucking explosion.  What else can you give us? These linear lines around his eyes are unburned.  He was squinting.  Alive when it happened.  What else? Teeth are intact.  Dental records should give us a positive ID.  Goddammit, Masuka.  Is it Doakes? Male.  African American.  About the right length of torso.  Heavily muscled.  I think it's him.  These are the same kind of tools that scuba diving class found.  He'd need them to make cuts that clean.  Those come from the suspect? No, they belong to a second body.  And whoever he was, he was dead and dismembered before the explosion.  This is where the Butcher did his dirty work.  It's a perfect location for a kill room.    Doesn't get anymore remote than this.    No, it couldn't.    This is good news, gentlemen.    And lady.  Right.  All right, we keep the search on until we get a firm ID on that body in the water.  You agree? The evidence is compelling.  Overwhelming, actually.  I guess we got our man.  Shit, LaGuerta's here.    I woudn't if I were you.    Is it James? They don't know yet.  Apparently, miracles are subjective.  I can't exactly feel LaGuerta's pain, but I can appreciate it.  Doakes wasn't so bad in the end.  But the truly tragic thing would be to let his sacrifice go to waste.  There's only one way I can think of to honor him.  I have to embrace my freedom.  Sleep.  What a concept.  I can't believe I actually contemplated turning myself in.  This is so much better than a prison cell.  I can squeeze fresh orange juice.  Savour a fine French roast.  Grab a morning work out.  OK, working out, I could have done in prison, but still.  I'm free.  Sorry.    Hope I didn't scare you.    What are you doing out there? I figured the kids were still sleeping, I didn't want to ring the bell.  Why are you here? I figured the kids were still asleep I like when you sneak unexpected.  Yeah, I wound up with some unexpected time on my hands.  Like twenty years to life.  I don't know if this is a good idea.  I was just getting used to you from a distance.  I don't know, you've been like a mirage.  I've been right here.  You're the one that run away.  Yeah, I did.  I kinda forgot who I was.  I got it straight now.  Keep it straight.  Or I won't be here next time.  I know that.  Mom? It's the sex police.    How come you're still in bed?   I overslept.  Will you make us pancakes, please? What's under here? Are you guys back together? I guess we are.  Over.  Under.  Over.  Under.    Maybe I should do it myself.    No, I wanna do it.    We're gonna be late.    So what? Case is closing.  We still need confirmation on Doakes's body.  And if it's him?   Then, it's over.    The case, not us, right? We still have the wrap up to do: cataloguing, confirming,   filing, more filing   So we've got time? Plenty.    Time enough for a vacation?   Now you're talking.  Toes in the sand, tequila.  Little tiny bikini.  How about a parka?   A what?   I've had my feel of heat.  No more heat.  You'd look great in a parka.  Ever heard of Lake Ipperwash?   Can't say that I have.    Wonderful ice fishing.  Very romantic.  Fine.  OK.  Let's just go.    Morning, Dex.    Donut? I'm not really feeling like donuts today.  Know what I mean? Oh, right.  Donuts.    Hey, are you free?   Vince, you have no idea.  Good.  I got a dozen boxes of burned up shit from the cabin that need cataloguing.  I was looking more closely at the date of James' Special Forces missions,   and   We have a positive ID on the body.  There may be an additional date which puts him out of the country The burned victim is Sgt Doakes.  Dental records confirmed it.  And the other body? Jose Garza, a murder fugitive who's been living under the alias Chris Harlow.  The body was dismembered.  Consistant with our other victims.  Deputy director Adams is closing the case.  I see.  All the evidence points to James Doakes as the Bay Harbor Butcher.  Conclusively.    I wanted you to hear it from me 1st.    Thank you.  I am truly sorry.  Don't know why they keep hauling crap from the cabin in here.  We already know what we need to know.    Doakes was a suicidal maniac.    The term is homicidal maniac.  Not that I'm judging.  Whatever.  He blew himself up.  That's what I'm saying.  I heard somebody saying it was a propane accident.  Right.  Doakes accidentally turned on the propane valve, and then the stove.  The stove was on? It was in the official fire investigators' report this morning.  I mean I guess it could be that Doakes didn't realize fire and gas are a bad combo.  But my money's on suicide.  A bad ass like Doakes would rather burn than get burned.  It's a good line for my movie.    I better write it down.    You're writing a movie about Doakes? Maybe or not.  He'd rather burn than get burned I checked and didn't see any GPS device in the minivan, Dexter.  Did you check the glove box? It's grey, rectangular, the size of a paperback book.  It wasn't there.  I even looked under the seats.  You think it was stolen? Maybe.  Thanks, Rita.  I'll see you tonight.  If someone stole my GPS, it would've lead 'em straight to Doakes.  Who do I know with a nasty habit of stealing? My miracle worker.  It looks peaceful in there.  Doesn't it? I'm glad you called.  I was afraid maybe you'd left town.    Seems I found a good reason to stay.    Like what? A new victim? You mean you? That's why you asked me to the aquarium? A public place.  You thought I was gonna That I would slit my needle into your neck? Is that how you do it? It's one of the ways.  You're afraid of me now, aren't you? Always been afraid of you, Dexter.  Why? From the 1st time I saw you, I could see how hopelessly consumed you were by your need.  You lied to me.  All that time as my sponsor.  You said all you wanted was to help me control my addiction.    Would you control it?   That's not what you really wanted.  Was it? What do you think I wanted? To know what it's like to feel something that deeply.  Anything.  That's why you hang up in recovery groups.  You're emotionally color blind.  You use the right words, you pantomime the right behavior, but feelings never come to pass.    It's not true.    It is, Lila.  You know the dictionary definition of emotions, Longing, joy, sorrow You have no idea of what any of those things actually feel like.  You're wrong, I have feelings for you.  You wanna have feelings for me,   they're just impulses.    Enough.  They're primitive responses to immediat needs You know all the words but you can't hear the music.  Don't do this here.  I'm just like you.  I was down to my last hope.  So was I.  When he told me who you are, I thought that was a secret worth protecting.  Most stuff in my mind.  I wish you could have seen it.  The explosion was brilliant.  I'm more like my father than I've ever imagined.  I created a monster of my own.  Told you.  We're meant to be together.  Lila, I'm sorry I pushed you away.  I know how frightening it must have been for you.  Me scratching to get in.  But it's okay.  I'm in now.  And I'm not going anywhere.  I am.  And with Doakes gone, I'm starting to think it's too dangerous for me here.  I need to move on, to disappear,   I've already said my goodbyes.    Let me come with you.  I was hoping you'd say that.  How long would it take you to get ready? To close my accounts Shut up my business Tomorrow afternoon.  Go home and pack.  I'll call you tomorrow.  I can't wait to go away with you.  I can't wait.  You're going away with me all right.  In a garbage bag.  But it went all right? Sure, for an internal affairs investigation.  I spent 2 hours saying \"No!\" \"I did not rape Lila Tournay.  \"She's bad shit, nuts, wacko\".  I started to run out of adjectives.  I've got a few you can use.  The good news is the department is dying to drop the charge.  They're dodging enough bullets with this whole Doakes thing.  Good.  When they find out your so called victim fled Miami, you'll be reinstated.    Lila went away?   She fucking better.  Last night, I told her to haul her ass out of town before she's deported.    You did that for me?   Of course.  For you and for Dex.  You 2 window lickers needed somebody to snap you out of it.  It's good to know somebody's pulling for you when you're down.  Okay, I get the point.    Are you sure Lila got the message?   Yeah, totally.  I made it pretty clear.  Excuse me.  Donations can be made directly to me.    Donations?   For sergeant Doakes' memorial service.  You got to be kidding.  That's what we do for a fellow officer.    Thanks again, Morgan.    Yeah.  Excuse me, lieutenant.  I   was wondering   Checks payable to cash.  Actually, I wanted to offer my support.  Some sympathy or whatever.  If you wanna talk Thank you, Morgan.  I can manage.  I'm not so sure You're collecting money to honor a killer.  I'm not honoring the Butcher.  I'm honoring James Doakes.  Respectfully, Maria, that's denial.    So it is.    You're choosing to be in denial? Conscious denial.  But the case is closed.  I won't pursue it.  But I knew James.  I knew him.  As a partner and as a friend.  And I have to keep on believing that is who he was, because If he could hide all that over fucked up shit,   then I don't think I could ever   Trust anyone again.  That's right.  Or yourself? I'll leave a check in your office.  It's strange to have a creation out there.  A deeply mutated version of yourself, running loose and screwing everything up.  I wonder if this is how parents feel.  What the fuck?   What're you doing here?   I came to make sure Lila left town.  Me too.  And if she was still here you're gonna what? Wrestle her? Jesus! What have we here? The door was open.  I just stepped out to buy some snacks for the road trip.  Come to say goodbye.  We came to see that you cleared out.  Now we see you're on your way, we're good to go.  Have a nice fucking life.    You're not coming with me, then.    My God! What did you do to make her so pathetically crazy for you? Does your dick dance? I better be on my way, then.  I think that's my bag.  I left it last time I was here.  I'm pretty sure it's mine.  I can open it up, so you can check for yourself.  No, it's my mistake.    Goodbye, then.    Have a nice flight.  Don't forget your broom.  Hello, this is Lila.  Leave your name and number.  I'll ring you back asap.  Lila, where are you? I'm ready to hit the road.  Hope you're not mad about that thing with Deb.  Had to lie.  I don't want her to know we're running off together.  Call me right away.  I miss you.  Bedroom! What're we doing home in the middle of the day? She asked, hoping for sex.  You're packing already! Good thing I got my touque.    Lake Ipperwash or bust.    Slow down.  Wait! I got a parka.  Do you know how hard it is to find a parka in Miami? When do we leave? Not \"we\".  Me.  I just got a call from D. C.  A pattern of bodies was identified in Oregon.  My flight leaves tonight, at 7:00.  You gotta be fucking kidding me.  I wish I were.  But it's too soon.  I mean If you're leaving, we gotta work out logistics.  Logistics? Yeah.  We got a lot a shit to figure out.  Weekend visits and red eye flights and frequent flyer plans.  Let me get my calendar.  Do you honestly want to go down this path? You're right.  I don't.  Long distance relationships never work out.  Not even in the movies.  Fuck it! What're you doing? Logistics.  Taking in a leave of absence.  You're not thinking this through.  What's to think about? I'm going with you.  It's just a job.  It's more than that to you.  Okay, I love my job.  But not as much as I love being kin with you.  Just do me a favor.  Take the afternoon and think about this.  Fine.  You do me a favor and buy me a goddam ticket on your flight.  I'm going home to pack and I'll see you at the airport.  That was delicious.  What did you like better, the nature stew or the mud pudding? I want worms on toast.  Can we have worms on toast for a snack? Go wash up asap.  No running in the house, please! Yeah, real mature! Captain, you called for me? Hey, Dexter.  I received a phone call from a woman saying she's a friend of yours.    Who?   She wouldn't give her name, but claims to have vital information on the Butcher.    Any idea who she might be?   English accent?   That's her.    I think she might have a personal issue with me.  It's the same woman that tried to railroad Batista.  Avoid her.  Not a chance.  Now this case is closing, I can't afford any loose ends.    She said she was coming in?   Within the hour.    And she mentionned my name?   Specifically.  Stick around.  We'll sort this thing out together.  If Lila plans to turn me in, why drop my name to the captain and give me a chance to intercept her? It doesn't make sense.  Unless she wants me here so she can hurt me some other way.  Guys? Lexi.    Where're the kids?   I can't remember.  I got your message.  What's going on?   The kids are missing.    Sorry, I didn't mean to fall asleep.  We have to call the police.  Call Deb.  She'll have the entire force looking for them.  See if any neighbor saw anything.  I'll drive around the area.  I promise we'll find them.  We're going to terminal 7, Miami International.    Morgan.    It's Rita.    I'm getting in a cab.    Cody and Astor are missing.    You called the police?   Dex said to call you.  Sit by the phone, I'll take it from here.  All right.    Could you wait?   You don't wanna go to the airport? Of course I do.  I just said \"wait\".  For Christ sake, make up you mind.  Why? Why do I have to make up my mind? Goddammit! Here.  Hi, Dexter.    Hi, Dexter.    Hey, Dex.    Hey, guys.  Having fun?   Super fun.  Lila's so nice.    Where is Lila?   I'm over here.  Could've had it all, Dexter.  Stay on the bed.  Don't move! Look away, both of you.  Astor, you first.  You're gonna help your brother.  Go! Run! Find help!   Come on!   I can't fit.  Shit.  What do you remember from before? Before we took you in.  Nothing.  Good.  Because what happened was too strong.  Son, it got into you too early.  And it's gonna stay there.  It's gonna make you wanna kill.  And you won't be able to stop it.  So I'm gonna be like this forever.  You gonna be okay.  I got you.  I'm so sorry about all of this.  It's over now.  They're safe.  You're safe.  It's all that matters.  You two.  Secure a perimeter and have the fire chief come to see me.  Put out an APB on Lila West, aka Lila Tournay, suspected arsonist.  pale like a fucking corpse.  Fucking corpse, got it.  You're wasting your time.  She's not coming back.  Not after this.    Yeah, I wouldn't bet on it.    She won't.  She's a survivalist.  How'd you know the kids were here? A neighbor saw them walking with a strange woman.  Wasn't much of a leap.  Lila's gone after everyone that's close to you.  What? Pretty impressive.  Not too long ago, I was taking care of you.    I like it better this way.    I can see that.  Why's this man not on the way to the hospital? I'm fine.  No, your eyebrows are singed.  How can you be so relaxed? I'm good at compartmentalization.  You're a little weird, Dex.  That's not gonna change.  I'm gonna be this way forever.  I can live with that.  Just smarten up, OK? I passed through the flames and rose from the ashes.  Again.  I've never put much weight onto the idea of a higher power.  But if I didn't know better, I'd have to believe that some force out there wants me to keep doing what I'm doing.  You wanted to be close to me.  This is the most I have to offer.  I cannot feel my My legs and my body.  Good.  I chose a spinal epidural instead of a tranquilizer.  I've got a plane to catch.  And you don't need to feel this.  You killed an innocent man.  I did it for you.  You tried to kill the kids for me, too? Don't do this.  You told me to accept what I am.  And to trust in the one thing I know with absolute clarity.  Thank you.  Not long ago I had a dream that people could see me for what I am.  For a brief instant in time, the world actually saw my bodies of work.  Some even cheered.  But as it turns out, nobody mourns the wicked.  Sorry, James.  I think Harry knew that from the start.  That's why he gave me a code.  It cost him his life, but it kept me alive through incredible trials.  The code is mine now, and mine alone.  So too are the relationships I cultivate.  They're not just disguises anymore.  I need them.  Even if they make me vulnerable.  My father might not approve, but I'm no longer his disciple.  I'm a master now.  An idea transcended into life.  And so this is my new path.  Which is a lot like the old one.  Only mine.  To stay on that path, I need to work harder.  Explore new rituals, evolve.  Am I evil? Am I good? I'm done asking those questions.  I don't have the answers.  Does anyone?       Previous EpisodeNext Episode"

Cause he just made the cover of Florida Magazine Top prosecutor in the state two years in a row He and Laguerta go way back you know that whole Cubano thing Yeah the guy is Ramon Prado Miguels middle brother He's a lieutenant with the sheriffs department Made himself quite the reputation for being a law and order hard ass and Oscar.

That part of the neighbourhood isn't exactly policefriendly but i'm staying on it Talk to me about forensics Evidence indicates this was no hit and run It was a furious close end battle Whoever. .  Was it whomever? Whoever's good Whoever did this got in a lucky shot or was realy good at handling a blade According to the ME the aorta was cleanly severed in one penetration Not easy to do Any luck finding the weapon? It's not on either premises We've checked roofs, sewers, trashbins in a five blocks radius Our conclusion the assailant took it with him.  Dexter what's the blood saying? Pretty much what everyone else is I have some second level on scene work to do I get back to you ASAP Give it to sergeant Baptista Full disclosure I've had a personal relationship with the Prado family for many years and it goes alot further than the whole Cubano thing Sergeant Stating the obvious lieutenant I'd like Freebo for this Me too Morgan.  Yes mam Hit the streets harder Learn what you can learn With all due respect lieutenant if Freebo did this he's not in Miami I mean he's in the winds We could sit around on our asses and speculate on wherever we think the prime suspect may or may not be or we can actualy go and look for him As a Miami prosecutor I have dedicated my career to fighting crime To make our streets safe for everyone Every family white, black, latino, asian deserves the full measures of our devotion to their dignity another crime has touched my family in the most profound way imaginable I grieve equaly for every family that has been visited with the same unimaginable news that we have received today Our beautiful city is a city of families and the untimely taking of any of us touches all of us My parents brought my brothers from.  Part of my ritual has always been to get to know my victims Confirming their guilt beyond all doubt.  Oscar Prado tried to kill Freebo and he tried to kill me No way he was there on some noble youth club mission He's got to be guilty of something Aren't we all? So I ask again Who are you? Two speeding tickets and an illegal u turn What about outside the code of Harry Harry finds me in a pool of blood Turns me into his own personal vendeta machine and when he see's the monster he created in action he kills himself Death can drink to his honor on his own Any luck in the land of reluctant witnesses One house I play good cop the next i play bad cop I still can't get shit from anybody in that neighbourhood You know what the problem is right? Wait Quinn let me guess The cop part? No they don't owe you anything There's no insentive which gives the balance of power weighing in their direction, right Her let me give you one thing, call this guy, tell him you know me.  Tell him you want to cash in one of my coupons.  Coupons ? Yeah he's a CI from my days in narcotics.  He got a hook in him and it's not coming out aanytime soon.  What you want in return? For you to remember that i did you a solid Not even a thank you? Thank you Stop looking at my ass Detective.  Officer.  Your Anton? In the flesh You got something you want to show me? Oh yeah I've seen him before Realy? Where? In the news Isn't that the guy you let walk with those co ed killers.  Now that there was some fine piece of police work You know him from the news paper Yeah i think i saw him on CNN or something Ok that's all you got? Thats all you got You know if you and Quinn's fucking with me Im realy not in the mood You know summer if you need something for that temper I got a man down the street that sells realy ?mellow weak? to take that edge right off.  Well thank you but i don't take advice from drugdealers so. .  Drugdealers?! Oh never that.  Drug user, occationaly Strictly weed though officer, strictly weed Then how did you become Quinns snitch I got caught up in a drugbust Quinn told me if I blew the whistle on the bigger fish I would stay out of jail so i listened attentively Yeah well you know it never hurts for an occational drug user to have another friend on the force That's the thing officer I got enough friends Yeah well im out of here Yeah you have a good one you hear What about this Prado guy? . . and to determine the impact site.  The exact point where forces carry the body You have to distinguish the geometric differences between backspatter, satelite spatter, misting and arterial spurting   Groose!   Shut up! Ehm, you remember how before when Caties dad was talking about being a surgent Yeah and sometimes how he has to cut into bodies and there's blood But he saves lives Do you save lives? Ok you know how there's good guys and there's bad guys? So you catch bad guys? Well not directly but I help Do you have a uniform? Eh, lab coat A gun? No He got a badge.  A laminate Well thank you so much for taking time from your busy schedule Mr. Morgan to come and talk to the children Yeah it was a real learning experience Looks like I realy got through to em huh It would have sucked even worse today if I didn't have a dad today Thanks for inviting me buddy If anyone should have father issues, anger, rejection, abandonment it's Cody and what does he do? He moves on.  How does that happen? I was so bad you're crying? No, no it's just something I always wanted You being here for the kids It felt so wonderfully uncomplicated Hello? Mr. Morgan this is Miguel Prado I need to see you Right away So much for uncomplicated It almost looks like a piece of art Thank you sir but to me it's more like a story Tell me that story Mr. Morgan The encounter started over here The scuff marks on the linoleum, the crumpling, the thrower up, they all have the directional followty that leads to. .  Now this is where your brother and Freebo he's my lieutenants prime suspect But you know that There was a brutal struggle I got to say it looks like your brother fought like a hero but he was overmatched and sustained a fatal stabwound to the chest Everything about the blood suggests that your brother bleed out almost instantly.  Did he suffer? Blood never lies So now i know how he died Question is why Well one more thing Mr. Morgan Why would a blood spatter analyst spend time searching the sheriff departments database for information on my dead brother Uhm Like you sir I wanted to understand what happened here I felt that knowing some details about your brothers life help me make sense out of his death In your line of work Mr. Morgan is it usual for you to get so involved? I just sounded like a prosecutor there, i'm sorry It's not a problem sir and no it's not usual for me to get so involved but this one, this death got to me It's just. .  it seem so unreal. .  he's gone Yeah I know So a man died Mr. Morgan and what's left a soul? And what is that exactly? I realy couldn't tell you Because some people say the soul lives on forever I don't know Which makes you a synic It makes me a scientist So noone you ever loved has died? My father died when I was in my twenties and you don't believe that his soul, call it his lifeforce is still here somehow living inside you? Because I I should have been there for him You can't blame yourself sir.  It's easier said than done Mr. Morgan Do me a favour You realy want to get to know my brother like you say Come to his wake tonight Come see how much and how, how fully he was loved.  Ok Taken enough of your day here, thank you. .  Dexter This reports final? Blood specimen's I collected all came back belonging to Oscar Prado Trace prints on and around the victim all points to Freebo Anyone out there talking? Officer Morgan was hitting up the usual firewall of clammed up witnesses and eyewitnesses so I put her in touch with an old CI of mine hopefully she Hey Quinn that CI you put me on was totaly useless for Freebo Sadly it's not a perfect world Yeah for all we know Freebo is in like Nebraska by now Well I guess you don't owe me that favour then How come he gets favours? He doesn't But what the CI told me about the victims He wasn't some hero coach that went into the hood and took one for the team What do you mean? Oscar Prado was into Freebo for some serious cash Now why would someone be into i don't know a drugdealer for big bucks.  Because Oscar Prado the pride of little Havannah was a fucking junkie.  Thanks Maria Good one Morgan She's been in better moods Yeah I didn't exactly brighten her day No you didn't Excuse me for doing my fucking job! You see any other supercops coming down here with any leads? No Deb you're definitly amazing but you gotta I know i know i know Be aware of my surroundings take the temperature of the room before I open my mouth I know it's a bad habit I admit it Well look on the bright side now that you've given up men, boose and cigarettes running your mouth is the only bad habbit you have left That's right I'm a model of fucking perfection You know what day it is today right? How could I forget? You wanted to see me? Hey Baptista I need you to think about Debbie Morgans continued involvement on the Oscar Prado case You want me to throw her under the bus for what being a little overzealous It's not about heal It's about tact and sensitivities It's also about the real world This case is as high profile as it gets.  I No Morgan is resourceful, intanatious and usualy the right amount of pain in the ass But there's political ramifications and my history with Miguel Prado aside this case is just too big for her Just say the word Maria and I will follow your orders Becoming a homicide sergeant is more than just a bump in payscale it's a quantum leap in responsibility All part of moving up the chain If i'll bounce her she'll hate me Your her boss ? not her friend It's up to you Can I get another cranberry juice That makes three problems down under Geez I like the fucking taste ok Miss you dad My condolences Thank you for coming Losing my brother it's gonna leave a pain in my heart that I don't think ever gonna heal You have a brother Dexter? No just a one loud sister What she said back at the station It's ok I know my brother was a good man but i can tell that he suffered from the tragedy of perfection Who doesn't Oh indeed You attacked me with a knife in a dopedealers house.  No Oscar you certainly didn't suffer from the tragedy of perfection Then why do this feel so wrong? Why in your death are you still so alive in my life Did you know him well? Not as well as I thought Sorry Cuervo black Thanks Harry What the hell is that? Cranberry Juice is that gonna be a problem? Not even close to a problem but the taste is kinda funky You know by the time my dad was my age he already had his shield Kinda why i'm here I'm taking you off the Oscar Prado case I come up with grade a intel on Oscar Prado and I get tossed of the case for being a little loud? In a nutshell Did Maria put you up to this?

Fred bowman,a. k. a.  freebo, Kills two college girls And escapes on a state police screw up.  Looking to hold some product.  I need a hit.  Did you hear what I said? Fuck off,teegan.  Fine,I guess your dick can suck itself from now on! Freebo,get back here! Who are you? Who are you? I got it,dex.  got what? Only the case that's gonna get me my shield.  It's huge.  angel put me on it.  Who he is Is what makes this case huge.  It's miguel prado, Assistant district attorney.  He and laguerta go way back.  The other guy's ramon prado, Miguel's middle brother.  He's a lieutenant with the sheriff's department.  And Oscar.  Prado? As in baby brother.  I've never killed anyone I didn't completely vet before, Whose guilt I wasn't absolutely certain of.  Oscar prado tried to kill freebo.  Then he tried to kill me.  He's gotta be guilty of something.  Why would a blood spatter analyst Spend time searching for information On my dead brother? This one,this death got to me.  Morgan,right? do I know you? Yuki amado,internal affairs.  And? You know joey quinn? I'm gonna do you a favor.  Call this guy, Tell him you wanna cash in one of my coupons.  He's an informant from my days in narcotics.  You're anton? You got something you need to show me? What about this prado guy? Oh,yeah,I've seen him before.  Oscar prado was into freebo for some serious cash.  You getting along with the new boss man? Ah,fuck him.  He took me off the oscar prado case And put me on this.  Some dead end jane doe.  Teegan.  freebo's girlfriend.  Looks like he's still in miami.  We're supposed to see hope in children.  But right now,all I see are little bundles of uncertainty.  And germs.  But that's another matter.  I love kids.  I can play with them,enjoy them And leave.  I don't have to worry about what they'll become.  A nobel prize laureate.  A drunk.  President of the united states.  Or someone like me.  Why do parents take the chance? I've never felt compelled.  But why would i? I'm not in the business of giving life.  It's for sure.  I'm pregnant,heh.  What should we do? I don't know.  We should talk.  Weigh all the options.  Together.  I have to get to work.  Weighing options.  the pros and cons.  Something I'm good at,usually.  What the fuck,dex? I was yelling at you to hold the elevator,ass wipe.  Sorry,I'm feeling off.  So see a doctor.  Saw one.  Really didn't help.  The oscar prado case? Yeah,fuckers are on the career maker of the year.  They nail this freebo guy and they're golden.  The courts already let freebo go once For those two girls in the everglades.  That was then.  This time,he killed a senior a. d. a. 's brother.  Afternoon fix.  Except he didn't kill oscar.  I did.  If it hadn't been for freebo, Oscar would still be alive, And I wouldn't be in this mess.  Besides,he's seen my face.  I've gotta find freebo before they do.  That's one thing I'm sure of,at least.  Nice watch.  Knockoff? Me? no.  real thing only.  I sold a kidney to get it.  I'll show you the scar sometime.  I'll give you a kidney not to.  Hey,dex,do me a favor.  Go over the prado blood evidence One more time,okay? Maybe you missed something.  Okay,but   sergeant! Yeah? we got narcotics on the line.  All right.  Hey,dex,wait up.  My jane doe.  See what you see.  Already saw what I saw,which was nothing.  So see what you see again.  I can't afford none solved, Coroner says he found a pharmacy in her.  Big surprise,right? Body dumped near the waterfront stroll.  Shocker.  Looks like every other tweaker hooker case.  Except the tattoo peeled off her shoulder.  Coroner says not a tattoo.  You're getting interested.  Actually,I'm getting sleepy.  It's reassuring to know I'm not the only one at sea.  I could throw them a line, Tell them their cases are linked.  That jane doe is actually freebo's girlfriend.  That it was freebo who killed her.  But I need the head start.  Step away from the incense.  This is america,buddy.  Freedom of religion.  I didn't realize you were a buddhist,vince.  Japanese are traditionally shinto.  Really? oh,whatever.  I bought all this shit off my manicurist.  Need all the luck I can get.  Got a crucifix up there too.  'cause it did so much for jesus? 'cause forensics quarterly Is deciding whether or not to publish my article.  You know,the one you read.  And proofed.  The incense stays.  Did he use you at the doctor's office? But you've got to use me,maria.  A. d. a. s can put pressure on other agencies.  We have ramon,who's with the sheriff's department.  Together,we   Miguel,miguel,tranquillo.  I know that you and ramon are going to help.  And it's hard to let somebody else Handle oscar's case.  But I have my best detectives on this.  I got the best forensics team   Morgan,right? he's part of it.  We are tracking down Every one of freebo's known associates   Looking under every rock.  We will find him.  This is a good team.  This is the same team,by the way, That shared a roof with the bay harbor butcher.  That was totally out of line.  I'm  i'm sorry,maria.  It's just that my   my fuse is so short Ever since oscar.  Even with syl.  I'm driving her nuts.  I doubt that.  She knows what she's got.  The bay harbor butcher situation   No,don't   no,please.  I was too personally involved To see it clearly.  And that's why I've distanced myself from things.  You should do the same with oscar.  I know.  I know.  you're right.  Some things never change.  We're not as close as we used to be.  But at least I still have you as a colleague.  And I'm glad that it's you that's here.  Gracias.  Miguel prado's already seen too much of me.  I can't comfort the grieving.  You got this? I got this.  Don't look familiar,hon.  Ooh,but those are some fine streaks.  Who did her hair? Christophe of beverly fuckin' hills.  Yeah,do you have his number? Petunia, You are the dumbest whore on this stroll.  Sorry,sugar.  Don't got a name for you.  Keep walkin',girl.  It's all you're good for.  S'up,deb? The she males give you any leads? It's officer morgan to you.  Right,not a detective yet.  Course,an unsolved isn't gonna get you any closer To a shield.  Look,I don't know why i. a.  picked me,but   'cause detective quinn likes the ladies.  Well,then you don't need a snitch.  You need a fuckin' slut.  So why don't you go talk to petunia over there? I can get you a shield tomorrow.  I'm a sergeant,after all.  You'd give me a shield for being a rat? No,for being an honest cop,debra.  Like your father.  You are not god damn digging into my father right now.  Digging? please.  The old timers at i. a.  talk about him Like he's a brother.  Well,the old timers also talk about How popular that made him.  Oh,god.  That really matters to you,doesn't it? Your cop friends.  It's your whole life.  Them,the job,the shield.  Far as I can tell,without that, You've got nothing.  Except your,uh,treadmill.  Kind of cunt,aren't you? Nice.  But seriously,um,you should look into Expanding your world a little.  You know,finding something else fulfilling.  Likegardening or,um Ooh,scrapbooking.  Just in case.  Get me a name.  Teegan.  Drove a volkswagen rabbit.  That should buy me an address for her.  If I'm lucky,she left me a lead to freebo.  Teegun.  How many parents would give their kid a name like that? Florida.  Nope.  nope.  Bingo.  Teegan campbell.  Address on sorority row.  Guess I know what I'm doing tonight.  Teegan.  No,not a name I'd choose.  Megan.  mary.  Those are classics.  Or,for a boy,charles Or philip.  Or richard.  Or what's so bad about Dexter,jr. ? Reminds me of you,dex.  Harry.  The last person I'd turn to for advice on fatherhood.  Old habits die hard.  Gotta focus on something easier to kill.  Freebo.  Dexter! Shit.

It's cool.  show me the picture.  Not from the neighborhood.  But from the looks of her, I doubt she had to pay cash for her habit.  A strawberry? right.  So I'm looking for a dealer who'll take payment in sex.  Yeah.  that'll be about all of 'em.  Yeah.  Look,I can ask around for you,okay? Thank you.  I'd appreciate it.  But you should stay.  Grab a drink And work some of that massive tension out On the dance floor.  Well,you know what? it smells like armpits in here.  And I got a lot of work to do.  Well,you know,there is more to life than policing.  So I've heard! If we had a house this big, It would make sense to have another child.  It's a valuable lot.  Look at the lawn.  it's so thick.  Be a great place for kids to play.  Zenith zoysia.  Thrives in warm weather.  I'm not talking about grass,dexter.  You're not? I've been trying to talk about the pregnancy The whole way here.  Maybe you should be a little less subtle in the future.  I'm trying not to pressure you.  But we have to make a decision Before one's made for us.  You're right,I know.  okay.  Welcome.  I'm so glad you came.  Made it.  Hello.  I'm rita.  Miguel.  bienvenidos.  So you've met sylvia? Syl,please.  So you guys have a beautiful home here.  Great place for kids.

Wish there were a test.  Oscar,he got the   The best and the worst of dad.  Me,I just tried to stay clear,you know? But,um I suppose he's in me too.  Hard to avoid.  Welcome.  I  i shouldn't drink.  What,are you pregnant? You are.  Oh,my god,that's terrific.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Or not.  That sounded really bad.  I meant Miguel and I have actually been trying for a while now.  It even took once.  And miguel,he Wants to start a family before he makes his run For the d. a. 's office.  But I don't know.  I'm happy with the way things are.  I don't wanna force dexter into something.  That's kind of what happened with the ex husband.  Well,that and the fact that he was a sociopath.  I had an ulterior motive for inviting you here tonight.  Does it involve charging me with a felony? No,the truth is,uh, I wanted to talk to someone Inside of this investigation.  See,'cause all I keep getting is reassurances,reassurances.  Reassurances make me nervous.  You want me to put you at unease? I want you to be straight with me.  How certain are you That this bastard freebo will be found? Very.  So I'm gonna get my shot at him in court? Well,that could take a while.  Huh? no,no,no.  no more waiting.  I'm done waiting.  Is there another option? I'm an a. d. a.  My brother ramon is a sheriff.  You don't think we got resources If our lead pans out, Then we'll talk to homicide.  You have a lead? that's great.  How can I help? No,ramon,you know, He has his own way of doing things.  I don't wanna drag you into it.  Come on.  You're talking to the guy You caught breaking into your brother's secure files.  All right.  Ramonmay have Borrowed a cell phone That belonged to freebo's mother.  He calls mommy we can track him.  Mother's cell phone.  that's good thinking.  It may lead to nothing.  Or it may lead them to freebo Before I can get to him.  I need to check out teegan's place As soon as I can get out of here.  The hunt.  My vision is much sharper Through the eyes of my shadow self.

Who the fuck is Chicky Hines? Chicky hines just went down for a carjacking homicide.  He's waiting on sentencing now.  Yeah,this guy Zack says Hines didn't do the crime.  He's offering up an alibi for Hines And another suspect.  I know all about the Chicky Hines case.  He was a big one for the prosecutor, And guess who that was.  Shit.  Yeah, Miguel Prado.  So now,not only won't I be bringing him good news About his brother's case.  Worse  i'm gonna undermine his latest conviction.  Think that's what he wants to hear right now? Doubtful.  Christ,vet this.  oh,yeah,vet this.  Completely.  I wanna be absolutely certain that this is solid Before I even think about bringing it to miguel.  Hey,angel.  Case going all right? No leads,no insights? Just the pressure,bro.  Expected to make decisions,take responsibility.  You don't know what it's like.  Probably like finding out your girlfriend's pregnant.  Rita's pregnant? Looks like it.  Holy shit.  That's fantastic.  It is? My little girl is the best thing I ever did.  I've messed up a lot.  But in my darkest hours, Auri's my light.  You wait and see.  Okay.  Thank you.  I feel better.  A light.  Is that even possible? Higher,daddy! Dexter,come play with us! Come play with us,daddy.  I'm right behind you,buddy.  You're it,baby.  Cody and Astor would be older,you know.  I like them this age.  I always wanted to be a grandfather.  I think we're better off without you.  Well,it's a beautiful family you got there,Dex.  You couldn't picture this,could you? I could have surprised you.  Yeah,there's no reason it couldn't turn out like this.  Astor! Astor! Astor! What have you done?! Yo,Morgan.  Where the hell have you been? Street wasn't clear,yo.  I get spotted with you,no more trusty c. i.  Fine.  what have you got? All right,department six.  Pimp named Javier,completely new to the game.  But he already has a rep for his stable of white girls.  If your jane doe is a strawberry, Chances are he tried to recruit her.  This is good.  Thank you.  Yeah.  You get spotted with me,no more trusty c. i.  Yeah,but he likes 'em white.  Does he like 'em strapped? All right,it's cool.  But I'll be here,anything goes sideways.  Miami metro.  I'm looking for javier.  Entra,por favor.  You're a little young to be in business for yourself.  I'm a wonder kid.  Okay.  Can you identify this woman? You'd make a shitload more money on all fours Than you do as a cop,mamita.  Oh,like I haven't heard that before.  Hey,look,little one,give me a name for this girl, I won't bust you for being a piece of shit.  Never seen her.  hmm.  Besides,she looks too used up to be an earner.  But you,damn,mami.  I could get you a thou a night.  Give you some spending money For,uh,extra curricular activities.  Think I need to hear that? You sleazy piece of shit! I'm a cop! that's all I need! I'm not gonna do any fucking scrapbooking!  You got it?!   Scrapbooking? You fucked her.  You've seen her? On his dick.  Hey,she's fading.  She doesn't even know what she's talking about.  Oh,I think she does, And I think you fucked a girl who's now dead.  Fuck.  Look,I picked her up at some party.  All right? I i i thought that I could turn her out.  What's her name? I don't know! Bitch,cunt,\"hey,you. \" Yeah? This doesn't look good,javier.  All right,look,I passed her to a friend  Who could feed her habit better than I could.  a friend,right.  Yeah! yeah.  Yeah,a white guy named Freebo.  Freebo? Yeah,yeah.  He could deal with her shit longer than I could.  Maybe he's a patient guy.  I don't know.  Yeah,maybe not.  If my first stab at Freebo had gone as planned, Oscar Prado might still be alive, Miguel wouldn't know who I was, Teegan would have lived to whole another day, And Deb wouldn't be chasing a jane doe.  And I wouldn't be watching the clock, Counting the minutes till darkness comes, Trying to get the jump on my friends in blue.  Anything? Uh,running additional DNA tests On Oscar Prado's clothing.  If Freebo's cut himself, His blood could be on these clothes.  Slam dunk in court.  Is there a chance? Not even remotely.  Good.  Any idea what your sister found? She found something? I'm asking you.  She left a message saying she was vetting a big lead That's gonna make me happy.  No idea.  Got the call.  I'm getting published.  Hey.  congratulations.  The shrine worked.  Totally.  Freebo just called his mother's cell phone.  I'll have his address by tonight.  And then you will let me deal with him.  Ramon,you've done your job.  I'm gonna take it from here,okay? Go be with your family.  Don't fucking sideline me on this,miguel.  Hey,maria.  Hey.  Your assistant told me you were here.  What do you have on freebo,maria? ramon Well,we're working on some new angles.  Which means you've got shit.  Excuse us.  Go home.  'cause you're not helping here.  Ramon and his temper.  Yeah,I remember.  Buti get it.  I mean,him and oscar were close.  Miguel,I need to talk to you about something else.  Uh oh.  I remember that look.  Chicky hines.  Okay.  He didn't do that carjacking homicide.  We found new evidence,and it checks out,miguel.  I think you convicted the wrong man.  You're serious? I was gonna wait,I mean The timing is Shit.  But if hines is innocent,miguel Miguel,I'm sorry.  Oh,this is frustrating and disappointing.  And,uhi really hate my job right now.  But,hey Don't ever think about holding back on me.  Okay? just like now,you tell me straight.  That's the maria that I've always counted on.  Always can.  When all of this is behind us, I want to get together.  The three of us.  You know,as friends.  It's long overdue.  Night time.  Why you think freebo's still in town? Because I think he killed his girlfriend on sunday.  Jane doe.  How do you know it's his girlfriend? The c. i.  gave me a lead.  I did some follow up.  Whoa,whoa,whoa.  my c. i. ? Do you have a name for jane yet? No,but she was strangled, With is consistent with freebo's m. o.  If you're right, The oscar prado and jane doe cases are linked.  I guess we'll just have to merge them.  Freebo's still out there killing.  We've got to catch him fast.  But we got a lead now.  We find the girlfriend's i. d. , We find her place, Her friends,her family, Then we find him.  I'll coordinate with the feds.  Ramos,reach out to street patrol.  Anton is my contact.  If you wear him out or blow his cover   I know how to work a c. i. ,quinn.  So unless there's some other reason You don't want me to talk to him Solid police work,morgan.  That's how you earn your shield.  Thanks,sarge.  All right.  All right,people.  We're gonna be working late on this.  I'll be working late too.  Ho pad indeed.  All right,teegan, Tell me where your homicidal beau might be.  Freebo.  Hiding out at his dead girlfriend's house? Risky.  Then again,it took me a while to find this place, And I knew who I was looking for.  No tools,no syringe, No kill room,no sure thing.  Hang tight,freebo.  I'll be back before you know it.  Detached garage.  Perfect place for a kill room.  M 6 bayonet,vietnam era.  A family keepsake,maybe? Oscar tried to kill freebo with it.  It's only fitting I use it to complete the task.  Shit.  It's time for a decision,dexter.  Having this child Is a huge mistake.  I've weighed out all the pros and cons, And all I've got are cons.  I've been thinking the same thing.  I'm keeping it.  I've made a lot of mistakes in my life.  But being a mother was never one of them.  Dexter,I'd rather do this with you.  But I've been a single parent for a long time now, And I think astor and cody prove That I'm pretty damn good at it.  Is this you being subtle again? No,this is me in all sincerity Saying I will honor your choice.  This child is happening.  But your role in its life is entirely up to you.  Should I take the out rita gave me? What kind of father would I be? After all,I kill people.  Long time,no see.  Oh,god.  What the hell is this?! Show and tell.  It's been so long since you killed them, I was afraid you'd forgotten.  Oh,I'm sure teegan is fresh in your mind.  See,now,I didn't   Aah! fuck! You killed those girls in the everglades, And you got away with it on a bad warrant.  I love those.  And then teegan came along.  First,you drained her of her self respect and hope.  Then last sunday,you choked the life out of her.  No,last sunday I was gettin' high with   It was cheri orcarrie.  She's at  she's at   she's at alpha fee   You seem uncertain.  It's uncomfortable,isn't it? Just when you think you've answered all the questions, Another one smacks you in the face.  Life,life,life.  Life is just like that.  Which is why I prefer death.  Dexter? Is that you? I had the phone records.  Well,what are   Is he in there? Alive? It was self defense.  I found a forensics lead.  It was a long shot.  I wanted to check it out before I wasted anyone's time.  I didn't expect freebo to be here.  He surprised me.  He jumped me With this knife.  That looks like my father's knife from   From vietnam.  He gave that to oscar.  I didn't know what to do.  I fought back.  The knife ended up in his neck.  I   I'm gonna tell you something.  I wasn't sure that I could do this.  But you did.  You did.  We're gonna get rid of the evidence.  No.  no! You should leave  now.  no! Plausible deniability.  Thank you.  You're welcome.

Oh, yeah.  definitely.  No match on her prints.  No missing persons report.  So jane doe     is still jane doe.  And freebo? Same thing, nothing.  Sugar is so much better than the artificial stuff.  Don't you think? Well, I guess.  Do you like milk or cream? Neither.  Not exactly the chatty type, are you? No.  Quinn, morgan.  Man the phones.  Man the streets.  Someone out there's seen freebo.

He went to great trouble to help me Understand how oscar's Last moments unfolded.  Why is he trying so hard to be my friend? We're doing everything we can To find the man who killed oscar.  Yeah, I know you are.  I know you are.  That's why I feel like I'm In such a difficult situation.  What is that? You've dedicated so many Of your resources towards resolving this.  He's trying to end the investigation.  Is it worth it? We both know if you don't catch a perp In the first 48 hours, the chances significantly drop That you ever will   miguel.  This is not the time to give up Or even slow down.  We will find fred bowman.  We'll bring him to justice.  Thank you, maria.  thank you.  Tonight Viernes cultural.  Come by the beach, Grab a beer, uh medianoche.  Right after work.  You'll be home by eight.  I don't know if rita will be up for it.  Syl already talked to her.  She'd love to go.  Then, viernes cultural it is.  Did he say anything About the chicky hines situation? I still got a witness in lockup That says hines is innocent.  Miguel is aware of that.  I know.  To get around to questioning my witness? I assumed he had already.  Not as of this morning.  Well, I'm sure he'll get to it.  I'll talk to him.  We got a new murder victim.  Dumped in the park just like our jane doe.  Some of his skin was sliced off.  It looks like freebo struck again.  All right.  let's get there.  It can't be freebo.  I killed him.  But only miguel and I know that.  And we're not at liberty to tell.  Javier garza.  he was a low life pimp.  He's the one that connected Our jane doe to freebo.  Well, it looks like freebo Paid him back for that.  Well I can't say for certain Until I get this under the 'scope, But I'm guessing we're looking At something like an eight inch blade, Razor sharp.  Single edged.  same type of Instrument used on our jane doe.  So freebo killed javier.  No, he didn't kill javier.  One of the tree trimmers called it in, Said he didn't see anything Or anyone unusual.  It all points to freebo.  Looks like he got a little hungry For flesh this time.  Yeah, what the hell's that about? Do we think he's eating it? There's a lot more cannibalism in this country Than any of you realize.  Maybe the skin's like a trophy or something.  Or he just likes to hurt people.  What do you think, dex? Well, they all sound like good theories to me.  Way to commit.  All right, so far We haven't found shit on freebo.  But now he's giving us a second chance.  So let's not blow it.  Quinn, morgan let's get a canvas going.  One block perimeter.  start with the tree trimmers.  Why don't you take the tree trimmers.  I'm going to start over here.  Oh, gosh.  I wonder why.  Can you come down here? Sure.  Hi.  I'm detective joseph quinn.  There's nothing to worry about here.  Did you guys see anything? How long have you been out here? You been out here a while? What's your name? George washington king.  And you called this in? Yes, I did.  You found the body? Uhno, no.  mario did.  Will you join us please? Van aqui.  Mario, did you notice anyone else? Keep my eyes on my work.  I got to go with freebo on this one.  That means he's stepping out From wherever he's been hiding.  Not so good for our latest victim, But good for us.  Yeah Yeah.  Hey, dex, let's grab a beer tonight, Talk about my jane doe.  I'd like to help you, But I really have too much to deal with right now.  What do you have to deal with? Rita's pregnant.  Say again? Rita's pregnant.  You're lying! I'm not lying.  A baby?! A motherfucking roly poly chubby cheeked shit machine? Are you kidding me? Well, I've never heard it described In quite those words before, but yeah.  That's so great! I'm so happy for you guys.  Well, thank you.  Baby on board.  I've got to get on board.  Grab a sweater.  It'll get cool later.  You okay? I always get my morning sickness Late in the day.  You want to stay home? we don't have to go.  No.  The prados will understand.  No.  I was looking forward to seeing syl.  And I know how much you love Hanging out with miguel.  Miguel.  my new \"bestest\" friend.  Besides, the doctor says The way I'm feeling is fine.  What else did the doctor say? He asked me a million questions About my medical history.  There's a form for you to fill out too, But I told him you were adopted.  I mean Are there any details that you do know? Like mom was killed by a chainsaw.  My brother was killed by Well, me.  that kind of stuff? No, I don't really know anything.  It's okay.  I could go to the doctor And get checked out, if you want.  You'd do that? Of course.  I'm glad we're in this together, dexter.  You'll make a good father.  You know, if you want to.  Here.  It'll help settle your stomach.  Thank you.  How are you doing with everything else? Good.  I feel better about it now.  Actually kind of excited.  Good.  And dexter? I think he's still A little overwhelmed by everything.  Ughmen.  They're such babies, they need to be carried Kicking and screaming into fatherhood.  I guess they're just scared about losing Their freedom.  Dexter.  I don't know if you officially Got to meet my other brother, ramon.  Beautiful wife, sara.  Nice to meet you.  you too.  Sheriff's department, right? That's right.  So you're the guy that miguel Is always talking about? Oh, don't worry.  Like they say, it's all good.  Yeah, if good means being part Of the team that's never going To catch our brother's murderer.  My gracious brother.  Grab a beer? Gracias, mi amigo.  Para servir.  Free beer.  must be nice to be you.  A lot of people appreciate knowing that I'm on their side.  I understand you're soon to be a father.  Yeah.  What? some mixed emotions there? No.  it's just Yeah, mixed emotions.  I don't know what's more complicated, Having a father or being one.  Butit's good to know you're not taking it lightly.  You'll see your way through it.  Hope so.  So uh Our friend freebo Does he come back from the dead, Or are the police mistaken? I'd venture to guess The police are mistaken.  You're positive? Miguel, he's dead.  I believe you.  Well, good.  You just uh Seem a little   You seem a little unsettled with the whole thing.  That's what he's looking for.  a sign that I'm normal.  Uh to be honest, I haven't been sleeping too well lately.  Just know you did the right thing, my friend.  And it will never be forgotten.  A full day of work.  an evening of socializing.  And now finally.  The calm, cool, aloneness of my apartment.  Hello, nathan marten.  \"cheerios\" man.  My animal instincts are never wrong.  Hello, nathan marten.  \"sexual predator\" You did four years At south bay correctional facility.  Your official status is \"released. \" Which leaves you free to slither about the earth.  Miguel.  You know, I went back to my office, To finish up with some paperwork, And it just It kept on nagging at me.  Cono, what ramon said to you.  I wanted to apologize.  Ah really not necessary.  At least share a drink with me.  Yeah, I'll grab some glasses.  Showing up late at night like this, Is it creepy, or just what friends do? How 'bout out here? My father, he caught me drinking From his bottle of rum when I was, like, 12.  He grabbed that bottle, he threw it at me.  Eight stitches, right in the back Of my head, right there.  Ouch.  He was a college professor back in cuba.  Once he got married and had a couple kids, He realized Time to get away from castro's world.  So we came over on one of these old fishing boats.  I was like, five.  Dexter.  The boat actually sank 50 yards from the shore.  My mother, she had to grab ramon.  My father grabbed me, and they swam to the shore.  Wet foot, dry foot.  Sounds brave.  Yeah.  Yeah, he was a real hero, my father was.  He spent the rest of his life telling everybody What a great man he could have been If it wasn't for castro.  The more he drank, the greater he became.  I would look at him and tell myself \"i'm not going to be like him. \" You succeeded.  Yes, I did.  You know what the funny thing is? In his eyes, I was a failure.  I could never measure up.  My father was disgusted by me.  Disgusted? Then no offense to the dead, But your father was an idiot.  Never said that to anyone before.  Not rita.  Not my sister.  Yeah, yeah but dexter   They wouldn't understand.  You know that? They don't know what it is to be a man.  To be a son.  With all the pfffp pressure.  You grow up to be exactly the man Your father molded you to be.  And still Not be good enough! Exactly.  It was even harder on oscar.  You know, by the time he was born, My father was hardly even around.  I mean I tried to take care of him, Look aft   you know.  I'm sorry.  that I killed him.  To oscar.  To oscar.  So, dexter I think I have an answer For our other little problem.  Yes, I think I got it all figured out.  All we have to do Is get freebo's body, we dump it.  Then I can call ramon.  Tell him that I received an anonymous tip About where freebo can be found, That would close the case.  And we can all put it behind us.  Sorry, it's not possible.  Of course it is.  I'll help.  Miguel, the body's gone.  I'll get it.  just tell me where it is.  He's not going to give up.  He needs to see something.  I'll take you there.  Tomorrow.  huh? Lunchtime.  Okay.  I'll pick you up.  But look, dexter.  You're not in this alone, huh? It's you and me.  Together.  That's the problem.  This whole \"together\" thing.  Hey, stranger.  Shit.  All right, look.  It's one thing for you to come to the club.  But don't be tracking me down all over the place.  I called you three times, if you'd bothered To return any of those phone calls, You could have picked the location.  No, I'm sorry doesn't work that way.  Shit.  This is bullshit.  What do you want? Tell me about javier.  Okay, in case you haven't heard, He's dead.  I have heard.  what else do you know? That you were one of the last ones To talk to him.  Looks like having a conversation With you can be dangerous to one's health.  Who had problems with javier? I don't know.  But I'm thinking I shouldn't give you any more names, Or they might end up dead too.  Well, you better give me something, anton.  I don't like you talking to me that way.  Oh, I'm sorry.  I didn't realize you were such a high class snitch.  Well, no part of me needs this.  So why don't you just let me out of here.   Not till I get some answers.    what, am I your prisoner? Look, we have a deal.  And I'm not leaving until I get some information.  You know something? I know what'll make you leave.  What the fuck? get rid of that.  You sure don't want anyone to know You came to the men's room With your ci and lit up a little joint, do you? Fuckin' flush it.  I can't flush this, mama.  this is premium island lady.  If you light that, I'll arrest you.  Don't worry, there's more than enough.  I'll share.  I told you not to fucking do it! It seems ironic that i, An expert on human dismemberment, Have to pay $800 To have myself virtually dissected.  Check out this brain.  This one belonged to a serial killer Executed last month.  Killed 11 women.  Then he really snapped.  Killed his wife, two kids, and the neighbor's dog.  Why are you showing me this? Look.  How much smaller the right hemisphere is.  This guy sure doesn't process a lot of emotions, huh? And you see all this activity In the sub cortex region? That's where feelings of aggression And violence come from.   Why are you    because.  Look.  It's exactly the same as your brain, dex.  Freebo's final resting place.  How? They dig the graves the day before, They place a tarp over each one.  It wasn't that hard To bring freebo here late at night, Find an open grave to place his body in, And then to Cover it up with a foot of dirt.  And then the next day, They lower a 500 pound casket on top of him, Cover it all up with dirt.  Hiding a body in a cemetery.  You're fucking brilliant.  I'll just get a judge to issue An exhumation order now, and then we   I need you to not do that.  Look, I've never done this before.  I don't know what kind of evidence I left on the body.  Hair, and fibers I can't have it traced back to me.  Fair enough.  Fair enough.  It does leave us with our next little problem.  What is that? Well, we still have someone out there Skinning and killing people.  Yes, we do.  And your homicide squad, they think it's freebo, And they're wasting time and energy Looking for a dead man, When The real killer, whoever that might be, Is out there walking free.  Well how's that our problem? Because justice isn't being served.  Of course.  Of course.  we have to Steer the police in the right direction.  How do we do this? I don't have a fucking clue.  But I've got a feeling you're not going To leave me alone until we figure this out.  Together.  What do you think about cowboys? Rugged american heroes? No, I meant for the baby's room.  Nice.  We can do something different if you want.  Yeah, cowboys are Fine.  Hey, are you ready to go To that yoga class? Sure.  Astor! cody! Come on.  let's go.  Nathan marten.  As the sun begins to set, The lowly scavengers reveal themselves.  Hey, it's the cheerios man.  Who? The guy from the grocery store.  What guy? The man who talked to me.  Dexter knows.  Who is he? He's no one to be concerned about.  Because in a land of predators, A lion never fears the jackal.  And here we go; into another warrior pose.  Feel your hips open up.  We are strong warriors.  All of us.  This is absolutely, without a doubt, The worst moment of my life.  Now let's go into a little free form yoga.  Just let yourself dance.  I was wrong.  this is.  dust dancing against the sunlight.  Be as beautiful As the golden flakes of dust, dexter.  I could probably kill her Before anyone realized what happened.  Excellent.  Now I want all the partners To turn and face their pregnant women.  Take your hand and place it on her belly.  And I want you to send all Of your positive intentions to your unborn baby.  I'm sorry.  I just don't want to hurt you.  Good morning, mr.  prado.  Are you satisfied with the sentencing of chicky hines? I am.  I pushed for the maximum on this case, And I got it, and for just cause.  With mr.  hines behind bars for a very long time, I'm hoping that the families of his victims Can finally find some peace.  Thank you.  Miguel.  maria.  Another win for our team, huh? I have to admit, I'm a little confused.  What happened with the witness I gave you? I thought he had information That exonerated chicky hines? I reviewed his statement, it just didn't add up.  I thought it had at least merited A conversation with him.  I see this kind of stuff all the time, maria.  And I know you do too.  Scumbags trying to play the system, Doing whatever they can to stay out of jail.  Trust me on this one, hm? Ms.  wolf, do you have a statement? Yes, I imagine the assistant district attorney prado, Is going to go home now And strip down to his american flag underwear, And pour himself maybe a nice crime fighting drink.  Make a few fund raising phone calls For his upcoming run for d. a.  But the truth is He just sent an innocent man to prison.  For 28 years.  Ugh, he should be ashamed of himself.  It's despicable.  Someone's got to know who she is.  No luck? I'm thinking of putting her picture on milk cartons.  Not a bad idea.  Yeah, except nobody would ever drink milk again.  Why the fuck did you lock up my ci? Why do you keep calling him your ci? Is there something you're not telling us? You're very curious about me, aren't you? Look at you, changing the subject.  Hey, sarge.  Um, can you ask officer morgan Why my ci's in lockup? He was antagonistic.  he produced a joint.  I warned him not to light it or I'd have to bust him.  He lit it.  I knew I couldn't back down, Or he'd never have to cooperate with me again.  He practically arrested himself.  That makes sense to me.  You got a problem with that? no.  Good.  Cut him loose.  Do I know you? We met at the grocery store the other day.  I don't recall.  You asked my girlfriend's daughter To help you find the cheerios.  Oh.  right, right, right.  So what can I do for you? Shut the fuck up, nathan.  Stay away from my kids.  What? Sorry, buddy, you got the wrong idea.  I saw you at the beach yesterday With your camera.  I'm a photographer.  I always have a camera with me.  I know who you are.  I know what you are.  Once.  Once I made a horrible mistake.  And I paid the price for it.  I did my time.  But I'm not like that anymore.  I learned my lesson.  I've changed.  You haven't changed.  that's impossible.  We are what we are.  Night.  Good for the hunter.  bad for the hunted.  Nathan marten.  Is your past the prologue to your future? From the outside, he looks normal.  But like me, his brain is flawed And he has a compulsion he's unable to control.  We're really not so different, Nathan and i.  Except that I would never hurt a child.  Then again, nathan has never killed anyone.  Which means he doesn't fit my code.  I have other problems to deal with besides nathan.  Miguel prado.  And teegan campbell.  If I take care of one, I take care of the other.  It's a new day in miami.  Perfect time to help deb help herself.  One of the things that makes my sister a good cop Is that she's like a dog with a bone.  Once she's got her teeth into something, She'll never let go.  All I have to do is lead her to the bone.  Hey, papa! Oh, god.  almost forgot.  Isn't it great?! Nice.  Have you started thinking about names yet? Not that I want to push it on you or anything, But, if you have a girl, Debra's a really good name.  Deb, I should tell you Oh, my god.  what happened? Nothing happened.  It's just I'm not sure I'm going to be there to raise the baby.  What? I don't know if I'm going to be a father to the kid.  Of course you are, you moron.  Deb   shut the fuck up! How could you even say you're not going To be a father to that kid? I mean, where would you be without harry? And he wasn't even your biological father.  I just think I'm going to be a lousy father.  I don't want to screw the kid up.  Would you please stop doing that? Then stop saying stupid things.  I mean, first of all, who are we kidding? You're going to be a great father.  And second And much more important, big dumb brother of mine, This isn't about you.  Who's it about? The baby.  So it doesn't matter how scared you are, How reluctant or unprepared you might feel, The baby comes first.  And that baby needs you.  So you're just going to have to set aside all of   Holy shit.  that's my jane doe.  It's about time.  Are you sure? Yeah, that's her.  teegan campbell.  It looks like her.  Yeah, I gotta go, dex.  this is big.  What's that for? I know you, dex.  You're the best brother in the world.  And you can do this.  And if you don't trust yourself, Trust me.  I'm the smart one in the family.  They look motivated.  Anything? Once morgan here found out That jane doe was teegan campbell, It was a quick step to find her apartment.  And guess who'd been hiding out there? Freebo.  his shit was everywhere.  All kinds of fresh fingerprint evidence.  That's good.  Fucking guy's got an airtight alibi.  We checked the call logs.  Freebo called abby wilson four hours Before the estimated time of teegan's murder.  We followed up with abby.  Yeah, but get this.  She's saying she spent all day in bed with freebo.  If that theory holds, That means freebo didn't kill teegan.  And there are several calls from this phone To teegan's cell after she was killed.  Assuming freebo made those calls, He may not even know that she's dead.  We know javier was killed by the same person Who killed teegan, so He's off the hook for that as well.  I was just telling miguel How we weren't giving up on freebo.  Now I have to call him and tell him That he's probably right? Freebo's probably long gone? Looks that way.  What is that? You stuck a piece of chewing gum on it? I'm sorry.  This is a deliberate insult against me, And my people! Come on! come on! Asswipe.  Who the fuck are his people? I don't know.  Little scientists, I guess.  The lieutenant's right.  We're starting all over here.  We need to get out there And see what we can shake loose.  We're looking at two cases now.  Ramos, liason with tri state p. d.  On the freebo situation.  Quinn, morgan.  You stay on the skinner.  And you need to mend fences with that ci.  He's part of that world.  We need all the help we can get on this.  Okay? Lucky break, huh? Seeing that flyer? You make your own luck.  And now that I've dealt with teegan Yep? Hi, it's dexter.  good news I was going to call you.  we need to meet.  Uhokay.  Today, right after work.  Under the bridge, near the beach club.  Hey, dexter.  Miguel.  So you said on the phone we have good news.  Yes.  It was just the other day that I was stressing The importance of getting the police Off of the freebo trail.  And today Suddenly I get the word that the police Have done exactly that.  I don't know how you did it, dexter, But I'm impressed.  Actually, it wasn't me at all.  It was my sister, debra.  You're a little uneasy with compliments.  Aren't you? We all need to be liked.  I also notice that you always Have your guard up around me.  Oh that's not true.  Ah, it's okay.  Actually, it's a good thing.  I appreciate that you're a cautious man.  It's actually a very valuable trait to have, Especially considering our circumstances.  It's just my nature.  I just want you to know That you don't have to worry about me.  We're on the same side here.  Honestly, I try to avoid taking sides In most situations.  There you go again.  Always being careful.  Okay Come on.  I got a gift for you.  A gift? You know when you took care Of my brother's murderer, You gave me, uh, peace.  Now let me give you peace.  A shirt? The shirt.  This is the shirt I was wearing When freebo met his end.  That's his blood, right there.  This shirt implicates me in his death.  Accessory after the fact.  Why? Because I trust you.  I trust you.  And I want you to trust me.  Same question.  why? Because I like you.  I like working with you.  You're a good man, dexter morgan.  Potencial.  You've got a lot of potential in you.  Sometimes I think that you are the only one who doesn't know that.  So I'm going to be seeing you again soon.  All right? Yep.  okay.  Is it possible I've actually made a friend? Someone I can trust with my dark secrets? Or am I being foolish For even asking myself these questions? Hey, listen, if you've come to arrest me, I'm clean.  I don't even have my cuffs.  Look anton I feel Not good about what happened.  Yeah? yeah.  Came on a little strong, didn't you? Yeah, well you kinda pushed me into it, didn't you? Yeah, okay.  I'll admit that.  All right, so, um I feel not good too.  Okay.  I've even been working on a song.  For you.  Kind of an apology.  No fucking way! Yeah, yeah.  um It's um It's not done yet.  Hey, you.  Hey, dexter.  I was wondering if you were coming by later tonight? If I do, it'll be pretty late.  I've got some work stuff I got to take care of.  Well, do you think you could get a chance To pick up some milk for the kids? For their cereal in the morning.  I'll try to remember.  He wrote this for me.  You're the puta mala flaca? Yeah, that's me.  She's the skinny mean bitch.  So here I am again.  Drawn to the house of a man who doesn't meet the code.  But maybe there's another code.  A code that says, \"you've stepped uninvited Into my world. \" And that's a place where I decide Who gets to live.  And who doesn't.  I am not like you! Nobody hurts my children.  Milk.  Thank you.  You're welcome.  So how was your day? Long.  You? It was good.  yeah, mine was good too Took care of some stuff I needed to do.  That always feels nice.  Just sending out my positive intentions To our baby.  So there it is.  I'm going to be a father.  And raise my child.  It's what any good man would do.  After all It's a jungle out there.

The oscar prado case? Freebo killed a senior a. d. a. 's brother.  Except he didn't kill oscar.  I did.  Dexter, I don't know if you officially got to meet My other brother, ramon.  So you're the guy That miguel is always talking about? What do you have on freebo, maria? ramon.  Well, we're working on some new angles.  Which means you've got shit.  excuse us.  Freebo's still out there killing.  We gotta catch him fast.  Holy shit, that's my jane doe.  Teegan campbell.  I was just telling miguel How we weren't giving up on freebo.  Now I have to call him and tell him That he's probably right.  Freebo's probably long gone, And he didn't kill teegan.  Looks that way.  Yuki amado, internal affairs.  Do you know a joey quinn? Be really cool if you could get next to him.  You know, do a little recon.  Yuki, that's not gonna happen.  If you light that, I'll arrest you.  I told you not to fucking do it! Why the fuck did you lock up my c. i. ? Why do you keep calling him your c. i. ? Is there something you're not telling us? What happened with the witness I gave you? I thought he had information that exonerated chicky hines.  I reviewed his statement.  It just didn't add up.  Anton, I feel not good about what happened.  I feel not good too.  This is the shirt I was wearing When freebo met his end.  That's his blood right there.  This shirt implicates me in his death.  I trust you, and I want you to trust me.  Is it possible I've actually made a friend, Someone I can trust with my dark secrets? Or am I being foolish for even asking myself these questions? Role playing.  It's such an important part of growing up.  When we were kids, whatever role deb assigned me   Evil monster, treacherous nazi, horrible alien   I played them to perfection.  We should tell them.  About the baby? I don't want them to hear it from somebody else.  Okay.  Kids.  Dexter and I have something we want to talk to you about.  What? We're having a baby.  You're gonna have a new little brother Or little sister to play with.  Which one? Which one would you like? A puppy.  You can have a puppy and a baby.  But you're not even married.  No, no, we're not.  Why not? Inever really thought about it.  You know, I'm gonna grab the potato salad So I don't forget.  Family man.  Husband and father.  Sounds so upstanding.  Harmless.  Much better than lives alone keeps to himself.  Should we? I mean, it's not the worst idea in the world.  Should we what? Get married.  Dex.  Yeah, cool.  You'd be my dad.  Look, this is not something we're gonna decide today.  Go get your stuff together.  We don't wanna be late for the prados.  Dex.  That was ridiculous.  The only roles I had trouble with were good guys   Heroes, knights in shining armor.  It just never felt right.  Not now.  Please, miguel, listen to me.  you can handle this, ramon.  Okay, let me help you.  Oh, no need.  Paper plates go right into the garbage.  And we'll be back with dessert.  Thank you.  I'm going.  Please, I really want you to stay.  Hey, easy.  I mean it, dexter, what were you thinking? Proposing to me like that? Oh.  sorry.  With the baby and all, it just made sense.  People don't get married because it makes sense.  They don't? Would you have asked me to marry you If I wasn't pregnant? I don't know.  I married paul because I was pregnant.  And I won't marry again Unless it's because someone loves me.  I understand why you feel that way.  Being a father and being a husband Are two very different things.  You don't have to be both.  I don't want both Unless it's real.  Real.  How do you show someone real love When you don't even know what it feels like? don't leave, ramon.  It's just another empty lead, Another worthless tip.  And I'm gonna keep chasing them Until I find the one that leads to my bro   Our brother's killer, okay? Stay, ramon.  come on, for your family.  How 'bout I go for my family? Ramon, no.  I have to go.  no.  Sara.  I got him.  Ramon.  Come here.  Everything all right? He's obsessed.  He's drinking more than usual.  He's not going to stop looking for oscar's killer Until it takes him all the way down.  Grief hits some harder than others.  You know, we could help ramon find peace If we told him oscar's killer was dead.  If we told him, then he'd know.  Ramon and I have shared and have kept Each other's secrets all of our lives.  It's not just your secret.  Which is why I'm asking you.  Miguel, he seems unstable.  He's troubled.  he has a temper.  He's my brother.  I can help him.  you're it! You're it! He needs to know that freebo's dead.  It's a big burden.  Not everybody can handle a secret like that.  You're uncomfortable enough with me knowing.  Trusting my brother is just   it's too much right now.  I get it.  Actually, you do.  Don't worry about it.  Ramon, he'll calm down eventually.  Not a chance.  This won't go away.  Miguel can't see what a loose cannon his brother is.  He might need some perspective.  Uncle miguel, astor won't let me play in the cabin.  don't worry, buddy.  I'll talk to her.  Astor, carlos wants to play in the cabin now.  So? So sharing is one of the rules.  Whose rule? you're not my father.  Astor! Apologize to dexter.  Think she's reacting to my botched proposal? She's so concerned about us not being married.  I don't think it's just the marriage.  It's the new baby.  She's afraid she's not gonna be special anymore.  Wow, you're good.  I know my daughter.  She just needs some attention, Some reassurance.  Astor! Astor is auditioning various roles   Wounded child, sullen pre teen, Oppressed youth   Finding out who she wants to play.  Dramatic exit stage left.  I can't force my way into rita's life, Any more than I can force miguel To trust me over his own brother.  I need to take a cue from astor, Get their attention.  But first things first.  I do have a day job.  That's what real love looks like.  Well, real love plus loss.  Is that what rita needs to see in me? Could be a problem.  That the fiancee? Not anymore.  That's fiona kemp.  She came to meet the vic for a movie.  She saw the assailant.  He knocked her over as he fled.  That's how she got the bum knee.  Her description fits the one we've got In a series of break ins in the neighborhood.  Same m. o.  too.  Back door crowbarred open.  We could barely get her to let go of him.  Deb, your butt's buzzing.  Christ.  Quinn here yet? Yeah, I just saw him pull up.  Jesus, you should have beat me here driving this thing.  I got stuck on the causeway behind a stalled car.  I know you earn more with a shield, but come on.  Got a great lease is all.  what do we got? Jack rice, 34.  His head's caved in.  Looks like a \"b\" and \"e\" gone sideways.  A bunch of priors in the area.  Witnesses? Just one.  Jack took the day off to see a matinee with me.  A romantic comedy.  He calls them chick flicks, But he knows they make me happy, so I'm sure he was a great guy.  But the man you saw fleeing, He was about six foot, you said? And I met jack at the coffee place Where I work.  When he came in, Something inside of me just recognized him, Even though we'd never met.  Have you ever felt that way before? Too many times.  We can look at some mug shots.  Maybe describe the man you saw To a sketch artist.  A what? I i'm staying with jack.  Jack has to go to the morgue.  Forensics is gonna need her clothes.  Well, why don't you tell her? You can't take that.  It's his favorite cap.  Ma'am the cap needs to come with me.  Sorry, fiona.  We'll give it back to you when we're done.  You won't.  Hey, look at me.  Come on, right here.  I'm telling you That i, joseph quinn, will personally make sure That hat comes back to you unharmed.  He's good.  Who knew? Is there anything else you want to keep of jack's? Maybe one of his shirts? Come on.  He's like the fucking witness whisperer.  Maybe he should propose to rita for me.  Astor, that's so unfair.  You're my little girl, and you always will be.  You know that, right? rita, you in there? rita, you in there? Yeah, just one second.  Astor, I asked you a question.  Look, whether dexter and I get married Is between him and me.  You and i, we have to work On being kinder with each other.  Do you think you can help me with that? Please? Rita, we need you out here.  Look, I've gotta get back to work.  We're gonna talk about this tonight, okay? All right.  We need to switch rooms.  We were expecting to watch the sun set From our honeymoon suite, Because, obviously, we're on our honeymoon.  But we couldn't see anything.  Right, uh Well, the sun sets in the west.  And miami is on the east coast of florida, So there's really nothing we can   The brochure said, \"watch the sun set over the ocean. \" Didn't it, honey? It may have said \"sun rise. \" We want your best room.  The honeymoon suite is our best room.  There's always a better room.  Look, I'm sorry.  Perhaps I can offer you a complimentary breakfast.  I want a higher floor, A better view, and better lighting.  It was way too dark in there with the curtains closed.  How 'bout a one hour spa treatment? I want a better room.  All right, we don't have a better room Unless you build one, and being a bitch Isn't gonna change that.  Rita.  Excuse me.  I'll be right with you.  We can't have this conversation again.  I know.  I'm sorry.  This is the second time this week.  Plus, you're always on a break or calling in sick.  I don't know what's going on, But, honestly, it's always something.  And now I have to comp the honeymoon suite.  I'm really sorry, but I just can't afford To employ you anymore.  Now, how can we make this right? Some people are ticking time bombs.  Ramon is one of them.  And miguel needs to see him explode.  The inciter, That's a role I've always been good at.  Pick up for morgan.  Ramon.  hey, how you doing? Dexter.  Oh, that's right.  miguel said you two came here.  It's your secret spot, right? Not anymore.  Oh, don't worry.  I'll keep it between the three of us.  Jefe, another rum and coke.  Oh, and could I get some extra pickles? Hey, sorry about the way astor treated little carlos yesterday.  Oh, right, you left.  It was a minor turf war.  Don't worry, I watched out for him.  Carlos is a tough kid.  He can hold his own.  Yeah, I'm sure.  Sure you want to be drinking that? If I wasn't sure, I wouldn't drink it.  It's just You know, miguel's worried about you.  No offense, dexter, But if miguel has a problem with me He will tell me himself.  Right.  I mean, he said he did.  But, yeah, he will again if he needs to.  What goes on between me and my brother Is between me and my brother.  Absolutely.  I just happened to be there When miguel needed someone to talk to.  Since I've been through it too.  My mother was killed when I was a kid.  I'm sorry.  So I know how it feels.  But it gets easier.  Like miguel said, when he accepted his loss And found closure, he moved on.  Hey! Nobody is accepting anything.  Okay? And when your homicide department Gets off its ass and starts doing its fucking job, Maybe then me and my brother will move on.  Extra pickles.  Thanks.  I must have misinterpreted what he said.  Yeah.  You did.  Well, enjoy your dinner.  And tell carlos I said howdy.  I knew I'd find you still here.  No rest for the wicked.  What brings you to these parts? Uh, I wanted to ask you about chicky hines.  Again? I got a witness who can provide An alibi for hines.  It checks out.  I told you I reviewed his statement.  But you never talked to him.  Oh, come on, maria.  Your witness is a habitual criminal Who's just trying to beat his latest drug rap.  Yeah, but that doesn't mean it isn't true.  And he can clear hines.  Have you even met chicky hines? I mean have   Have you read his jacket? Because it's   Hines didn't do this crime.  Okay.  What's this really about? An innocent man behind bars.  Maybe.  Maybe there's something else at play.  Accepting the truth about james doakes, That was hard for all of us.  I wasn't expecting that.  I know.  Look, I shouldn't even have mentioned it.  But, come on, he was your partner.  He's your friend.  Maybe you think He was railroaded, I don't know.  And maybe that's coloring how you're seeing hines.  I'll admit it was hard.  But you know me, you know I'm a pro.  I also know you're human like the rest of us.  I'm just putting that out there because we're friends.  The fiancee's working with a sketch artist now.  So far it matches what the burglary division Already has on the break ins, So she's not giving us anything we don't already have.  Yeah, except for more stories about how perfect Her dead fiance was.  Hey, it's not easy realizing you're alone in the world.  What's the blood splatter telling you? Just clarifying some discrepancies.  Well, clarify fast.  Hey, I'm gonna wrap this thing up, Get you two guys back on the skinner case.  Yeah, you're preaching to the choir, sir.  Morgan, your ass is   Thank you.  I fucking noticed it.  Comp tickets to my keynote address At the forensics conference.  Not really my thing.  I'm flea combing my dog that night.  I'm seeing my little girl that night.  You don't even know the date.  I gotta keep my schedule open for her.  Et tu, dex tay? Wouldn't miss it.  Masuka.  He's chosen the role of court jester.  Now we only like him when he's making us laugh.  Still, there's something to be said For being a character actor.  The lead players with all those emotions, Must be exhausting.  Looks like the sketch that burglary already has On the break in suspect.  You couldn't get any more out of her? Officer morgan, the woman's a wreck.  Sohe didn't have any distinguishing marks, Any scars or tattoos? Uh, maybe.  Um, I don't remember.  He ran right by you.  I was surprised.  Let's take a deep breath.  Close your eyes.  Try to picture it again.  It's so horrible.  My jack just lying there.  Why is this happening? Okay, let's not picture it anymore.  Jack's never coming back.  Let's focus on something else right now, okay? We'll just focus on something else.  Fiona.  hi.  How are you holding up? I'm not helping at all.  Who you kidding? you're doing great.  You're a champ.  I'm trying, but   Why don't we take a break from all this And we'll go look at some pictures together, okay? Okay.  We'll be in interview three with the mug books.  I'll set it up.  That's okay, I got it.  They say this part should pass soon.  They say I should glow.  Am I glowing? You are to me.  I can't believe I called a guest a bitch.  Sounded like an accurate description.  I think I'm gonna talk to my boss And ask for my job back.  Really? I always got the impression You didn't particularly like that job.  It's a job.  No one's gonna hire me knowing I have to go On maternity leave.  Plus I barely have any savings.  I'm pregnant.  No health insurance.  My insurance would cover you.  Rita, if we got married we'd have joint assets.  You wouldn't have to worry.  And let's not forget about marital deductions.  With astor and cody as dependants   That's one ugly guitar.  Ugly? pssh.  A beat up guitar like this Speaks to the experience of its owner.  The many hard roads we've traveled together.  So you've had it a long time.  No, a couple of weeks.  Picked it up at a pawn shop for 20 bucks.  Gives me a certain mystique, doesn't it? You are full of shit.  So what do you need, officer? A stiff drink after a shit day.  And you came here? For the margaritas, trust me.  One margarita.  How well do you know quinn? He have something to do with your day being shit? Maybe.  I've heard stuff about him.  And he comes off really slick, And then he turns around and he's all sensitive And caring about people.  What's his story, is he a good guy or a bad guy? Does it have to be either/or? In my world, yeah.  But I can't figure out which one he decided on.  All I know is, um, Quinn helped me out of a jam when I was in trouble.  The man gave me an opportunity, and I took it.  Okay.  Besides, without quinn, You would have no c. i. , And I'd be drinking alone.  I doubt that.  Oh, you're a hungry man.  And you're a beautiful meal.  You, uh, you looking for anything special tonight? Your eyes.  They're soulful.  Well, the compliments are free.  But an hour of my time costs.  It might be more than an hour.  Take a pass, sergeant.  Tonight, for a couple of hours anyway, I'm not a   Tonight, all night, I am.  Shit, this is a sting.  Just shut up and go with this.  You god damn deadbeat.  You come up to my room and you ain't got no cash! Well, nobody sees jazmin That ain't got no cash.  You wasted my time, you motherfucker.  Wow, so she threw up? Yep.  Her answer apparently.  Not really the response you want to hear To a marriage proposal.  Yeah, hence my call to you.  And the bribe of a beer.  You've obviously had one successful proposal.  Tell me your secret, oh wise one.  Well, whatever you do, Don't suggest eloping because a wedding conflicts With a big case you've got coming up.  You did that? It went over about as well as yours did.  I'm not the only hopeless one.  You and me, buddy, Making the women of america sick.  I did eventually figure out That women tend to lead with their hearts.  So you might try leading with yours.  Is that the only option? Only one that works, hermano.  Oh, speaking of hermanos, I ran into ramon last night.  I heard.  Actually, I got an earful.  Sorry.  I tried to reach out to him, make a connection.  I think I just upset him more.  It's okay.  It led to a really good talk.  Talk? I didn't tell him, dexter.  I keep my promises.  But when and if you ever feel comfortable telling him, I'm just saying I think ramon's ready.  Miguel keeps trying to cast ramon In the role of misunderstood good guy.  Personally, I think he makes a much better bad guy.  I just have to convince miguel.  A donut and a ticket to hear me speak? I'll take a donut.  You already got a ticket.  You're bribing people to come to your keynote address? The whole donut thing works for you, doesn't it? The blind leading the blind.  Donut and a ticket? Just fucking take one.  Hey.  something up, lew? You remember that statement you took From the chicky hines alibi? You want me to recite it by heart? So you buy it? Even though the alibi comes from somebody Trying to beat a drug rap? It's solid.  Is the a. d. a.  still sitting on it? Well, then you did all you could.  Maybe.  Hell musta froze over 'cause cops won't eat donuts anymore.  Well, maybe the price is a little too high.  Oh, please.  Well, why wouldn't they want to support A valuable colleague during his shining moment? You want an honest answer to that? It was rhetorical.  All right.  All right, tell me.  You're, like, the foulest person I've ever met.  Every line out of your mouth Is a sick joke.  I'm funny.  Yeah, you can be.  You can also be completely revolting.  And sometimes that's all people see.  What do you know? You're the fucking new guy.  Hey, dr.  phil, your girlfriend's coming in again To look at more mug books, so Hi there, deb.  Help yourself.  I saved you one with the cream filling.  Ugh, freak.  Sergeant batista.  It's you.  With clothes.  I mean, different clothes.  Yeah, I'm detective barbara gianna, metro vice.  Can we talk? Look, this department has had a lot of shit Dumped on it with the bay harbor butcher.  And now you, a sergeant, Are looking to make the news getting busted with hookers.  Now, I turn you in now, I save this department worse later.  'cause guys like you never learn.  Hey, look, maybe I'm an asshole, but   Do not Insult me by saying this is your first time.  Okay, 'cause I hear this same horseshit sob story From every john I bust.  Does any part of you Think that any part of me Is proud of what I've done? No part of me really cares.  It's just that I destroyed my marriage.  I lost my little girl.  I'm a divorced cop Halfway down the road to a full blown cliche A divorced, alcoholic cop.  And I needed to fight that Loneliness.  So I found affection any way I could.  I mean, hookers? I needed to connect with someone, Anyone, Who wouldn't hurt me back no more.  That's it.  Not special.  Just true.  I hate anyone who disgraces the badge.  I hate liars worse.  I'm not lying.  I know.  Are we good? You keep your dick in your pants Unless you're, \"a,\" playing with yourself Or, \"b,\" you are doing something consensual and legal.  Then we're good.  Ramon, what are you   Any progress on finding oscar's killer? We're liaising with the feds In case he went over the border.  But what if he's right here in our own backyard? It's an ongoing concern, ramon.  But not a priority, right? Hey.  lower your voice.  Is there a problem here? Yeah, sergeant, Your people don't know what the fuck they're doing.  Hey, that credit you get for being a cop, It has a limit.  So you do have a game plan.  'cause it doesn't seem to involve listening to solid leads.  Every lead has been followed.  Then why am I getting calls from a guy Who says he saw freebo in miami? I'll tell you why, because you ignored him.  He called you four times.  Never happened.  okay.  Ramon, you give me this tipster's name, I will personally follow through.  The motherfucker was anonymous, maria.  Oh, did I forget to leave my name? Sorry.  But he knew things about this case.  Like freebo had a girlfriend, teegan.  A lot of people know that, sir.  I passed her photo all over town.  Maybe the tipster wanted reward money.  You can find excuses, or you can get off your asses And try finding my brother's killer.  Okay, ramon, you need to leave now! Just do your fucking job.  You wanna give his brother the heads up? You do it.  I'm a little tired of the prado family right now.  That was easier than I thought.  Miguel won't be happy to hear ramon's throwing tantrums With fellow law enforcement.  Not that I'll rely on that alone.  The stakes are too high.  And I'm on a roll.  Maybe I should call rita with an anonymous tip To marry me.  Oh, what the fuck, dex? Good, you're here.  Put this on.  I don't need a giant condom.  I need your spatter report on jack rice.  I'm working on it.  Just put on the suit and the gloves And the mask, please.  Fine.  The sooner I'm done with the weeping fiancee, The better off I'll be.  Raw emotion.  Not your forte, huh? What the hell is that supposed to mean? Hey, it's not mine either.  It's easy as hell for quinn.  Think he's just nicer than me? I don't know about nicer.  Although studies show that emotional intelligence Plays a greater role in individual success Than anything that can be measured On a standard i. q.  test.  Come here.  Stand right here and bash this for me, Will ya? Are you calling me an emotional idiot? If you're an idiot, I'm a vegetable.  Well, that's for fucking sure.  Fuckin' a, dex! Sorry.  You know what, fiona has her facts wrong.  She described the assailant As six foot.  But calculating jack rice's height, Allowing for the upward angle   Layman here.  Well, your body acts as a shield.  And all of this is what your body doesn't block.  So the killer stuns the victim with the first blow.  He falls to his knees.  The second blow brings us blood.  If the killer was six foot, The spatter shadow at the crime scene Would be taller and wider.  Instead, it's an exact match For your shadow.  Ergo, rice's killer was approximately Your height and weight.  You mean fucking weep bag fiona's height and weight? No, I mean   I missed that.  interesting.  You and jack planning a big wedding? Yeah.  Jack had a lot of friends, yeah.  The thing is, I went through his address book And I called a lot of people, And none of them have ever heard of you.  Well, we like to keep to ourselves, you know? When was that taken? It was right after we met.  Did he get a chance to see it before you killed him? What? Uh, wh what is she talking about? I don't   It's photo shopped, fiona.  It's really good work, though.  Really good.  did you do it yourself? God, no.  See, I'm thinking maybe you broke into his apartment To leave that as a surprise.  He comes home, tries to throw your ass out, And you kill him.  No, I would never hurt jack.  We were getting married.  You heard about the break in on tv, Then you create the same sketch that they show on tv, The same crowbar in the back door.  You bash your own fucking knee in! Did he ever even talk to you, fiona? Did he ever even say more than \"one fucking coffee to go\"?! That's it.  This is over.  I'm sorry? Wait outside, officer.  I'll take it from here.  It's all right.  I know How it really was Between you and jack.  I know.  You all right? Yeah.  It's safe.  it's just me and you.  Can you believe this shit? It's amazing.  she's so convincing.  I'm talking about him.  I'm gonna kick his cadillac driving ass.  Before jack, My life was an unanswered question.  Unanswered question.  Days and nights spent looking for something.  Quinn played me like a fucking $20 guitar.  The first time he came into the cafe, I  i felt him.  We were connected, you know? Everywhere I went, he was with me.  Jack made me real.  Made me real.  She believes it down to her core.  It's not an act.  The only actor in that room is quinn.  If fiona can be this convincing About someone she didn't even know, I should be able to convince rita And others.  Ellen.  Hello? Ellen? Thank christ you found the place.  I couldn't have waited much longer.  A client just sent me these.  Without a responsible adult To share them with or shame me, I would eat them all.  I would.  Try that one.  Seriously, ganache frosting.  Oh, what the hell? So I'm guessing you wanted to meet for reasons Other than working up a case of type 2 diabetes.  The chicky hines conviction.  Yeah.  Not the justice system's finest hour.  My people have come across evidence That could get the case reopened.  I like the sound of the quid.  What's the pro quo? Nada.  Witness statement giving hines an alibi, Another suspect.  All of which checks out.  Two plus decades doing this job, And a cop's never once handed me A get out of jail card.  Especially when that cop's got a history With the a. d. a.  who put my guy away.  This isn't about miguel prado.  It's about doing what's right.  Well, I'll take \"yes\" for an answer then.  Prado know you're coming to me with this? Guess he'll find out.  Well, you better be wearing old clothes, Because the shit is gonna be flying In your direction.  Cupcakes and scotch.  Come on.  Two fingers.  Yeah, I'm tellin' you, I saw freebo again.  No, man, I'm not comin' in.  Fine, I'll meet you.  you got a favorite bar? Yeah, I know it.  order me a rum and coke.  I'll be there in ten.  You can lead a horse to water, but you can't make him drink, Unless you order his favorite and keep him waiting.  And waiting.  So the nut job went.  She said she caved his head in To preserve their love.  Good work.  How 'bout I buy you a drink? How 'bout you kiss my ass? Next time you're playing good cop/bad cop, You fucking let me know I'm playing too.  I'm sorry about that.  You're sorry? When'd you figure out she did it? I had a hunch from the beginning.  But I wasn't sure until you were.  Why didn't you tell me? 'cause you'd have blown it.  So fuck you.  Morgan, you got one tool in your toolbox.  And that's a hammer.  You can't help yourself.  So I played off it, and it worked.  You just don't have a poker face yet.  Maybe yours is a little too good.  Don't you have a life? Not lately.  I needed to talk to you about ramon.  Yeah, I heard he made a scene.  Sorry.  Actually, it was an eye opener.  Made me realize you were right.  About? Telling him About freebo.  He's putting his career at risk.  And it could hurt your reputation.  I'm not gonna be responsible for that.  Don't worry.  Ramon will always put family first.  We worked too hard to get to where we are.  He would never jeopardize that.  And we can trust him? He's in a lot of pain.  Which we can end.  Tonight.  Dex   Please.  Just call him.  Hey, ramon, what are you up to? Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Hold on.  Why don't you just get the bartender To call you a taxi, or I'll   Nah, fuck you, miguel.  The motherfucking bartender won't even give me   Fuck.  Having a big night, huh? What I'm having is another drink, But this prick is trying to cut me off.  Oh, and you're here.  Boys' night out.  So why don't we just all go back to my place? We can have syl make a little coffee   I'm not going to your place.  I'm not gonna let sara and the kids see you like this.  Like you're some kind of example in this family? Turning your back on oscarito! This is not the place.  Now, you know that.  Tell me something.  Why are you running your mouth About family business to a god damn stranger? Dexter is not the problem here, ramon.  Now, come on, please.  The two of you coming in here like some fucking kind Of batman and robin.  Keep your fucking hands off of me, pendejo.  I'm sorry, dexter.  I got this.  You sure? He said fuck off.  I'm gonna get another drink.  Hey, that guy over there, the drunk one, He just put his hand on that girl.  She's pretty upset, and I think I saw a gun.  I take no pleasure In manipulating miguel this way.  Still, I think he'd prefer it To my usual alternative.  Hey.  You didn't return my last text.  Well, I guess I ran out of ways to say I won't be your fuckin' rat.  Heard you and quinn had a tricky case.  I just filed the report.  Yeah, I just read it.  According to the report, Quinn cracked the case mostly on his own, And I'm wondering why someone hoping to get her shield Would let him write it up that way.  I wrote the god damn report.  Not him.  He got the confession, so it's his win.  Unless he used you.  You see, he's good at that.  You partner with him, you trust him, And then sooner or later you're questioning yourself.  I mean, he's such a great guy.  It can't be him.  Except the only question he's asking Is how everything can benefit him.  Hey, breakfast.  Thanks for coming.  We used to play on this beach right here.  Me, ramon, oscar.  Sounds fun.  Ah, we had each other.  Always have.  No matter what kind of horrible shit you would pull, They knew you inside out, The good and the bad.  And they were there for you, no matter what.  I never had that.  Maybe you're lucky you don't have it to lose.  You won't be left with a gaping hole.  No, there's still holes.  I just find other ways to fill them.  I lost oscar to drugs Long before he was killed.  And now I'm losing ramon.  I can't fool myself.  He can't be trusted.  It's like I only have one person I can trust anymore.  Yourself.  I was thinking of you.  Oh, don't worry.  I know that trust doesn't come too easy to you.  Is it that obvious? Well, to me.  I can just see that you're used To carrying your secrets to yourself.  Tends to be safer that way.  But it's a hell of a burden, man.  See, I'm used to having a brother.  Share the load.  I'm hoping maybe you'll get used to it too.  To be a brother.  To have a friend.  To have a wife, a family.  Fiona wanted it so bad she invented it, Played all the parts herself.  But if you play a role long enough, Really commit, Does it ever become real? Could I become real? Hi, dexter.  Dexter? This is a surprise.  you didn't call.  Is everything all right? Dexter, what is it? My life has always felt like An unanswered question.  A string of days and nights, Waiting for something to happen, but I didn't know what.  Why is he acting so weird? I don't know.  Rita, we're connected.  Wherever I am, I feel you And the kids With me.  You're what makes me real.  I want us to Always go out for banana splits.  And replant the lemon tree That keeps dying.  And I never, ever want to miss a pizza night.  And that's how I know I want to marry you.  Because something as simple as pizza night Is the highlight of my week.  But not without the kids.  Cody, astor, You guys are my family.  I'm gonna hang on to you for dear life.  Please, say yes.  Yes! Yes, we will marry you.  Most actors toil in obscurity, Never stepping into the spotlight.  But if you hone your craft, Work diligently, You might just find yourself Cast in the role of a lifetime.      Previous EpisodeNext Episode"

Five years ago, he kills his first wife.  Drug overdose.  His pills.  no alibi.  Then he uses her money to go and hire This legal dream team to confuse the jury and   They had to let him go.  Dexter, my hands are tied by the law, And the defense attorneys Get to wipe their asses with it.  And everything that I believe in is compromised.  That's you.  Seems miguel and I understand each other better Than either one of us knows.  I could do us both a favor And look into this wife killer.  When it comes to my brand of justice, I don't have to compromise.  Sliced it.  Yeah.  Thank you again for inviting us.  That massage was amazing.  We spend enough money to be members here.  At least now I have somebody to go to the spa with.  All of that stuff, That's not for men, right, dex? Lying naked on a table, helpless, No thanks.  So, rita, why don't you tell dexter My great idea? Great idea? Well, syl has offered to list My house with her agency So we can buy something bigger together.  You're just throwing money away On that apartment.  And that way You can move in sooner.  I was actually thinking I might keep my place.  You were? Well, I could always sublet it.  At some point we're gonna need a bigger home.  You definitely need something That you can grow into.  This is how customer must have felt, Surrounded on all sides, Doomed.  So why don't we talk about all this After we eat? Oh, the line's thinning.  Come on, rita.  You have got to try these crepes.  It's going to be okay.  Trust me.  I'm so sorry, man.  Syl, she gets these ideas in her head, And it's like you can't stop her.  I guess I always knew at some point I'd have to give up my place.  I just didn't think it'd be so soon.  Every man needs his privacy.  Some more than others.  But that's why god created golf.  How many times have I walked down this sidewalk? Sun in my face.  Cool ocean breeze on my skin.  Taken a dip in the pool to relax, Appreciating the wisdom of the three little words No children allowed.  Are those times gone forever? Before I even think About following up on miguel's lead, I need to make sure ethan turner meets my code.  How can rita expect me to just pick up and move? This is my home.  My sanctuary.  Careful.  Leave it.  Not really rita's style.  But it's mine.  Not anymore, son.  In marriage, everything's 50/50.  What's yours is rita's.  Better hope she doesn't insist on a place with central air.  Rita and syl may be busy planning my life And where I'll live.  But there are some things I still control.  Right on time.  You're getting pretty good at this secret meeting stuff.  Yeah, well, we've done it enough.  With bumpkus to show for it.  It's \"bupkus. \" Not \"bumpkus. \" it's yiddish.  No, it's not.  You wanna bet? How much? Make it a million.  I'll take a check.  Where's your guy? In the alley behind you.  Wonderful.  I love the smell of ass in the morning.  Hey, you're the one that's been all over mine for leads.  Don't be hating where I find them.  I know, I know.  Well, you better split before we get made.  Well, that's cute.  What? You.  Trying to protect me like that, it's cute.  I'm trying to protect my investigation.  And fuck you.  What the hell? He wasn't like this earlier.  I'm trying to find whoever's responsible for skinning people, Not to stage an intervention.  You think your murders are somehow connected to freebo? He used to score from freebo.  It's worth a shot, right? Excuse me.  Anyone in there? Anyone fucking in there at all? I'll bet you're real good with kids too.  Hey, tilly.  Hey, I got that \"h\" for you, man.  Where? it's right here.  But listen, I need you to think real hard for me first, tilly.  Now when was the last time you saw freebo? Fucker's gone, man.  Wendell said He's not coming back.  Who the fuck is wendell? You wanna see freebo, You gotta go through wendell.  Sheriff 21, this is dispatch.  Wagon is on the way.  Metro homicide.  What are we doing here At a sheriff's crime scene anyway? Excuse me, sheriff, you're blocking my light.  Whoa, jesus.  excuse me.  Sheriffs are responding To a bulletin I issued Regarding any victims with missing skin.  Excuse me.  Same m. o.  as our torture murder? Now remember, you two are just here to observe.  This is the sheriff's turf.  They're gonna investigate the scene, See what they can come up with.  What's up with him? He doesn't joke around anymore.  He dresses better.  he's polite.  Maybe someone pointed out the error in his ways.  Who called this in? neighbors.  I just got off the phone with the sheriff's department.  They've confirmed their skinning victim Is related to ours.  That gives us three victims.  They're sending someone over to look at our case files.  And we'll be establishing a joint investigation.  This is our investigation, lieutenant.  You can't expect us to just give over our files.  No one is giving over anything.  It's a matter of professional courtesy.  We're still in charge.  Now, I've had the sheriff's lab Send over all forensics.  I want both your input.  My slate's clear.  I'll talk with the medical examiner.  Another four hour erection? Anything else? I've got unis bringing in a 15 year old kid Named wendell owens.  He was freebo's doorman, which means he might be able To connect the dots between his boss And why people who knew him keep winding up dead.  I may be one of those dots.  He's a minor.  Get consent from a parent to question him.  I'll make sure everything's done by the book.  All right, I want updates on the hour.  Good work, partner.  Yeah, right.  Wendell.  I doubt this boy would recognize me From the day I met his dead boss.  But why take the chance? Dexter morgan.  Hey, dex.  Listen, I'm gonna have to cancel our lunch.  Everything all right? Rough morning, man.  Feds just informed me that they're not Gonna move forward on this cruise ship case.  Lack of evidence.  Got a witness Puts this son of a bitch on the deck With his wife just before she went missing, And he's still gonna walk.  Again! Did I mention He left his first wife's teenage daughters penniless? No need.  A whole family destroyed.  We could meet later if you want.  No, no, I'm gonna be in court, man.  How 'bout tomorrow? I may have plans.  I'll let you know.  There's due diligence to be done.  How long is this gonna take? The sooner you tell me where we can find your mom, The sooner you're outta here.  She wasn't at your house.  We can't reach her by phone.  Does she have a job? She does what she has to do.  Same as me.  You know, I was about your age when my mom died.  Suddenly, my father's raising two teenagers,by himself, So I get how hard it is for a single parent To always be there.  Yeah, I bet you had it real bad.  No, I didn't.  My dad worked really hard to get me and my brother The things he didn't have.  So I got why he wasn't always home.  But after a while, I even stopped looking for him At my softball games.  Didn't mean he didn't love me, But didn't mean it didn't hurt.  You played softball for real? First base.  But you don't look gay.  You hungry? Yeah, but not for any of that vending machine shit.  Well, I'll tell you what, If you're brave enough, there's a roach coach outside.  I'm buying.  Okay, I'll take some burgers, fries, and onion rings.  Deal.  Partner, would you keep an eye on our guest? Getting anywhere with the kid? Sorta.  You and rita set a date yet? Not yet.  Well, are you gonna move in with her first? Where's this going? Well, I kinda need to know, so I can break the lease On my place and move into yours.  What makes everybody think I'm just gonna give up my apartment? I don't know, maybe 'cause you're getting married.  Like there's room for rita and the kids at your place.  No offense, but you're the last person Who needs a fuck pad.  Dexter.  officer morgan.  Can you tell me where I might find lieutenant laguerta? Thank you so much.  Guess we know who the sheriff's department Sent to look into our files.  Big fucking mistake.  That guy's wound way too tight.  And coming from me, that's saying something.  You gonna take the fridge? Thank you.  They keep getting younger and younger, huh?  Who'd this one kill?   The boy's not a suspect.  We think he was working for freebo.  I have to say, I'm a little surprised you're who the sheriff's department Chose as their liaison.  I'm not here to make friends.  I'm here to do my job.  I've known you your entire adult life, ramon, So let's cut the bullshit.  You're using this case to insert yourself Into miami metro's investigation Of your brother's death.  If our victim can help track down My brother's killer in the process, So be it.  As one lieutenant to another, You know I could go over your head And get you pulled off this assignment.  But I'm not gonna do that.  I know you and oscar were close.  And he meant a great deal to me as well.  So you will have This department's full cooperation To a point.  If it turns out that these cases are not connected, The cooperation ends.  Entiendes? Claro.  I need to thank miguel For introducing me to a new hobby.  And for supporting an old one.  After the first wife's money ran out, Ethan didn't take long to find The next wealthy woman to woo, marry, And throw overboard.  Maybe I can return the favor on that last part.  Have both tanks delivered to the ship.  I'll need a dive skin too.  You got it.  Heading out to sea? Caribbean cruise.  Leaving tomorrow.  Do you know any good dive schools around here? Yeah.  But they all require hours for certification.  You know if I were you, I'd cut a few corners, head over to bimini.  They'll have you under the water in less than a day.  Bimini.  that's close.  I could be there and back in my boat.  The water's beautiful there.  It's my first port of call.  Maybe I could take the wife, finally get her off my back For never doing anything with her.  You'll have more fun if you don't.  I'm sure I will.  There you are.  Good news.  Wendell's mother finally answered her phone.  Patrol's bringing her upstairs now.  Yes.  Thank the baby fucking jesus.  You do know I'm catholic, right? I'm sorry, but I've had that kid At my desk all afternoon.  Hey, you ever hear the word \"bumpkus\"? I think it's \"bupkus. \"  Shit.    Yeah, hold on now.  There's this cold case I'm looking at, A dead john.  Now when you were working vice, Did you bust the same places over and over again? Um, not really.  Most guys are regulars, So word gets out quick if a place is hot.  So we'd move the decoys around.  But if you really want to know about paying for sex, You should talk to masuka.  Hey, vince, hold up.  Did you get a chance to look at The sheriff's department forensics Regarding their vic? I fucking would, if they'd fucking send them.  I've called four fucking times.  Man, somebody needs a hug.  I'd offer, but I don't know what I'd catch.  Can I go now? You know, I can take inappropriate masuka.  I can take porn loving masuka.  I can even take flatulent masuka.  But this dress shoe wearing, \"please and thank you\" zombie masuka Is fucking creeping me out.  What's going on? Maybe I'm realizing no one around here is my friend.  The only time you people even acknowledge me Is when you want something.  That's not so.  We put you on our bowling team.  Only because you wanted to keep everyone's handicap higher To sandbag the other teams.  Okay, that's true, but   Not one person read my paper.  Not one fucking person showed up at the conference I spoke at.  This is about your stupid paper? You guys just don't get it.  You hurt my feelings.  What the fuck? Where's the kid? The mother wouldn't give consent.  I had to cut him loose.  Did you explain to her how important it was That we talk to him? The moment I brought up freebo's name, she clammed up.  Word on the street is the last person Who talked to the cops about freebo wound up dead.  I spent all day Getting through to that kid.  He would have talked, or he would have Convinced his mother to let him talk.  She was never gonna cooperate.  You coulda waited until I got back.  Look, this is no reflection on the work you did here.  No, it's a reflection on how little You think of me and my work.  You think I cut this kid loose To make you look bad? I'm not sure anymore.  Partner.  Hey, baby.  You want a date? Hey, sugar.  what you look   You have got to be kidding me.  I'm not here for that, honest.  Your   You know, your   You're blushing.  I'm not.  So what, uh, what are you doing down here, sergeant? 'cause I gotta get back to work.  I came here because i   I wanted to know if   If you'd like to grab something to eat sometime.  You know, to talk.  And to eat.  I'm not interested.  I rarely date cops.  \"rarely,\" does that mean \"never\"? If I meant \"never,\" I would have said \"never. \" Dex, is that you? I'm in the kitchen.  What smells so good? It's a surprise.  Look, brochures of houses.  I know it's fast.  But syl and I spent The whole day doing drive bys, And these are the ones I fell in love with.  All of them? Well, they're in great school districts, Big yards, plenty of bedrooms, Central air.  I thought we could go through these After dinner and have syl Schedule some showings for tomorrow.  I understand that as man and wife Rita and I will have to live under the same roof.  So why is it the only word echoing in my head is No.  No? Okay, I guess we don't have to look at all of them.  No.  \"no\" doesn't really work in a relationship, dexter.  \"can we talk about it?\" is a little more productive.  I'm sorry, but I don't want to look at houses.  Not now anyway.  Fine, that's all you had to say.  Uh, if syl and I go out to look Tomorrow in the morning, Can you watch astor and cody? No, I'm going fishing tomorrow.  I'm gonna be gone all day.  And you were gonna tell me this when? Rita, this is the first I'm hearing about house hunting.  I can't just drop everything at the last minute Because you want me to.  Dinner will be ready in five minutes.  It's a roast.  Your favorite.  I double checked ethan's ship itinerary.  He's in bimini today only.  Gives me one shot to head him off at the pass.  Sorry, rita, but right now I need this More than a big yard and a two car garage.  Let me guess, syl? She might have mentioned That rita and she were going house hunting Because a certain gilipollas Decided that he'd rather go fishing.  Gilipollas? You don't wanna know.  So this is the boat you keep talking about, huh? Wow, she's a beauty.  You gonna take me out on her sometime? Sure thing.  So what brings you out here? Thought maybe we could grab some food Before you go out.  You know, kind of like a rain check for yesterday.  Ah, can't leave the boat.  Everything's onboard.  Olvidete.  okay.  Don't worry about it.  So where are they biting? Um, heading up north, mercy reef.  Always had good luck there.  You know, I got half a mind to postpone the arraignment That I have and just Go with you.  Please don't.  Nah.  I gotta be in court.  I'm gonna try to put out some fire That your lieutenant started.  But I'm glad I caught you, you know? Hey, how 'bout whatever you catch, We put on the grill tonight? Wish me luck.  Thanks for coming in early.  Lieutenant prado Wanted to get us all up to speed On the skinner case.  Thank you.  This is our vic's boyfriend.  Now, no one's seen him since the night in question.  We could use your help tracking him down.  Soderquist, ramos, you're on it.  I was also hoping I could speak with a couple Of your previous witnesses.  \"speak with\" as in we didn't do it right the first time? Cases evolve.  Witnesses change their story.  Junior personnel, they make mistakes.  No disrespect.  Actually, it's a lot of disrespect.  You've come into our house twice.  You not only insult our police work, Now you're insulting one of the most dedicated officers I've ever partnered with.  Yes, you.  It's bullshit, my man.  Let's not lose sight of the fact That we want the same thing here To find whoever is responsible for these murders.  Uh, there is one slight problem.  Your case has nothing to do with our case.  The vic wasn't skinned? Not like our previous victims.  There were minute traces of ink In the papillary and reticular   English.  Someone dug out a tattoo from the back of her neck.  Post mortem.  Which is another reason why I don't think we're looking at the same killer.  It's all right here In the county medical examiner's report.  That's your opinion.  My lab thinks differently.  let me see that.  You're not taking this seriously, are you? In a fucking heartbeat.  Do you know how many times vince masuka's been published? He's our lead forensic investigator.  And there's no one better.  Our victim was strangled, The same as yours.  Petechial hemorrhaging in the eyes and bruising Would lead one to conclude Strangulation.  Unless you're me.  You were so busy playing hide the sausage With the m. e. 's report, You were hoping I'd miss the cotton fibers In the nose and airways.  Your victim was smothered.  That's not opinion, that's science.  And science is one cold hearted bitch With a 14 inch strap on.  And he's back.  Well, I think we're through here.  I'm not so sure your lieutenant would agree, Sergeant.  Then you don't know her as well as you thought, Lieutenant.  Ethan.  Apparently ethan is looking for more Than adventure on the high seas.  Both of his deceased wives had prenups.  In a divorce, he would have been lucky to keep the rolex.  But he wanted it all.  Ethan made a choice.  And pretty soon, you're gonna have to make one too, dex.  Ethan chose to be rich Rather than married.  I, on the other hand, chose to stay with doris, Even after   You cheated on her? You think you and I are so different, don't you? I'm nothing like you.  Really? You're here and rita's back home.  You're cheating on her, And you don't even realize it.  I'll make time for my dark passenger And for rita.  It's about priorities, dexter.  You're gonna have to choose which one is your mistress And which one is your wife.  And more importantly, which one comes first.  Harry, you missed a spot.  Oh, hi, baby.  Hi, mom.  Attention all atlantic sun cruise passengers, This is bebay, your cruise director.  The next sea taxi is leaving bimini For our ship in 20 minutes.  It looked much bigger from out here.  Well, you could always knock out a wall or two.  It's easier than you think.  How 'bout the kitchen? Wall, the bay window was nice.  But those cabinets Don't get bogged down in the cosmetic stuff.  How did it feel when you were inside? Like a home.  God, you're good.  You're my friend, rita.  I wouldn't put you in something I didn't believe in.  And I believe that this home can work for you.  For your family.  What are the rules about using the bathroom In a house you're showing? No rules.  you gotta go, you gotta go.  All right.  Can I see your venture passport, sir? thank you.  Keep coming.  Excuse me, sir, Can I take a look at your venture passport? Thank you.  Ma'am, could I see your pass? Thank you.  Attention all atlantic sun cruise passengers, This is bebay, your cruise director.  The sea taxi is departing bimini For our ship in five minutes.  Also please remember that the last sea taxi Of the evening leaves the ship at 10:45 tonight.  All visitors, guests,Anyone who doesn't belong on board Must disembark at that time.  It'll be tight.  But I think both ethan turner and i Will be off the ship by that time.  Of course, only one of us will be doing so Because he wants to.  Rita? I'm bleeding.  Oh, my god.  All right, there's a hospital five blocks away.  Waiting for an ambulance is only gonna take time.  What about dexter? We'll call from the car.  Those things will kill you, you know? I'll talk to you later.  I've been by here four times looking for you.  What for? The other cop said you couldn't talk to me.  Well, he's right.  I can't.  officially.  But unofficially, There's no reason you can't call me Just in case there's something You want to tell me about your ex boss.  Burgers, fries, and onion rings.  You know, I know the situation with your mom Not being around really sucks.  But if things get really bad, You use that card and call me, okay? I kept my nose outta freebo's business.  It was safer that way.  Do you have any idea where he is? No.  I know he was into someone for some major cash.  He was pretty scared.  That's probably why he's hiding out somewhere.  Well, that explains why someone's Trying so hard to find him.  They want their money back.   So are we done?   We're done.  Oh, yeah, one other thing.  Yeah? When you find that jerk off, Tell him he still owes me three weeks' pay.  Thanks.  Watch yourself out here, okay? Okay.  Miguel, thank god you're here.  How is she? They rushed her up to prenatal i. c. u. , But they won't tell me a thing.  I'm not family.  Miss.  Hi, my name is miguel prado.  I'm an assistant district attorney.  I need you to find your chief of staff, Dr.  reynolds, and have him call this   Yeah, I'm just an admit nurse.  you're gonna have   Hey, call him.  Right now.  I feel so bad for rita.  she's all alone.  Baby, baby, reynolds is gonna make sure She gets the best care in miami.  Why isn't dexter back? I've been calling all day.  Goddamn it, the father should be here.  I enjoyed shuffling through your ipod To make sure that no one hears us.  Of course, most of your shipmates Are up on the blue deck.  It's happy hour.  just the two of us.  Oh, it's too bad I have to make this quick.  I'm usually all for a stimulating conversation At times like this.  But the last sea taxi leaves in an hour.  I've been going through some changes myself lately.  I'm getting married.  I've got a baby on the way.  me.  Even though my life may never be the same, I want to thank you for reminding me How important it is to take time for oneself.  Savor these moments alone.  And here I am.  Paradox personified.  Taking life.  Creating life.  With the ship anchored away from shore, The gulf stream will be ethan's last cruise.  Bon voyage.  This isn't like dexter.  Something's wrong.  Sweetie, I know this is difficult, But you need to stay calm.  I sent the coast guard out there to look for him.  He wasn't at his fishing spot.  So maybe he's back at the marina by now.  Then why hasn't he called? Anton, open up.  it's me.  I tried calling.  I got a lead.  I know why someone's looking for you know who.  Hurry up if you want your money.  Yes, I was wrong about   Bupkus.  Is anton here? He's in the shower.  Oh, he'll be out soon, 'cause I think we used up all the hot water.  I can get him.  Oh, no, that's all right.  Just, um, have him call debra morgan.  It's important.  Are you sure you don't want me to   Thanks.  What? Hello, debra.  this is miguel prado.  Have you heard from dexter? Uh, no.  why? Well, we're at the hospital with rita right now.  Hospital? everything all right? Debra, we need to find your brother.  Ethan turner was incapable of compromise.  He loved his wives' money more than he loved them.  And in the end, it cost him dearly.  I don't wanna be like ethan.  Maybe my days of coming and going as I please Are over.  But that doesn't mean my life is over.  Not as long as I have my boat And the open water.  There are some things I can keep to myself.  You have 12 unheard messages.  Dex, it's me.  I'm on my way to the hospital.  I think there's something wrong with the baby.  The baby? The baby's fine.  They said if I stay on bed rest The next few days That I can We can go home tomorrow.  I don't know what I would have done If I'd lost the baby and you weren't here.  And nobody could find you.  I'm here now.  And I'm not going anywhere.  I think maybe we should wait To find a house until after we're married.  Just name the date.  I'm ready.  I'd like to walk down the aisle Before I start to show.  Whatever you want.  I may never be able to feel Our baby's heartbeat emotionally.  But I know now I can't ignore it either.  And for some reason I can't explain, I'm relieved to know it's still here.  Fishing? That's where you were all night? Deb You can't make me feel any worse Than I already do.  Well, I hope this was a big wake up call for you.  'cause you're gonna be a father before you know it.  Yeah, I see that now.  My life is changing.  And if it'll make you happy, my place is yours.  What'll make me happy is you being there For that kid.  For homework And plays.  And softball games.  Don't you dare be like dad.  That's never gonna happen.  Quite a night, huh? I should have been here.  Well, syl and I were.  That's what friends are for.  I owe you one.  I just may take you up on that someday.  You know, my office got the strangest fax tonight From atlantic sun cruises.  You remember that guy that I was telling you about Whose wife disappeared on some cruise? Get this, he was reported missing About an hour ago.  Where was it that you say you went fishing? Mercy reef.  Yeah, mercy reef.  That's what I thought you said.  'cause when I sent the coast guard over there, They couldn't find you.  The ocean's a big place.  Or maybe you weren't at mercy reef.  Where else would I have been? Bimini's  What, 40 miles away? I went fishing.  you watched me leave.  You were on that cruise ship.  Do you know how crazy that sounds? You were on that cruise ship finishing what I couldn't.  Wasn't me.  You were making sure that ethan turner Could never hurt another innocent soul again.  It's getting late.  you should go.  It's okay.  Dexter, you and i, we're the same.  No one is like me.  You're wrong.  Hey, you're wrong.  Don't you see what happened today? I gave you the chance to avenge two women Whom the system failed, and just like I hoped, You seized that opportunity.  It's not like that.  Dexter You don't have to lie to me.  Don't you understand? Hey, I see who you are.  No, you can't.  No one can.  You have nothing to explain to me.  Nothing to apologize for.  Ever.  I'm with you.  I'm behind you.  And I respect you.  I better get home.  Syl will be waiting up.  Good night, dexter.  When harry saw what I truly was, He was repulsed.  It destroyed my brother, Consumed lila.  But not miguel prado.

        "script": "Previously on dexter I just got off the phone with the sheriff's department.  They've confirmed their skinning victim is related to ours.  That gives us three victims.  I've got unis bringing in a 15 year old kid named wendell owens.  He was freebo's doorman.  If things get really bad, you use that card and call me, okay? You think I cut this kid loose to make you look bad? I'm not sure anymore Partner.  You know a joey quinn? Cooperation with i. a.  has its upside.  Yuki, that's not gonna happen.  Ramon's obsessed.  He's not going to stop looking for oscar's Killer until it takes him all the way down.   Is there a problem here?   Yeah, sergeant.  Your people don't know what the fuck they're doing.  Where ya been, dexter? How are you, camilla? Ah.  I've been better.  Are you, uh, looking for anything special tonight? Might be more than an hour.  Take a pass Sergeant.  Anton, open up.  it's me.  Hi.  Hi.  The chicky hines conviction.  My people have come across evidence that could get the case reopened.  Prado know you're coming to me with this? Don't you see what happened today? I gave you the chance to avenge two women whom the system failed, And just like I hoped, you seized that opportunity.  I see who you are.  I am with you.  Behind you.  I respect you.  He's tired.  keep on reeling.  You got him.  Here he comes! come here! Come here! Oh, yeah! Oh, shit! Ah, ah.  Ahah! Go ahead.  That's gonna be some mighty fine eatin'.  Hey, man, on the grill with syl's mango and lime salsa.  Our house tomorrow night.  Check with the little woman Who's getting bigger as we speak.  I could get used to the simple joys of male bonding.  Hey, how 'bout a brewski? Okay.  Ah, that looks good.  So dex Ahh.  What was it like, man? In bimini.  Flat, mostly.  lots of mangroves.  Talking about ethan turner.  What about him? What did it feel like to, uh Take him out, hmm? To end his life.  So much for the simple joys of male bonding.  Like I could explain or miguel could understand.  You put people on death row.  You must know what it's like.  Oh, no, But there's like an ocean of bureaucracy of briefs and Appeals between me and that bad guy taking his last breath.  I'm asking you what did it feel like to use your hands, to To make this a better place? It feltright.  Felt like justice.  I've got, like, Five floors of prosecutors and the whole police Department at my fingertips, and you did what I couldn't.  You came through for me, dex.  I been sleepin' like a baby ever since.  It was hot today, huh? Like I said the other night, I know you, dexter.  I see who you are.  We're like minded.  hmm? Together, we can make a difference.  We? Miguel, my amigo, claims to know me.  On some level, I suppose maybe that's true.  Who are you kidding? He knows about freebo.  He detailed me to the ethan turner kill.  He's seen me with blood on my hands and hasn't blinked.  Miguel's got no clue what's really going on inside you.  The urge, the ritual.  Miguel has really gone out of his way to understand who I am Which is more than you ever did.  Well, I understood.  I just couldn't accept it.  And miguel won't either.  You didn't want me to have any friends.  You think miguel's a pal? Your wingman? You might wanna put that notion to the test See how like minded you and miguel really are.  Every time you let someone get close, it ends badly.  I do need to consider my spotty record connecting with others.  But miguel's not going away.  I need to make him understand the risks.  When he does, he'll wanna rethink the like minded thing.  Just because he can gut a fish Doesn't qualify him to hang with me while i Do what I do best.  You need a jump? I have cables.  Skinner struck again.  Super hard this time.  The victim's name was wendell owen.  He was 15 years old.  It's more collateral damage in our search for fucking freebo.  Wendell owens? I brought him in for questioning the other day.  I thought I remembered hearing his name somewhere.  He might have been mixed up with some lowlifes, But wendell was a pretty decent kid.  Go do your thing.  I just need a minute.  Body's still warm.  Putting time of death about three hours ago.  Unlike the two previous victims, This one died from the skinning process itself.  Jesus christ.  Freebo's probably in another galaxy, and the skinner doesn't even know it.  Meanwhile, he's stepping up his game.  Maybe we let the press know freebo got outta dodge, Might get this guy to put down his ginzu knife.  Or he'll keep looking, take his horror show on the road, Become somebody else's nightmare.  No, I wanna nail whoever's doing this.  He's definitely not learning to do this on the fly.  He's had plenty of practice.  You run this through the national database, see if a similar m. o.  Comes up anywhere else.  What I need to find right now is a target to present To miguel with a high degree of difficulty and jeopardy.  So that he truly understands that he's in way over his head.  Dex.  I have a question.  It's serious.  I can't ask any of the other cops.  I'm all yours.  It's about the skinner.  His last two victims, Wendell and javier, They were both killed after I was done questioning them.  Do you think the skinner's Drafting off my investigation? I don't know.  anything's possible.  Because I'm freaking out That whoever's looking for freebo Is using me to attract him.  Who else knows you brought wendell in? His mom, um All the cops in the station.  Anton.  ramon prado.  Miguel's brother.  The law and order hard ass sheriff Who's been obsessed about finding freebo For killing his little brother.  There's your motive.  Do we seriously think that ramon, a fellow cop, Could do something this sick? Like a career in law enforcement Precludes violent behavior? Can you imagine the shit storm this is gonna create If I'm wrong? It'll create a worse shit storm if you're right.  Hey, keep me in the loop.  Yeah.  Ramon's got anger issues.  I don't want you getting hurt.  Aw.  you do care about me.  Wait till you see the wine cellar at the forge.  It is legendary! They even have a bottle Of chateau d'yquem belonged to thomas jefferson.  I'm kind of a cuba libre kinda girl myself.  Ellen, it's me.  nicely done.  Handing miguel prado his head on a pike today   Make the hines motion stick, he could be disbarred.  Bravissimo.  I was gonna talk to you about this, If and when my motion's upheld.  How 'bout we talk about it now? Okay.  Miguel's been playing fast and loose for a long time With legal ethics.  The chicky hines case is just one example On a very long list of prosecutorial misconduct.  I came to you with information to help your client, Not for you to trump up some witch hunt Against my friend and colleague.  You can't possibly believe he's either of those things If you really knew miguel Believe me, I know miguel.  I will explain everything over dinner.  No, thanks.  I'm not feeling especially social right now.  I hope I'm not interrupting.  No, I'm alone.  come on in.  Taking the night off? So, umbeer? Sure.  Pot? Fuck you.  Sounded kind of upset on the phone.  I'm kind of upset in person too.  You didn't talk to anyone About me bringing wendell in for questioning? No.  I don't talk to anybody about anything.  I try to keep the whole c. i.  thing under wraps, you know? Then how the hell did it get out? Well, it's a pretty safe bet wendell didn't tell anybody.  You should have seen what this sicko did to him.  I'm glad I didn't.  What would make anyone go that hard On some street kid, for christ's sakes? There's this guy I'm lookin' at He's a cop who had a beef with freebo.  He saw me in the station when I was questioning wendell.  Wouldn't be the first time the boys in blue Handled their own business, right? I can't rule out that I put wendell in the crosshairs.  He trusted me enough to cooperate, and Look what happened to him.  Hey, look Even if you're right, You couldn't have known, right? Don't beat yourself up.  It's what I do best, huh? I should go.  All right.  Hey, um Hey, look, um That girl from the other night was Was nothing serious.  Uh, wellit's none of my business anyway.  Yeah, right.  Jenna kendrick.  One of the first crime scenes I worked blood spatter.  This is somebody's daughter.  And that was done to her by this animal.  Clemson galt.  Aryan affiliated.  Took a claw hammer to her for getting pregnant.  He was arrested for murder, Even confessed to his cellmate.  He called it \"hammer time. \" They get a conviction? Galt's aryan affiliates either got witnesses to recant Or made them disappear.  Verdict came back not guilty.  That  that type of stuff happens way too often.  Galt's doing 15 to 20 for armed robbery In a supermax upstate.  Well, that's something, at least.  Get him off the streets.  Only he's still running things from his prison cell.  The wife and three kids of an aryan defector, Killed with a claw hammer.  While you're sleeping like a baby, This is who's keeping me up nights.  Justice comes at a price, One that miguel is about to discover he can't afford.  This asshole doesn't deserve to breathe, okay? You're not gonna get any argument with me about that.  But he's in custody.  In a supermax, no less.  That's always been the problem.  You're the big deal law enforcement guy.  I bet you could get us access.  That  that's beyond dangerous, dexter.  That's crazy! I knew if I appealed to reason, Miguel would eventually understand the downside.  Ne never mind that my fingerprints Will be all over this! Reason leads to self preservation, A potent force.  We both would be seriously exposed here.  I just need to sit back.  He'll see the pros are heavily outweighed by the cons, And we'll be back to mojitos and barbecues.  Yeah, when you get right down to it, I guess ethan turner was an accident of opportunity, A once in a lifetime thing.  What about freebo? Another accident of opportunity? Well, that situation just sort ofunfolded.  You're right.  We both have too much to lose.  Hey, we took out the garbagetwice.  We should quit while we're ahead.  No.  I owe you this one, dexter.  You stuck your neck out for me twice now.   No, you don't owe me     Fair is fair.  And I won't let you down.  But we need to come up with a real plan.  Againwe.  Miguel surprised me last night.  I expected him to say no and he gave me a definite maybe instead.  No doughnuts today? Not today, vince.  Talk about your passive aggressive.  Clemson galt has been on my top ten list for years, And miguel could be a big help.  But the goal here isn't to satisfy my need.  It's to get miguel to find some other hobby.  Dexter.  got a minute? Who's sick? Uh, remember camilla from records? She's in the hospital.  It's not looking good, so I got everyone to sign.  Camilla's sick? Sorry, I thought you knew.  Lung cancer.  it's terminal.  Just like gene.  Camilla's husband.  My folks used to play cards with them when deb and I were growing up.  He died just last year.  lung cancer too.  Smokers? Ah, chimneys.  Life catches up.  Yeah.  So does death.  It's a shame.  she's a good person.  It sounds like she was a friend.  A good friend.  Those are in short supply these days.  Camilla's at good samaritan.  You could drop that off, let her know she's in our prayers.  I'll do that.  Thanks.  Detective gianna, sergeant batista, miami metro homicide.  How can I help you, sergeant? I was, uh, wondering, detective Maybe we could See each other.  As  as in aa date? Well, yeah.  You could call it that.  Look, um, sergeant, let  let's be clear.  'cause being clear will save us both a lot of agita.  Hey! I, uh I don't date.  ever.  Do you eatever? Sometimes.  Good nutrition's important.  I'll tell you what, sergeant.  I get hungry enough, I will call you.  Angel? What? Can I throw something at you that might sound a little crazy? Crazy? from you?  Ramon prado.    What about him? Do we like him for the skinner? Okay, that's not a little crazy.  He has access to all of our records, So he knows exactly who I've been talking to.  And we've all seen him up close   this is not a stable guy.  He's a fucking whack job.  I looked into his work schedule.  He was off duty when the last two murders went down.  You seriously wanna look at ramon prado for multiple homicide? If only to rule him out.  Not only have we not found the perp that killed miguel prado's Little brother, now you wanna investigate his other brother for murder? In a nutshell.  Can't ignore something just 'cause it's messy.  If I'm right, this is huge.  And if you're wrong, Everyone involved will be shitting Blood due to acts I'd rather not describe.  Thanks for that, sarge.  I've got a gut feeling.  You, uh, wanna go to the lieutenant with this? I can't go to laguerta with this.  You follow up Off the grid, and it's on you.  Thank you, sarge.  Ramon's off duty tonight and tomorrow.  I'll set up on him, I'll see what shakes loose.  If you need company I've got it covered.  And try to be discreet, will you? For a change? Yeah.  Dexter.  You came.  I also brought you these.  But it looks like somebody beat me to it.  That new mom in maternity donated them to terminal care.  Talk about irony, huh? You know, dexter, my whole life I've been searching for The meaning of life? The perfect Key lime pie.  And what do I get when I'm about to croak? Fucking pie crust, reddi wip, and green jell o.  I'll see what I can do about finding you the perfect key lime pie.  You'd better do it fast.  Next thing to go is the appetite.  Gene always had this thing about lighting my cigarette.  And he'd pass it to me Before he lit his own.  Sweet, sweet man.  Then it all caught up to him.  I watched him wither to a skeleton.  My 6' tall, 200 pound husband, shitting all over himself.  His last breath was a mercy.  Dying I can do.  Hell, I'm doing it.  The pain sure is a bear, though.  How bad? The worst part of the whole damn thing Not losing my life My time on this earth Is losing mymy Dignity.  That fish was great.  You don't think miguel overcooked it? A bit, but the mango salsa saved the day.  Thank you.  So do you like what you do? I mean, real estate.  I can't imagine doing anything else.  I decided that losing my job at the Motel is not a bad thing but a good thing.  So I'm looking around.  Well, with your people skills, you'd be great at real estate.  You think? How 'bout you start work tomorrow? I'mi'm sorry, what? I need an assistant.  Having someone I can trust is everything.  Salud.  Listen, I've been giving a lot of thought to this clemson galt thing.  Good.  Digame.  What if we were to travel upstate and arrange an interview with him? About? A career criminal with a record like his, He's gotta be an encyclopedia of intel on tons of other cases.  We would just need to get galt alone long enough To make it look like another prisoner did the deed.  Last week, An inmate is found in a prison hallway drowned in a bucket of water.  This stuff happens all day long in places like that.  An inmate is found dead in custody, dexter, Be a lot of inquiries and investigations.  You got the bleeding hearts comin' outta The woodwork whining about prison reform.  Ha.  it doesn't sound like much of a plan.  That is the plan So that miguel finally includes himself out.  But, um I'm in the middle of trying a racketeering case right now.  Money laundering.  The aryans, they're masters at moving cash around.  I subpoena galt as an expert witness, Corrections transports him down here to testify.  Then galt is within our reach, hmm? And on my turf.  Guessing it would take a long time to set something like that up.  It would.  But I've already issued the subpoena.  Galt'll be here tomorrow night.  Onlyhe's gonna be a no show on the witness stand the next morning.  Swing by the courthouse tomorrow, I'll walk you through all the details.  say thank you, dexter.  Miguel seems to have way more aptitude And appetite for this than I ever imagined.  Just calling to check in.  Just having a look see in ramon prado's car.   Deb, you really need to     relax.  He's scarfing down his second plate of Arroz con pollo at a restaurant up the block.  He's got a wife and kids at home, got the night off, So why is he eating alone? Well, maybe the wife's arroz con pollo isn't pollo enough.  You find anything interesting? A set of german steel filet knives, a couple of straight razors, And like 12 pounds of human skin.  Just be careful out there, will you? Yes, sir.  Deb's got her mission.  I've got mine.  Hey, I can get out and give you a great, Big hug so everyone can see what good friends we are Or you can talk to me.  You know, after 12 hours on surveillance detail, How 'bout you blow me instead? I've been given the directive to either Step up my investigation of quinn or close it.  Because you haven't found dick.  If you weren't such a fuckwad, I'd almost feel sorry for you for working for i. a.  Where careers go to die.  You need to get next to quinn, be his go to girl.  You'll be wearing a wire.  Are you on crack? How many times have I told you to eat shit? What the fuck makes you think I'm suddenly willing to play now? Because if you don't, I'll put the word out that you've been cooperating all along.  Everyone'll think you're a rat anyway.  Hard to believe even you would sink that low.  So that door right over there? hmm.  Check this out.  That's supposed to be kept locked, and it never is.  The smokers use it as a shortcut to get outside.  Shortcut to a shorter life.  You know, statistically, most escapes happen out of a courthouse.  The security's a little bit more lax, The defendant is wearing a suit and a tie.  It makes it easy for him to just walk away.  Easier for us to cover our tracks.  That too.  must be good to be you.  Sometimes.  Real reason she's blindfolded   so she doesn't have to watch Everything she stands for get pissed on by someone like ellen wolf.  You know, She had this client once who threw a Five year old into an industrial washer for talking dirty.  She got him off with six months in a mental hospital.  Diminished fucking capacity.  Hey.  She probably got paid more that than you took home in a year.  And I gotta tell you, I'm very disappointed with your boss over there.  I never thought that she, of all people, Would hurt me like this and throw in with these fucking bottom feeders.  My dad used to say be careful what you think you know about someone.  You're probably wrong.  Smart man.  Well, sometimes.  Maria! I appreciate your, um, cooperation in the deposition.  I've never had a problem telling the truth.  We've got, uh, more than enough to get the hines conviction set aside.  And you've set the stage for your smear campaign against a stand up guy.  Nice.  You know, you ever wanna hear the unexpurgated version of your guy, Come find me, okay? Looks like a church.  Yeah.  The holding cell is through that door.  Connects to a hallway, then goes out to a parking garage.  On your right, there's gonna be an emergency exit.  And that deadbolt is gonna be taped Open.  Why risk it all? Your career, reputation, freedom.  You could just walk away.  You didn't walk away from ethan turner.  Because you understand, dexter, that we're living in We're living in crucial times, Crucial times that demand extraordinary measures.  Miguel's convinced himself he wants this Kill tonight for lofty and noble reasons.  I'm not quite as high minded.  You didn't answer my question.  Asshole drunk dad Maybe I'm still trying to clean up the mess That I couldn't when I was a kid, I don't know.  Come on, I'll, uh, show you where you're gonna be hooking up with galt.  Morgan, what's the hurry? You meeting someone? More like avoiding someone.  Hey, this is me not telling you I'm tailing ramon prado again tonight.  Well, this is me not hearing a word you're saying.  I'm also unofficially and off the record Telling you to be smart and watch your ass.  'scuse me, officer.  Sergeant.  how can I help you? I was just, uh, released for this legal thing.  You were arrested.  And released.  totally victimless.  Only I live like a million miles away from here, and I really need a ride.  How 'bout the bus? How 'bout you take me home and I think Of some victimless way of saying thank you? I'll have dispatch call you a cab.  Just like that? Just like that.  Agent batista.  Sergeant, barbara gianna here.  So happens, uhI'm hungry.  Hungry enough to   to see if you are too.  Are you asking me out on a date, detective? I don't date, sergeant.  ever.  Marino's trattoria, 7:30? Aren't you gonna ask me if I really turned over a new leaf? It could be I'm just not partial to redheads.  I have no idea what you're talking about, detective.  I'll see you at 7:30.  Delivered fresh daily from a little bakery down in key largo.  Supposed to be the best in the keys.  Well, it's not.  Pardon my bluntness, but This pie is green.  Means they used food coloring.  Something purists frown on? Which I'd be doing right now, except even my face hurts.  The other thing they fucked up   this wasn't made with condensed milk.  No, it's fresh and organic.  Only they didn't have fresh milk in the keys back in the day.  Here comes miss morphy.  Bringer of bad dreams and less pain.  Dexter If you're as serious about key lime pie as I am You can do better.  Tonight's the night.  but it feels different.  I won't be alone.  Uncharted territory for me not without risk.  And strangely exhilarating.  So what do you think? Best pizza night ever.  No, I meant about syl's job offer.  If real estate's something you're interested in, I think you should go for it.  And syl's great at what she does.  In a market this bad, she's still always closing.  And I could learn a lot.  I just But Well, what if i See a side to her that I don't like? I guess that's the risk you run when you go into business with somebody, Especially a friend.  Makes things more complicated, no doubt about it.  Still Without my friend syl, I wouldn't have this opportunity.  So I think I'm gonna take the risk and jump in With both feet and see if this new thing calls to me.  It's getting late.  You don't wanna stay? Miguel and I have a early morning run.  I can sleep in longer if I stay at my place.  Don't be surprised if he's a no show.  What makes you say that? He's been a complete wreck lately.  Not sleeping, terrible mood.  I mean, syl thinks something's really bothering him.  I saw him today.  he seemed fine.  Well, you may be his buddy, but you're not his wife.  And besides, it's not like you can hide anything from your partner.  So true.  Why would you want to? Looks like miguel's got a bad case of nerves about tonight.  He isn't sleeping like a baby anymore.  If you're gonna bail of of this, now would be a good time.  What the hell are you dressed like that for? I figured the more the merrier.  Why don't we swing by and pick up rita and the kids? Bring them along too.  What makes you think you can count on miguel? He's just a little jumpy.  he's new at this.  Mark my words, dex, he'll give you up in a heartbeat to save his own ass.  This is not a guy who wants to spend the rest of his life in a cage.  Just one more thing miguel and I have in common.  You don't know what you're getting into.  You've never had to rely on anyone else before, dexter.  Because you taught me loneliness as an art form.  But guess what? I finally have a life with a family and now a friend Who I trust.  We only see two things in people What we wanna see and what they wanna show us.  You don't know miguel any more than he knows you.  You aren't seriously gonna lecture me on Relationships after the debris field you left behind.  No matter how close two people are, an infinite distance separates them.  Look at you and me.  Mind if I get a picture with you, jefe? You got a cam  oh.  Oh, yeah.  No problema.  Gracias.  Any truth you're gonna run for d. a. ? Uhif I do, I'm gonna need your support.  You got it, jefe.  Thanks, officer.  You listen to me, pulled pork.  I got no clue why the fuck you dragged me down here in all this humiliation, But you can suck my white dick, You think I'm helping your spic ass with shit.  This all ends right here, right now, clemson.  This makes us even.  When you walk out the door, One of your nazi pals is waiting for you in the parking garage.  From now on, all of the threats to my family, they stop, understand? I knew my aryan brothers would come through, ese.  Thanks.  Have any arrangements been made in case this guy's Testimony runs a little long and he has to stay another day? We're holding a spot for him in protective at miami dade.  My good man.  appreciate it.  I got a witness in there, man, he's taking a nap.  I'm gonna really need him fresh for court in a couple of hours.  I gotta put a county wristband on him.  Just take a second.  Clem galt\u00a3\u00acI'm your wheel man.  Welcome home.  Heil hitler.  Let's get the fuck outta here.  ride's this way.  Have ya outta the country by lunchtime.  Fuck! Shit! what's going on here? I don't know.  come on.  I'll get ya outta here.  We just gotta get to the car.  Galt had to have an accomplice.  Just set up a perimeter around this building right away.  No one should get in or out.  Fuckin' spic set us up.  This guy cannot get away! And I'm gonna return the favor.  That's mighty white of you.  Galt's right.  he's selling you out.  Never underestimate the capacity of other people to let you down.  It's not the time, dad.  There he goes.  Looking out for number one.  Which is what you should have done.  Like the man said, nobody gets in or out.  Might as well give up.  No sense risking death by cop.  You keep miguel's involvement secret, He might let you off with a few years.  Stop.  Unless they find those blood slides when they toss your apartment.  Stop! Hola, amigo.  I'm gonna drop you off at your car.  Then I'll meet you at the stash house as soon as I can get outta here.   Wait for me, huh?   Thanks for this.  That's what friends are for.  Hey, I'm gonna do a loop around the building until you get more backup here, Okay? You got it, jefe.  Gimme a fucking break, ramon.  Don't fucking lie to me You can make this stop right now If you tell me where he is.  I don't know.  You're making this very hard on yourself, felipe.  Whoa! You scared the fuckmother out of me.  You're the one that called me.  What do we got? Kidnapping, for starters.  Who's the special guest? That's felipe cepeda.  He's one of freebo's hemp suppliers.  I questioned him a couple of weeks ago.  Now ramon's got a few questions of his own.  Well, so far, I've only heard one   where's freebo? I'm just waiting for the skinning to start.  Oye.  Tell me where he is.  I don't know! Okay.  Okay.  Nothing like a nice cold soda pop before a good skinning.  Aah! Fuck, that's gotta hurt.   Wait, wait.    Wait? We need to be sure he's the skinner.  Felipe You have some answers for me now? I don't get it.  I don't get it.  That's not the skinner's m. o.  Maybe he's just warming up.  Here he goes Vete.  He's not the skinner.  I gotta take this.  don't go anywhere.  Hello.  So ramon prado's a sick fuck, But he's not the sick fuck we're looking for.  I'll talk to you about it over breakfast.  I gotta go.  What's up? So, why are you calling us in at midnight? We've picked up ramon prado.  He's, uhoutside.  We got a uni watching him to keep his mouth shut.  For what? Kidnapping.  False imprisonment.  And torture.  Are you sure? We witnessed it ourselves.   My god, i     We can't give him a pass on this.  Ishit.  No, we can't.  Thank you for being politic at least.  I woulda perp walked him right through here.  Morgan insisted we be discreet out of respect for his family.  Were you aware of this investigation? Yes, I was.  And you didn't inform me? I wanted something solid before involving you.  Thank you for that.  Morgan, you handled a tough situation the smart way.  How do you wanna do this? Book him.  I'll notify the family.  That went well.  Internal affairs is investigating you.  What? They've been giving me a sandpaper enema to wear a fucking wire.   This has been goin' on for a while.    Yes.   And you're finally telling me.    I'm finally telling you.  Do you wanna tell me why this i. a.  chick is so gung ho to bring you down? Wait.  does this i. a.  chick go by the name of yuki amado? As a matter of fact, yes.  You wanna tell me what's going on? Yeah.  yuki and I have ahistory.  It's a totally personal vendetta on her part.  I'll handle it.  I appreciate the heads up, though.  Even in prison, I'm sure you heard about the big slump in the real estate market.  What the fuck Shit! There is an upside to the downturn, though.  Plenty of empty houses.  Do you recognize this one? It's where you killed jenna kendrick.  I got no idea what the hell you're talking about.  I'm talking about hammer time, clemson.  No.  You got me mixed up with somebody else.  You can't imagine how much I've been looking forward to this.  And none of it would be happening if it weren't for my Friend miguel prado.  You remember him? He really came through tonight.  In a big way.  I never had a partner before.  I had my doubts initially, but everything worked out.  But this part, the ritual The connection and certainty Followed by that pristine silence Is for me.  And me alone.  Miguel will be disappointed.  I'll explain to him I took galt straight to the cemetery And dumped him in a grave after the screw up at the courthouse.  Truth is, I'm not ready to share this part of me with anyone else just yet.  Present company excepted.  I'm not sure I ever will be ready.  Even if miguel senses my deception, He'll forgive me this one small untruth.  Dexter.  How can I be so sure? Because after tonight, I can honestly say I know who miguel prado really is My first good friend.  And those are in short supply these days.      Previous EpisodeNext Episode"

You ever have those dreams where you're exposed? All the time.  I show up at school bottomless.  Body parts out in the open.  Exactly.  It's an anxiety dream.  It's probably about the wedding.  That must be it.  It's a stressful time.  But, hey, we got each other, right? Except I'm not stressed.  Not about miguel.  He hasn't seen what harry saw, But so far he hasn't turned away from my truth.  He's embraced it.  There's so much to do to pull off this wedding Before the baby starts showing.  I'm good at taking directions.  Good, because I need your guest list.  And your head count so we can pick a venue And give a budget to the caterer.  Well, there's deb and, uh Deb, that's it.  That's my list.  That's it? What about your friends? Angel, vince? Miguel.  He's a friend.  See, you're on a roll.  Just make sure you get names, addresses, Spouses and plus ones.  Okay.

Well, I know you two were close.  Just give her my best.  Mm hmm.  Those closest to me have always resided in a box of slides Until now.  Ooh, how about we pop some wheelies, boys? After all, it is the last ride of my life.  You'll be around a long time, camilla.  Sure as hell better not be.  You need anything else you just let me know.  Okay.  This  this is the room, dexter.  The room I'm gonna die in.  Sooner the better.  Well, it's nice.  It's got wallpaper.  That shoebox there.  Get it for me, will you? I thought you might like to have those.  She loved taking pictures.  Documented every bridge game we played With harry and doris.  Drove me batty with that camera.  But it's nice seeing these now.  Dexter, the awkward years.  And now look at you.  Engaged.  Baby on the way.  I'd love to meet rita.  We'll make that happen.  And that envelope there? Those are my funeral plans.  I thought I was organized.  Simple catholic service.  Nothing fancy.  It's all arranged.  What family I have left lived up north.  If you wouldn't mind calling the funeral director When the time comes.  They'll take care of everything.  Sure, okay.  Isn't this a bit   What, morbid? Death will be mercy, dexter.  No more pain, no more chemo.  Justpeace.  And the best part? I'll get to see gene.  I gotta get to work but I'll be back later, okay? Don't forget.  You promised to find me The perfect key lime pie.  Better move fast.  Where can I get a good key lime pie? You can't.  They all taste like sour dog shit.  It's camilla's favorite.  How's she doing? She doesn't have much time left.  You should go visit her.  I don't do sick people.  I can't.  Reminds me too much of mom.  What's miguel prado doing here? He is pulling his brother ramon out of some deep doody.  We bust him for kidnap and torture And he's just gonna walk right outta here.  Fucker's lucky he's got an a. d. a.  in the family.  It was an off the grid investigation.  Is that what you call, \"false imprisonment\"? I'm not gonna get railroaded for doing your department's job.  Ramon, if you don't take this offer You're looking at jail time here, okay? The prick isn't even pressing charges, miguel.  My detectives will! Unless they know you're not walking around With a badge and a gun.  What, I give you my shield and then what? Tell me what the hell am I supposed to do? Get some help! Hermano.  You don't have a lot of options here, okay? It's early retirement with benefits.  Union won't be able to do better.  Listen to your p. b. a.  rep, will you? And keep the prado name out of the papers, right? You really wanna put sara and the kids through all that? I'll deliver these to his captain, start the paperwork.  Appreciate the consideration, lieutenant.  Yeah, okay.  This really would have been bad for me.  On top of the ellen wolf accusations, The chicky hines case   Chicky hines wasn't personal, miguel.  Yeah.  Helping ramon, That was personal.  Thank you.  Tense in there.  A lot tenser in here.  I gotta blow off some steam.  After work, you and me, we're gonna go hit something Hard.  We are? At the driving range.  Golf, right.  Yeah, I'll meet you there.  So what, you and the a. d. a. , you're pals now? Yeah, we are.  Kiss ass.  Another crack like that and you're off the list.  Family and friends I see these people everyday but if they really knew me They'd hardly call me friend.  Miguel might be the exception.  So when I say the skinner is a top priority, I expect progress.  Understood? Now where are we on the national database? We ran it.  nothing came back.  Got a call into interpol too.  Should I invite quinn? He's so tan.  First, someone loaned freebo some money.  And is willing to skin people to get it back.  That same someone is drafting off our investigation.  We are being watched.  Which is why I wanna use Our c. i.  more aggressively.  Wait, you mean anton? Yeah, we're gonna spread the word That anton knows where freebo is.  You're gonna use him as bait? Ramos, soderquist, I wanna put anton Under surveillance immediately.  That's his name.  Soderquist You're gonna tell him, right? All due respect, sarge.  We tell him, he bolts.  Two of my witnesses have turned up dead.  You wanna see a third? Anton's already got a target on his back By helping us.  This will protect him.  Yeah, right.  Okay, look.  I'm gonna keep anton in the dock For now but I want eyes on him at all times.  Understand? Hey, deb? What? Are you gonna bring a date to the wedding? I don't know, dex.  I might be too busy picking up pieces Of anton's skin to even be there.  So you're a \"maybe\"? Morgan.  Her.  Wendell owens's mom called.  Sounds like she has something on his murder.  I'll drive.  Do not invite quinn.  No quinn.  Yo, morgan.  Him.  Grab your kit, buddy.  We got a crime scene.  Fucking mess.  City pays for the tree trimming but not the clean up.  We all can't live in high class neighborhoods, morgan.  Yeah, I'm sure you live in a real dump, mr.  cadillac.  Ms.  owens, I understand you have Some new information about your son's murder? Yes, I do.  I found this.  That's my card.  It was in wendell's shorts.  The ones he was wearing that night.  The ones he got killed in.  I am so sorry for your loss.  You stay the hell away from me! I didn't mean to   you didn't mean to what? You came to my house.  You talked to my son and I told you not to.  Gotta go back inside.  You led that animal here.  Right here to my only baby.  And now he's gone.  Wendell is gone because of you! He's gone! Marriage, children.  You never expect it to end in tragedy.  Unless you're me.  I want all civilians cleared off the street.  We're gonna be rolling out a body.  Lisa morton.  College valedictorian on her way to harvard business school.  Found the murder weapon.  Under the sofa.  Screwdriver's consistent with the wound.  The perp must have used it to jimmy the front window.  I figured the girl heard it, Came down to check it out.  Took a swing at the perp, missed, knocked over the lamp.  The perp freaked, stabbed her, ran.  Apparently without shoes.  These are sock prints.  Sock? Yeah, looks like he cut himself.  Or stepped on the victim's blood? No, if it was hers The prints would become less saturated as he ran away And got back to the window.  But they're more saturated, see? Blood belongs to our guy.  Fucking socks? Run it through the criminal database.  See if anything gets kicked back.  I'll bet you a night of lap dances I already know who did it.  Albert chung.  Got arrested six months ago on a b&e.  Knocked an old lady down some stairs And he did it all in his socks.  Same old lady, identifies the wrong guy in the lineup.  Shoeless schmoe walked.  How do you remember that? Wasn't even a homicide.  Chung is asian, bro.  He makes us all look bad.  And taking off your shoes? Can anyone get more cliche.  Well, he probably did it to keep quiet Or to not leave shoeprints.  So he leaves \"softprints\".  Freaking moron.  And asians are supposed to be smart.  Fucking albert chung.  Fucking albert chung.  Fucking albert chung.  First, an old lady, now a college valedictorian.  Well, we've matched his dna to the blood at the crime scene.  Mug shots on every media outlet.  Someone will turn him in.  First I got ramon drinking himself into a stupor.  Then I got syl nagging me for attention.  And I got scumbags like albert chung running free.  Well, the department's working on that last one.  And what if they do catch him, eh? Then what? His attorney got him off once.  I'll lay you odds that chung walks again.  No.  You and i We should take care of this ourselves.  There's a lotta wrong in the world, dex.  Just ask lisa morton's parents.  Slice.  I guess it can't hurt to keep tabs on chung If the police can't bring him in on their own.  Hell, let them have albert chung.  He's just the symptom.  We need to go after the root cause.  The one responsible for putting him on the streets.  His blood sucking, soulless, defense attorney, Ellen wolf! She got her client off.  Isn't that her job? Her job is to uphold the law.  But ellen wolf, she twists and bends the law Until it's unrecognizable.  Has she, uh Ever actually killed anyone? Chung wasn't the first evil fuck That she put back on the streets.  The body count is piling up! If she hasn't done the deed with her own hands.  Dexter, you're being too literal.  I don't think I am.  Do me a favor, okay? Keep an open mind about her.  Let me show you some files.  No pressure.  Just research.  Move your back foot to the left.  Ellen wolf doesn't fit my usual code.  But in the interest of friendship I said I'd keep an open mind.  Camilla's request for the perfect key lime pie Is much less complicated.  I'm not eating this crap.  Get it out of here.  Get it out of my room.  All right, honey, it's gone.  Don't you worry.  She's having a hard day.  Got some news.  Bad news, huh? Tumors worse? No.  It's slowing, goddamnit.  Doctors gave me another month.  Another month of struggling to breathe, Of shitting myself, Of this stupid, fucking wallpaper.  I'm I'm sorry.  I already lived through this with gene.  The end stage.  All I want is to be on the other side of it.  He at least had me.  And you have me.  I'll bring you as many key lime pies as you can stand.  Gene wanted me to end his life, you know? I would have done it if I could have.  It is kind of illegal.  It's more than illegal.  It's a mortal sin to us catholics.  One way ticket to hell.  I can't take my own life either.  But You're not catholic.  No.  I'm definitely not catholic.  But I do live by a certain code.  Of course you do.  Harrytaught you right.  So what I'm about to ask you is The most terrible thing anyone could   Camilla I don't   Justhelp me.  Please.  You're strong.  And a good friend.  No, don't   don't answer now.  Just think about it.  She couldn't have asked a better person.  Taking lives is what I do.  But never someone innocent and certainly not a friend.  Get in.  What's so important you had to see me At the ass crack of dawn? Do you have any out of town relatives? Why, you wanna take a vacation together? Okay.  What's going on? I heard a rumor about you.  That you know where freebo is.  You know that I don't.  I'm just telling you what I heard.  And the other cops heard it too.  Which means that the skinner will be looking for me? Shit.  This shit is crazy.  I've got nothing to do with freebo Except for helping you and no one knows about that Except for the cops.  Wait, are you telling   Am I being set up? Jesus.  And here you are asking me about out of town relatives.  Everybody's got one.  so you want me to go? I want you to survive.  I don't wanna lose a good c. i.  Listen, you telling me Me leaving It's not gonna help you any.  I'll find another lead.  So I guess I should go.  Good.  You watch that mouth of yours.  Fuck you.  The code has always been my guide.  Why should this be different? Taking an innocent life Could be a dangerous precedent.  I can't just change the rules for a friend.  Or maybe I don't want to.  But I can honor miguel's request to research ellen wolf.  Keep an open mind.  Murderers, rapists, car jackers set free To commit more heinous crimes.  Maybe my code could include the person Who unleashed them on the world.  Hey, you.  Hey, did you get my messages? The list.  you need my list.  A. s. a. p.  Working on it right now.  Thank you, dexter.  We still don't have a head count, So I can't start looking for a venue.  It'll all get done, I promise.  Just made an appointment with the florist.  We can drive by after caravan.  I'd be having a complete meltdown If it wasn't for you, syl.  Believe me, I'm happy for the distraction.  From what? You have such a charmed life.  On the outside, in front of company.  But miguel, when we're alone he's   Syl, what? He just He goes to this dark place.  I know he lost his brother And now his other brother's in trouble but   That would put a strain on anybody.  But he's being secretive.  He's never home.  He says he's with dexter, but I think it's a cover.  Are you sure you're not reading into it? I mean, I went through the same thing with dexter.  He was disappearing, Acting weird.  What happened? He was   He was Going through a difficult time.  Rita, tell me.  He was doing drugs and he was having an affair.  Dexter? God.  If someone like dexter can do that   Look, we hadn't defined Our relationship yet.  It wasn't like you guys.  It was different.  But the important thing is that I confronted him, We talked about it, and it actually Brought us closer together.  You just confronted him? Well, if you don't deal with your problems They only get bigger, right? Dexter? Really? I know, I know.  There's no way your nickname was worse than \"fat tista\".  'cause \"gianna\" just rolls off the   \"va gianna. \" Okay, you win.  Kids can be cruel.  \"fat tista\", huh? You can call me whatever you want.  Ah, too soon.  Ah, it's okay.  I'm very patient.  Actually, angel, i, uh   I think you're great but   But.  I hate that word.  I like spending time with you.  It's all right.  You can say it.  You want us to be just friends.  I like our friendship.  You gonna make me feel bad for that? No.  I like it too.  But you want more.  You gonna make me feel bad for that? You rang? Ellen.  I didn't expect you to come over.  I didn't expect you to call.  So? I'm starting to think I'm too close to the prado family.  I know one side of them.  Maybe there's more.  There is.  Such as? Broad strokes? Uh, missing evidence, Witness intimidation, jury tampering.  I've got details.  you wanna hear 'em? You have proof? He's a bad guy.  He's not a stupid guy.  He couldn't have changed that much.  Hmm, maybe he didn't.  My ex husband was always a prick.  I just didn't wanna see it.  It's a little hard to take in, you know? It's about to get much harder.  That's actually why I came in person.  Miguel's on his way over here right now.  What? Why? To negotiate the terms of albert chung's surrender.  You're not representing albert chung.  Chung saw himself on tv And called me.  I'm here as his counsel.  You call miguel prado a bad guy While representing someone like that? It's not my job to judge, maria.  Well, you're certainly judging miguel.  And if he ever gets arrested, I will defend him too.  Fucking albert chung.  That dipshit's photo has gotten more prime time play Than any asian face in years.  Way to represent.  It also got over 600 tipsters calling in.  Folks up in arms over this one.  Hey, guys? I need your addresses for the wedding And I need to know if you're bringing dates.  Can we bring \"just friends\"? I never bring dates to a wedding.  Best man always hooks up with the maid of honor.  The maid of honor is rita's daughter.  She's ten.  Masuka's your best man? I, uh, hadn't really   why? Are you asking batista? 'cause I'd be honored, hermano.  Um, uh, I don't   I'm not having a best man.  What about ushers? I need back copies of your reports On the skinner cases.  All of them.  You looking for anything in particular? Something, anything.  I need a fucking lead, dex.  I'll be here all night if I have to.  Diligent.  Not really.  Did you ever You know, compromise an investigation For personal reasons? Never.  Figures.  Where did you get these? Camilla.  She's in a lot of pain.  Then I hope she goes fast.  Not likely.  Just shoot me if I ever get like that.  Really? Hell yes.  I'd do the same for you.  Pull the plug, put a pillow over your head, whatever.  I'd never let you suffer.  You wouldn't, would you? Dexter.  Will you bring the prelim blood report On lisa morton to the briefing room? Miguel prado's asking for it.  He's here? He and ellen wolf.  To negotiate the terms Of albert chung's surrender.  Wear your flak jacket.  I'm not interested in your terms, counselor.  Albert chung needs to turn himself in.  If you want albert chung I suggest You get interested, counselor.  Preliminary blood report as requested.  I'd actually like dexter to stay.  Ms.  wolf might need A forensics expert to explain to her How hopeless her case really is.  Oh, please, do stay.  Dexter.  He wants me to see how bad ellen wolf really is.  This is me open minded.  Go ahead with your terms, counselor.  My client requests the news media be present And that he be allowed to make a statement.  He requests the charge be kicked down to manslaughter.  Hmm, you've gotta be kidding.  He also requests conjugal visitation.  Jesus, you have no shame! And no case! Run the evidence From the crime scene, will you? Blood at the scene belonged to albert chung.  Dna matched his sample in our database.  Odds are 170 million to one That it's anyone but albert chung.  Mmm, it won't hold up.  You do know what odds are? The jury won't.  Not when I get done discrediting you And your chain of custody.  I think we all know How easy it is to plant evidence And, well You look the type.  Do I see sheets of plastic in your future? Dexter's work is solid, ellen.  Your prosecutor isn't.  Walk in the park to discredit you, counselor.  Try it.  We're gonna add slander to aiding and abetting.  Oh, I'm not the one on trial.  Oh, you should be.  you should be! Getting your brother off with a slap on the wrist! Not to mention the chicky hines debacle.  All right, let's stay on point here.  if albert chung kills again While you pursue this bullshit, that blood is gonna Be on your hands.  or do you even care? Like you do? You spout off about justice And the constitution Except for that pesky part about everyone Deserving a fair trial.  While you set free the scum of the earth For a fast buck, right? How many pro bonos do you take on, miguel? How many innocent people have you saved From fascistic prosecutors   Ellen.  Don't kid yourself.  You might as well be walking the street, The way you make a living.  Okay, enough, enough! Dexter, would you step outside, please? Yeah.  Miguel, you know that that was completely out of line.  I'm no fan of ellen wolf's, but all I see Is a defense attorney doing her job.  Maybe too well.  But I can't kill her for that.  Now I have to tell miguel no.  Not what he wants to hear.  You're going the wrong way, morgan.  I'm just grabbing dinner, sarge.  I'm gonna do some overtime on the skinner case.  What do you hear from anton? He's not answering his calls but I think he probably   Yeah, that's good.  Okay, see you.  Gianna? Hey, just heading out.  A buddy of mine is getting married in a few weeks And he asked me if I was gonna bring a date And you're the only one I want to invite.  You're inviting me to a wedding? Maybe you don't get the concept of friends? It's not a date.  It's  it's a plus one.  The wedding is beside the point.  It made me realize That you're the one I wanna spend time with.  And if us being friends means I get to keep doing that, I'm in.  This isn't some kind of weird end run is it? Make me see how sensitive you really are? I'm not all that sensitive.  yeah, you are.  I'm confused.  I'm   Hand holding.  So simple.  So intimate.  Souncomfortable.  Sorry about the pie.  I was told it was the best.  Got five stars.  Don't worry about it.  Until you find me the perfect key lime pie I have something to live for.  Dexter, I'm so sorry For putting you in that horrible position.  Asking you to violate your conscience Was one of the worst things I've ever done.  I want to you help you, camilla.  If I were someone else, I'd do it.  I know.  I should have thought about your past Before I asked.  My past? I know your secret, dexter.  You think If you help me die You'll be like him.  Your brother.  Brian moser.  The ice truck killer.  I don't have a brother.  You did.  I read your file before I destroyed it.  Your birth mother was laura moser.  When the newspaper said brian moser Was the ice truck killer I made the connection.  Camilla   It's all right, dexter.  I'll take it to my grave.  And you could never be like him.  No.  I had a high opinion of you, deb.  Guess I was wrong.  I told you repeatedly to stay out of my shit And you wouldn't.  So you told quinn I was investigating him, He did what he does, and now the case is dead.  You chose the wrong friend.  Hey, you're the one who fucked him.  Not my fault he didn't want an encore.  Is that what he told you this was about? He didn't have to.  It was obvious.  Little miss heartbreak Turns a cadillac and a fancy watch Into a fucking i. a.  investigation.  How is that even original? What an empty room your world must be If those are the dots you connected.  I'm happily married.  Seven years.  Working on our second kid.  With zero interest in a waste of clothes like quinn.  Fine.  I really don't give a shit.  Well then give a shit about this.  A cop's dead 'cause quinn cut all of the wrong corners.  I came to you for help To get him out of circulation.  You refused.  Next dead cop's on you.  A dinner party.  Washing dishes.  It seems so mundane.  But it's oddlysoothing.  Maybe this is what belonging feels like.  Keep this up, we're looking like dishpan hands.  I should add rubber gloves To our gift registry for dexter.  We can do that? Oh, you can register for anything.  Furniture, motorcycles, power tools.  Power tools.  Ah, jesus, sylvia! Come on, use your brains, baby! We just got this thing re stained! I got it.  It's fine.  Yeah.  Uh, why don't syl and I finish the dishes And we'll put dessert in the oven? And you guys pop a movie in for the kids.  Uh, yeah, sounds good.  Movie time, kids.  Come on, muchachos.  Uncle miguel's gonna put a movie on for you.  Sorry about that.  He probably invited you guys over So he wouldn't have to be alone with me.  Things haven't gotten any better? Worse after I confronted him.  Oh, no.  He just completely shut down.  Now he can't even be civil in front of company.  I'm so sorry.  I never should have said anything.  No.  It's not your fault.  Maybe dexter's a bad influence on him? I know.  Wishful thinking.  He'd be a problem I could actually fix.  He's going to bring up ellen wolf And I have to tell him no.  Can friends do that? So, uh, ellen wolf.  Piece of work, right? Go easy.  Be tactful.  We can't kill her.  I see.  She'sjust doing her job.  You should tell that to the parents of all Of those people that her clients have killed.  Yeah, I read about them.  I also read about the wrongly convicted people She got off death row.  The defense fund she set up.  She's fucking with the system.  Eating away at it from the inside out.  Control, dexter.  that's what she likes.  And now she's trying to control me.  Re opening my cases.  Undermining years of all my hard work.  So this is personal? Fuck yes, this is personal.  And it should be personal for you too.  As my friend I'm asking you to do this for me.  I'm sorry, no.  Well, then fuck you! She's fucking with my life! I'm gonna go.  I've never been great at conflict resolution.  Not without a blade and several rolls of plastic wrap.  Did dexter and miguel have a fight? No, sweetie.  Did you? Uh, why don't you guys go get ready for bed? So what happened? You grabbed us outta there so fast And you've been grinding your teeth the whole way home.  I disagreed with him.  About the affair? What affair? Syl thinks there's someone else.  He's definitely obsessed with someone But there's no affair.  And there's not Going to be one either.  What? I'm confusing my metaphor.  Well, friends fight sometimes.  I'm not sure he'd consider me much of a friend right now.  Hey, you're a great friend.  The problem's his.  Well, either way, Life was good before him.  It'll be good after.  It's all right to be upset.  I'm not upset.  Yo, dex.  Put me down for a plus one to the wedding.  The list.  Right.  Hey, that's a plus one.  Okay.  Sarge.  yeah? I think morgan needs an intervention.  She's been here all night.  She find anything? I don't know.  She's waiting on you for the big reveal.  Batista may be plus one, but after last night I'm minus miguel.  But with or without my help, camilla's on her way out.  It's okay.  I'm better off on my own.  I can't believe this jackass is still on the run.  You know, he kinda looks like you.  That  that   That's called racism, buddy, so don't even   Oh, shit.  He does look like me.  I found a fucking lead on the skinner case.  In the trees, Right? We've had our heads up our asses, sarge.  We've been looking down at the bodies But no one has been looking up.  How much caffeine have you had? A metric fuck ton.  You should stop.  It's giving you tourette's.  Our second victim, right? Javier garza.  I'm looking through it And I remember talking to this george guy.  This tree trimmer, george something.  It reminds me of that fucking mess At lorna owen's house, right? Where somebody had trimmed the trees And they didn't bother to clean it up.  So I'm thinking, \"trimmed trees.  Tree trimmer. \" Maybe there's a connection? Okay.  So I looked through every fucking photo Of every fucking crime scene and guess what I found? Trimmed trees? No, I didn't find shit.  But when I looked at the homes of the victims   Motherfucking trimmed trees.  The skinner is using tree trimming As a cover for surveillance.  He watches from the trees and when the time is right He grabs them.  Tree trimmers, landscapers Blends right in.  Check city maintenance schedules.  Get sub contractors names.  Anyone who's worked near any of the victims' homes.  Let's bring 'em in.  I still can't get a hold of anton.  I think he might have skipped town.  Then it's a good thing you found a new lead.  Huh, morgan? Good work.  Anton skips town.  You find a new lead.  Pretty convenient.  Up all fucking night.  Nothing convenient about it.  Not all of us cut corners, detective.  You haven't been answering the phone.  I've been busy.  I can see that.  I can also see that you're troubled.  Yeah.  That conscience I don't have? It's been eating away at me.  I know.  I'll turn my client in.  Then I'll feel better.  You're only half joking.  You wanna bring in albert chung As badly as we do.  I'm here to help.  You can't.  I canif you let me.  If I let you I'll be violating privilege.  Well, that's where the help part comes in.  See, I'm getting to know you and that granite set Of ethics you've got.  Couldn't crack 'em even if I wanted to.  You know that about me, huh? Yep.  But it's your job To make sure albert chung has his day in court.  And it's my job to make sure that happens.  I've got several ways of doing that.  For instance, Sometimes I set up surveillance Outside his attorney's office.  Only an idiot would ask for a meeting here.  Only an idiot.  I am not good at this.  Letting people help me.  I know that about you too.  Why do you think I brought the scotch? Deb, angel plus one, vince Maria laguerta Doughnut guy? I see him everyday.  If you don't know his name, he's not invited.  We can come back.  Dexter, bring that girl of yours in here.  I'm here.  I'm right here.  It's so nice to finally meet you.  Oh, rita.  You know, I've got it.  Hey, you came.  You called.  What the fuck are you doing here? I live here.  Not here.  Here.  We thought you left.  We pulled your security detail.  I have two dead bolts and a nosy neighbor.  I think I'm safe.  Well, you'd be a lot safer in chicago.  I didn't wanna go without talking to you first.  I wanted to say thanks, you know, For giving me the heads up.  I do get free long distance.  You could have called me from chicago.  I didn't wanna go to chicago, debra.  I know what you did for me.  And I know what it could cost you.  And I know how badly you want your shield.  Not if it means using you as bait.  But I'll do it For you.  I'll be your bait.  Thanks for coming.  You hear about albert chung? Who hasn't? You hear how they got him? No.  He showed up at ellen wolf's office for a meeting.  Cops got wind of it.  Sent s. w. a. t.  in.  They did the whole shock and awe thing.  Apparently ellen wolf was in on it.  She helped get him into custody.  You were right about her, dex.  I told you when we first met I usually don't take no for an answer.  That's kind of a button with you, isn't it? It couldn't have been easy for you.  But a good friend   A real friend does the hard thing.  I was out of control.  Letting personal shit cloud up my thinking.  You, you reigned me in.  Well, friends fight, right? I guess so.  They also apologize when they're wrong.  I was wrong.  I apologize.  We're not gonna man hug, are we? How about a beer? Yeah, I'll get it.  Two bottles.  Am I really a good friend? Miguel thinks so.  Rita Camilla I wouldn't know.  I don't have a lot of experience in that area.  To ellen wolf.  Maybe with practice.  Hey, you wanna be my best man? Miguel says a friend does the hard thing.  I agree.  And I'm about to become A true friend to camilla.  My secret ingredient.  Sodium pentothol.  Coma in half a minute.  Pancuronium stops her breathing and then Peace.  For her, anyway.  Dexter.  I have a gift for you.  It'll make you feel better.  Thank you.  Are you sure? I'm sure.  You finally brought me The perfect pie.  I'll tell gene You say, \"hello\".  I'm doing a good thing, aren't i? Then why does it feel so Bad? I want you to know that you were right About my brother.  But there's something else.  I killed him.  It's good You did.  All the lives I've taken, they've always begged for mercy.  I've never understood that concept until now.  This.  This is mercy.  But only for a friend.      Previous EpisodeNext Episode"

Keep an open mind about her.  Miguel's on his way over here right now.  I know one side of him.  maybe there's more.  Missing evidence, Witness intimidation, jury tampering.  You got proof? he's a bad guy.  he's not a stupid guy.  I'm pregnant.  They say this part should pass soon.  This isn't some kind of weird end run, is it? Make me see how sensitive you really are? I'm not all that sensitive.  yeah, you are.  Someone loaned freebo some money And is willing to skin people to get it back.  Which is why I want to use Our c. i.  more aggressively.  Wait.  you mean anton? Yeah, we're gonna spread the word That anton knows where freebo is.  You're gonna use him as bait? Which means that the skinner Will be looking for me.  Am I being set up? I found the fucking lead on the skinner case.  The skinner is using Tree trimming as a cover for surveillance.  He watches from the trees, And when the time is right, he grabs them.  I know what you did for me.  I will be your bait.  So you told quinn I was investigating him.  Hey, you're the one who fucked him.  Not my fault he didn't want an encore.  Cop's dead 'cause quinn cut all the wrong corners.  Next dead cop's on you.  What did it feel like to end his life? Felt like justice.  We're like minded.  Together we can make a difference.  It's said that everything is connected to everything.  The butterfly effect.  You drop a pebble into a pond, And the ripples radiate outwards, Touching and affecting everything.  Until finally a fish grows arms and legs And crawls out of the water.  And picks up a rock and smashes the next two fish over the head.  And we have the first serial killer.  This is good pizza.  On television What channel's espn over here? I think it's a big number.  Yeah, there you go.  And now we got gary going the other way.  Tryin' to get in.  No way.  that's not a foul, man.  That was definitely wrong what that guy did.  You're clearly not a sports fan, are you? Not really.  I'm more of a national geographic kind of guy.  Sharks, bears, the occasionally penguin.  You do have other interests, though.  Yeah, I suppose I do.  Speaking of which Uh, boundaries.  Eh, it's encrypted.  Oh, yeah, that's right.  trust issues.  Football.  See.  you do know your sports.  This guy right here.  Billy fleeter.  Should I know him? Not yet, but hopefully, you will.  This was from maybe five years ago.  He never went pro.  Drug problem.  turned to gambling.  Unfortunately, he wasn't very good at it.  More than once he's paid his debts off To his bookies by working as an enforcer.  Breaking fingers? Crushing skulls with a baseball bat.  I went after him A few years ago, but I just couldn't get the evidence.  I had to tell the children of a 70 year old man That he had just killed That there was nothing we could do.  So here it comes.  Miguel wants me to kill him.  I don't want you to kill him.  No? I wanna do it.  You.  I've let you do all of the heavy lifting so far.  Now it's my turn.  I'm ready to get my hands dirty.  It's one thing to let miguel provide a little backup, Another thing to share the reins with him.  I'm gonna need your help, dexter.  Not a good idea.  Just, uh, think about it.  No, dexter, Don't think about it.  The waffle is a lot like the pancake, Only square.  Why is it square? Because it was invented by simon p.  waffle, And he liked to stack his waffles in boxes, And that's just easier to do if they're square.  You're making that up.  I'm hurt that you would even think that.  Oh, god, dexter, you're making a mess.  That's okay.  we'll clean it up.  It's not the point.  What is the point? I don't know.  The point is not to make a mess to begin with.  Rita's pregnancy hormones seem to be Ganging up on us this morning.  How come there are no english muffins left? Uh, I think you ate the last one yesterday.  waffle? Uh, that's disgusting.  Cody, you need a haircut.  Let's seefour, five, six more months Till she delivers.  Rita, are you okay? No, I'm not okay.  Right, I am starting a new job And I'm planning a wedding all by myself.  What can I do to help? It's not like you can pick out the deejay.  Last time I got into your car, Your radio was tuned to marching music.  It helps me think.  And it's not like you can pick the florist Or the caterer or even the wedding bands.  I could pick the wedding bands.  Right.  Just like the engagement ring you never gave me.  You said you didn't want one.  I don't want one.  Who drank all the orange juice? Jesus christ.  what? You have like no hot water in your shower.  All right.  Yeah, I told you to wait, remember? Well, I can't wait.  some of us have jobs to get to.  I'm a musician.  I work nights.  Yeah, and what do you do with the rest of your day? You take a nap, you watch cartoons.  Jack off.  Oh, I rarely watch cartoons.  Fucking hilarious.  Well, you better not be writing any more songs about me.  Most ladies would be flattered.  Well, most ladies aren't cops.  Oh, right.  Right.  I gotta go.  You okay? Come get these.  Yeah.  Freebo's dead.  And now there's a tree trimmers' convention in here.  It seems random, but it's not.  The butterfly effect again.  Of course, it's an odd sensation When you happen to be the butterfly.  And if I were to help miguel kill billy fleeter Who knows the effect that would have on the world? Is this the beginning Of a whole new level of friendship? Is it the end of life as I know it? Mr.  king, We met at the scene of our second victim, is that correct? Yes, that is correct.  Great.  have you ever worked at any of these addresses? No, no, see, these are city jobs.  I'm a private contractor.  Okay, well, I'm gonna need a list of all of your employees.  I can get you a copy of my payroll records.  That would be a big help.  How soon do you need this? Ten minutes ago would be great.  Very well.  thank you.  Looks like someone got lucky last night.  Uh, let's just say That barbara and I have taken it to the next level.  You know that now you've done the deed, She's gonna be taking notes, Making a checklist of your every move, To see if you're relationship material, right? That's not true.  wait, is it? Well, it's not like we write anything down.  It'smore of a mental process.  Morning, loo.  Third day in a row of this, huh? Let's hope something shakes loose on this.  come here.  Uh, I have a favor to ask you.  Shoot.  You know I got to go to that peace officers Association thing tomorrow night.  You wanna  you wanna be my date? Maria, um, Thank you for the invite.  But I have plans.  And if I bail, I don't think it's gonna go over too well.  Like that.  huh.  Okay.  good for you.  okay.  Relationships are complicated.  Letting miguel kill fleeter would be a gamble.  This guy's a gambler.  look where it got him.  Something to consider when miguel and I do Our research tonight at the casino.  How'd you find out about this place? Research.  Always a first good step, right? Move a little closer? Tonight is just about watching, learning his routine   Where does he go, When does he go, what does he do when he gets there.  Okay.  later, we'll meet him.  We? Yeah, we'll see how it goes.  Right now, we don't want him to notice us.  We don't want anyone to notice us.  Cameras all over the place.  Number one rule of the code is \"don't get caught. \" Code? what code? How much do I tell him? It's just a series of precautions.  Learned where? Common sense mostly.  A little more than that.  Well, my dad was a cop.  Right, right.  So he taught you what cops look for in an investigation.  Oh, and so you work it backwards from there, right? Plus I spend all day looking at other people's mistakes.  You pick things up.  I'm sure.  Am I forgetting something, dexter? Was there one final lesson where I said, \"go now, Far and wide, and preach the code, my son\"? I don't think so.  So when you popped anton for drug possession, Was it just pot, or was it coke or   What was it? Uh, pot, I think.  Right.  right, it couldn't have been Anything too serious, Or you wouldn't have made him a c. i.  I guess.  You're just full of answers today.  I i i just busted guys like him every day.  I don't remember, And it's all written down somewhere.  Right.  c. i.  files.  Hello? Hey, lazy, hope I'm waking you up.  Hey, lazy? I haven't been to bed yet.  Look, I need your c. i.  number.  I'm gonna file a status report.  What's a c. i.  number? Your assigned confidential informant number.  It should be on your paychecks.  What checks? Hello.  your paychecks from the county.  Hello.  I don't get any paychecks.  Quinn always pays me in cash.  Oh.  Okay.  I'll get it from him then.  My client was supposed to be sent to county yesterday.  Apparently he was, but then they put him On the next bus right back here in the afternoon.  I've been chasing him all over the place.  We shouldn't have those mix ups.  Is it a mix up, Or is miguel fucking with me? Ever since I started looking into him, He's been going out of his way to make my job harder.  Well, you knew that was gonna happen.  Doesn't mean I can't bitch about it.  Oh, anyway, I should go see my client And ask what perfectly logical reason he had For lighting his ex wife's house on fire.  Oh, I wanted to ask you.  Any chance you'd go to a police charity function With me tomorrow night? Room full of cops? I can't imagine anything more fun.  Shouldn't have asked.  I'm kidding.  I'd love to go.  Okay, next on your list, mr.  king, Santiago ramirez.  He no longer works for me.  That didn't end so well.  Why? he was run over.  Uh, mario astorga.  didn't I talk to him? Yes, if you remember, He's the one who found the body of that man.  Right.  second victim.  Mario's one of my best foremen.  So he's a good guy? What, he's not a good guy? He has a temper.  he gets very angry.  Keep going.  I knew his family back in nicaragua.  We're both from san marcos.  But mario had to leave.  Why? The police were looking for him.  I heard he killed someone with a knife.  Do you know where I can find mario? I don't know where he lives.  But tomorrow, he'll be at bayside park.  You sure? I make the schedule.  Fleeter pays off his gambling debts By eliminating people for his bookie.  A schoolteacher here, a mother of two there.  People who can't settle their debts.  Sending a message to others   \"pay up. \" Do I help miguel move forward on this, Or do I listen to harry and shut it down? Hey, you.  Yeah, I just heard a love song on the radio That reminded me of you.  Oh, that's sweet.  And it made me really angry.  So have you gotten the wedding bands yet? Um, I'm still doing my research, but I'm on it.  I gotta go.  Hey, you know anything about wedding rings? Yeah.  Wedding rings and nuclear fission are Like my secret specialties.  Thanks.  Your brother's kind of a dweeb, huh? You say anything more about my brother, And I will kick your fucking nuts down your throat.  That doesn't even make any sense.  So, hey, anton doesn't have any priors, You pay him in cash, And I can't find him in the c. i.  database.  Should be in there.  What are you hiding? Anton is not officially a c. i.  What do you mean? Come here for a second.  Look, it was just easier for both of us.  I never filed an arrest report on him So he has no police record.  I did him a favor.  Plus, it saved me the hassle of all that paperwork.  You have got to be fucking kidding me.  We used him as bait.  He was putting his life at risk, and he was Under no legal obligation to help us.  No, no, no, there was just no paperwork, that's all.  Not to mention the fact That because he's not officially a c. i. , There's no end date to when he's done working for us, So you can just string him along as long as you want to.  What are you getting so upset about? What, are you in love with the guy? No, I'm not in love with him.  But you're sleeping with him.  Jesus christ, Do you know what kind of a bonehead mistake that is? Sleeping with an informant? I mean, it's that kind of judgment'll Screw up your career.  He's not an informant.  you just said it.  But you didn't know.  Either way, it makes you look stupid.  No, you don't get to lecture me, asshole.  Anton could so easily file a huge lawsuit Against the police department Once he finds out how you fucked him over.  Yeah, if someone told him.  Of course I'm gonna tell him.  You'll sell out a cop for some dope you're fucking? That's not half as bad as being responsible For another cop dying Because you don't like to play by the rules.  What? Yuki told me.  You don't know what the fuck you're talking about.  Despite harry's warnings, Here I am with miguel, outside billy fleeter's house.  If I'm gonna stop this, it's gonna have to be soon.  Are you sure you want to do this? It's breaking and entering.  But you know that.  Yes, I do.  let's go.  Here, put these on.  Forensics guy who always has latex gloves on him.  No one would ever think twice, huh? I guess you're right.  I don't want miguel to see how easy this is for me.  Uh, you want me to try? No, I think i   I got it.  So what are we looking for? Proof.  That he's guilty.  We know he bludgeons people to death, So look for something bludgeony.  Uh, this looks like it's been knocked around some.  Hold it up.  Purple? Ergo Blood.  How easy is this? I'll test it against the blood of his alleged victims.  Let you know later today.  You know it takes me two days To get a search warrant, Then another day to catalog evidence, And then, a week before I can get the lab results.  This is definitely the way to go.  We also need to make sure that he's likely to kill again.  Why is that? It's just one of the rules.  One of these days I'm gonna make you sit down And write out all these rules for me, but okay.  He  he kills whenever he needs money.  That's how he pays off his debts to the bookie.  Dex, I've tried a lot of these gamblers before, And they all keep records.  They're like anal about their numbers.  There's got to be like a ledger Around here somewhere.  Maybe there's a hidden wall safe or something.  We're talking about the man who leaves his murder weapon In an umbrella stand.  Yeah, you're right.  What if we don't find anything? Then we don't move forward.  Leave it, dex.  Just put it back.  You can stop this right now.  Call it off.  Why should I call it off? I didn't teach you the code to share with your buddies.  I taught you the code to keep you alive.  You don't get to have friends, dexter.  Nothing good can come out of this.  Hey, dex, you know what, I don't think We're gonna find anything here, man.  Look at you.  It's my life, dad.  I think we know how he's gonna pay that off.  So, look, we moving forward? Yeah, moving forward.  If the blood matches.  I can't believe we are just now sending out invitations.  This is so last minute.  It's okay.  there's plenty of time.  And dexter's no help.  Do you know, I asked him for menu suggestions   Do you know what he says? I don't know.  Steak.  he says steak.  Yeah, that's great, dexter.  That's really great.  We'll start with a steak appetizer, Followed by steak salad, Followed, of course, by a steak, And then, of course, it'll all be topped off By a steak fucking cake.  Rita.  Rita.  What? The envelope.  You're making a mess.  Why don't you stuff for a while? And I'll do the addresses.  Okay.  I've got big news.  Yeah, about the skinner? No, about you.  You're free.  Oh, yeah, ever since abe lincoln.  I mean from the police department.  You're no longer a c. i.  Hold on, wait a second.  The way quinn explained it was, if I play ball, It would knock down my felony possession To a misdemeanor, and if I worked hard enough, It would go away all together.  Well, it's gone away.  Hmm, how's that? Clerical error.  The necessary papers were never filed, So there were never any charges for you to work off.  Wait, so I've been doing all this shit When I didn't have to? Just be glad you don't have to do it anymore.  Well, thank you.  And I want to put protective detail on you.  What? no.  no, debra.  Anton.  listen.  You said I'm free, So I'm free of this.  So we should celebrate.  Dinner tonight.  Mm, no, I'm working tonight.  How about we celebrate now? I've got to go back to work.  Tomorrow.  breakfast.  Perfect.  So I'm guessing we got a blood match, huh? That's why we're here.  Life vests? We can't exactly load up the cart With axes and machetes, now can we? Exactly right.  So, um, have you given any thought As to how you want to do this? Mm hmm.  small caliber gun to the head.  Then I walk away.  That happens all the time.  Guns make noise.  And they leave evidence behind  bullets, Casings, powder residue.  Not to mention the body.  Okay.  You don't want to create a crime scene.  It's where experts like me gather evidence against you.  Okay, okay, I get it, I get it.  What do you suggest? Up close and personal.  Hey, in case we have to tie anybody up.  I'm gonna put together a starter kit for you.  Hey, you got better.  Yeah, what do you know? What better place to gamble on miguel Than a room full of games of chance? Where slot machines go to die, huh? And at least one gambler.  I think that's it.  Now we pick up mr.  fleeter.  You ever drop a quart of milk? Watch it spread over the whole kitchen floor, The mess it makes? There's six quarts of blood in the human body.  This isn't gonna be pretty.  There's no shame in backing out.  Dex, after 14 years of filing briefs, Trying cases, and dealing with bullshit This is all gonna look nice and neat in comparison.  I have been to some lame ass rubber chicken dinners In my day, okay.  I know, I know.  A no host bar is punishment enough, But no bar at all is cruel.  And unusual.  All right, I'm buying the first round.  Thank you.  That's pretty.  Gift from my first husband.  Nice, nice.  You're handsome.  Dire ethanol emergency here.  What'll it be, ladies? Uh, cuba libre for this one.  Gracias.  And a double scotch neat soda back pour moi.  Very nice.  Easy.  Oh, and who was that guy, that  that suit and haircut Sitting next to you that wouldn't shut up? Oh, the, um, the senior liaison For the greater mi   who knows? I don't know   what's sad is that this is The only social event I've been to in six months.  Oh, that doesn't qualify as a social event.  Okay.  Can I get you anything else? Yeah, how about a foot massage With those big, gorgeous hands of yours? They're kind of cold from scooping ice.  Hmm, but you're hot.  Cheers.  Nothing shy about you, huh? no.  Well After a pair of empty marriages, I realized the secret to long life and happiness is, well, chocolate and flirting with young, hopefully hung men.  Sounds fattening and dangerous.  Oh, but so fun.  hmm.  Which, clearly, you're not having enough of.  I am.  mm.  Look, believe me, I've had my fun.  You need to be raising hell and breaking hearts.  I need to be? you need to be.  The skirt wearing days do not last forever.  We all end up old and in the way.  I tell miguel to be inconspicuous, And what does he do? He shows up looking like the unabomber.  I've got my work cut out for me.  Oh, close game, close game.  Yeah, good deed.  Good game, huh? No, it's not a good game.  Good game is when they don't beat the fucking point spread.  Oh, you got a little money riding on this? A little bit.  Shit.  Sorry.  Not half as sorry as somebody else is gonna be.  Here we go.  Buenas noches, patron.  Hey, who was that guy? Uh, I don't know.  some guy.  How do you know him? I don't.  Dex, sometimes people recognize me.  It's off.  We're not doing this.  We need to take down the kill room.  No, no, dex, let's just wait.  No one ever goes in that room there.  You saw.  Tranquilo, huh? We decide tomorrow, okay? We'll see.  Anton.  me again.  Waiting on you still.  The way I figured it, You gigged until closing, And then you went home and smoked some of that herb That you keep in your cereal box.  And now, like all self indulgent, Vaguely adolescent musicians, You are sleeping in till noon   and I'm okay with that.  Okay? I'm okay with that.  As long as you're alone.  Okay, okay.  too much caffeine.  A dutch farmer sees his crop fail.  No money to his name, he takes a job working on a boat.  An unseasonably strong wind blows him to indonesia.  He drops a bean into the soil.  And voila, 400 years later Java.  Everything is connected.  Hello? Dex, wanna hook up for breakfast? I'm buying.  I would, deb, but I'm already freshly bageled.  What are you doing up so early? Trying to be a good fiance.  Rita made me vice president in charge of wedding rings, So I'm off to the jewelry store.  And what do you know about buying women jewelry? Zero.  Less than.  jesus, dex.  Look, I'll meet you at that place on second street At 10:00, okay? The wedding band has to match the engagement ring, So what does that look like? She said she didn't want one.  My god, you just get dumber every day.  How do you survive in this world? Of course she wants one.  How am I supposed to know that? You're such a y chromosome cliche.  Just buy her a beautiful, romantic, I love you with all of my heart fucking engagement ring.  And dex, Size matters.  Can I ask you something Non jewelry wise? Go for it.  Okay, hypothetically Let's say that this guy has to work With this girl, but he fucking hates doing it, And too bad 'cause he has no fucking choice.  And? And one thing leads to another And this hypothetical guy Starts having sex with this hypothetical girl.  Hypothetical sex? Real sex.  Really real sex.  But then the guy is told that he no longer has to work With this girl, and poof, he just disappears.  You know.  thin air.  adios.  So I'm wondering, is it possible If mr.  hypothetical never really was all that into this girl? And he was just getting it on to, I don't know, pass the time Or satisfy primal urges or whatever? Sounds perfectly reasonable to me.  What the fuck do you know? That one.  I gotta go sit in a hot car and wait for a suspect.  Hey, anton What the fuck? call me.  I can bring mario in myself.  Let you get all the credit for catching the skinner? No fucking way.  We don't know he's the skinner.  Closest thing we got.  That was really fucking unfair what you said yesterday.  Well, is it true? That a cop died because of you? It's not that simple.  Try me.  Yuki amado was my partner in narcotics.  There was another detective on our team, stewart.  He made a bad judgment call and shot an unarmed coke dealer.  I remember that.  Paralyzed him, right? Then stewart went on a bender Until he finally swallowed his own bullet.  How does yuki make that your fault? Because stewart had a problem with crystal meth.  And I knew it.  And rather than bust him, I tried to protect him.  So it is your fault.  Listen to you.  Everything is so black and white.  You could have stopped him.  Yeah, sure, if I knew what I knew now.  But that's not the way things work.  I'm sorry.  you're just making excuses.  Yeah, of course I'm making excuses.  Don't you? I mean, how else do you sleep at night? Who the fuck said I sleep at night? Then you must be killing yourself Over hooking up with anton, huh? Yeah, it was probably a mistake.  I think he lost all interest Once he realized he was free.  Not so black and white, is it? Mario.  Mario astorga? Fuck! I'm guessing he didn't want to come in for questioning.  He made a run for it.  Interview two.  What's his story? So far, he hasn't said a word.  Ah, you keep at it.  And you check with nicaraguan authorities on priors.  We're just waiting to hear back.  I'm never gonna get out of here.  I gotta call barbara and cancel our dinner.  Oh, she's not gonna like that.  I mean, it  it's work.  I'm not here.  Leave a message.  Hello, barbara.  This is sergeant angel batista.  Angel to you.  How are you? Good I hope.  So I have to cancel our dinner tonight.  And I am deeply, deeply apologetic.  And I hope that you will let me make it up to you In whatever possible way You wish things made up To you in.  Oh, I can tell By that look on your face, You're trying to figure out how to tell me something I don't wanna hear.  Calling off the kill.  It's over.  Really, dex? Just because some guy recognized me in a bar? No one is ever gonna make that connection Once fleeter disappears.  I'm not taking that chance.  'cause that's not the way you do things.  right.  No, it isn't.  Tell me about that.  What are you asking? I wasn't gonna bring it up before, But I'm guessing You've been doing this for a while.  Freebo wasn't your first.  Was he? How many, dex? Okay, you know what, it doesn't matter.  I will respect your privacy.  But I just don't understand Why are you not gonna help me here? Just because we  we broke this little rule from your code? Come on, dex.  it's okay.  No, it's not okay.  You never should have asked me to help you.  You're not ready.  I'm not   or is it you that's not ready? Because we could have dealt with this fleeter problem like three times already, And you keep throwing up all of these roadblocks With all this code bullshit.  It's not bullshit.  Oh, come on.  keep telling yourself that, dex.  Come on, it's like wearing a fucking strait jacket, man.  No, miguel, it's just the opposite.  If I didn't have the code, the darkness   I could stand here and tell you Another story about my abusive father, But what I haven't told you about is the time That I kicked the shit out of him And knocked him down a flight of stairs.  And I really enjoyed it.  That was the first time in my life That I've ever felt Powerful like Like I was in control of  of something.  And ever since then, I've been trying To  to get that feeling back again.  So when you talk to me about The darkness inside of you I understand.  I really do.  I just want to let some of mine out too.  I know you understand that.  You know what, mr.  astorga? Maybe I should have opened with my closer.  Meaning? We know about the incident in managua, The one where you stabbed a cab driver.  He touched my sister.  Sadly, he survived.  That's a heartbreaking story.  Still you are an illegal guest Of our country.  immigration's on the way.  You're gonna be on a plane before the sun comes up.  But I have a son.  He was born here.  He's a u. s.  citizen.  He's my life.  Your boy's a u. s.  citizen? Yes.  Then he stays.  maybe your wife too.  We don't know yet.  But we do know is if you keep Stonewalling us on this skinner case, You are gone on a one way ticket.  No matter what you try to do to me, The facts ain't changing.  'cause I don't know anything about anything.  Then why would george king suggest otherwise? Senor king said I knew something? In a word? Yup.  And senor king will be very disappointed To hear you're calling him a liar.  No! Please.  What are you so afraid of, mario? Yeah, what'd this guy do to you? What can he do to you? Please.  Send me back to nicaragua.  Alone? Si.  yes.  Alone.  We mentioned george king's name once and he turns to jell o.  Scared to death of him.  You thinking what I'm thinking? Yeah, king jobbed us.  I'm gonna issue a bolo for him.  Hello? Shit.  Who was it? Uh, me.  I was checking to see if my phone was working.  Barbara never called me back.  I think I ruined it.  Sorry.  Dating sucks.  Yeah.  Well, I'm outta here.  Still no george king, but we put the word out.  Barbara.  You got my message.  Yup.  been listening to it all day.  Makes me laugh every time.  It's pretty bad, huh? Um, the worst.  I'm glad I amuse you.  Not half as glad as I am.  Hey, did they finish already? They never even started.  What do you mean? Where's anton? He never showed.  Why? I don't know.  They waited an hour.  they called.  Doesn't answer.  Thanks.  What the f   Poetic.  Are you ready? I am.  Thank you.  Thank you for this.  For letting me in.  For showing me the way.  Look at him.  Look at him trying to figure it all out.  What the fuck? We're here because of them.  Those lives that you destroyed.  Who are you? We're justice.  Hey, man, I was just doing what I had to do.  As are we.  I've always done the deed alone.  Never stood outside.  Been a witness to this moment.  The moment of truth.  Can miguel go through with it? Can he step out of the cocoon and fly? How do you feel? Fantastic.  Shouldn't we get him out of here? As bonded as we may feel, there are still things I can't share with miguel.  I got it.  No, it's  it's too much work.  Leaving no trace is my area of expertise.  Yeah, but, dex   Get home before sylvia starts to wonder where you are.  I mean it.  Okay.  I'm going.  Not a good idea.  That would be against your code, huh? Sorry.  Anton, you in there? Hello, anton? Oh, god.  Shit.  Trimmed trees.  The skinner's been here.  You were wrong.  It went well.  Maybe.  Who knows? You can't admit it.  He did good.  That was never the issue, dex.  I was only thinking about you.  Of course.  You've set something in motion here.  Everything miguel does from now on is connected to you.  It's a lot of responsibility teaching him what you just did.  A heavy burden.  It was too much for me to bear.  I hope you're a stronger man.  You're still up.  I can't sleep.  I hope it's okay.  My god.  It's  it's perfect.  Dexter, god, you've been such a saint through all this.  I don't know how you've put up with me.  If you need me to help out With more of the wedding stuff   no.  No, it's It's the hormones.  I go crazy when I'm pregnant.  Tell me about it.  That's not true.  You should just get out while you can.  Just run for your life.  I won't.  I promise.  It's like I have this monster living inside of me, And I don't know how to control it.  Maybe I can help you out with that one.  It's so beautiful.  It's been said That a butterfly can flap its wings in brazil And set off a storm in florida.  I'm taking the chance that's not entirely true.      Previous EpisodeNext Episode"

Jack's hideaway.  Don't worry about syl.  I can handle that.  I got a motion hearingthis morning, though, I don't wanna miss.  I'll get betterat this.  With your help.  I stalked a wife killer at jack's hideaway last year,grabbed him right at closing.  At 2:00 A. M.  Sylvia said miguel got homean hour ago.  Did he just lie? To me? Another detour.  There's nothing here either.  Well, what about the blinds? What about the glass? Checked 'em.  Deb, there's no blood.  Anton didn't just followthe skinner out of here.  I'll keep looking.  I think we needto recanvass.  We've already talkedto everyone in the building.  What about the kids? They're awake now.  We'll talk to the kids.  What do we got? The skinner has anton.  Did you see the trees? I saw them.  It doesn't mean he got nabbed.  The coffee potwas left burning.  I mean, he definitely leftin a hurry.  What the hell was anton doingback in town? He never left.  He contacted me, but he wouldn'tagree to surveillance.  Who cares if he agrees? He's a C. I.  That's why we used himas bait in the first place.  Guys.  No liner.  The building trash dumpster.  Subscription renewal formfrom rolling stone addressed to anton briggs.  This is his garbage.  So the bag split on impactwith the dumpster here.  he threw it.  Defensive move.  Why the hell didn't he usehis fists? he was hurt.  There's blood and some hair.  Looks like he hit his headagainst the wall.  How bad? Hard enough to daze him.  A blow from behind could havepropelled him forward.  So anton comes down to emptythe garbage, the skinner clocks him, he does a headerinto the wall, throws the bagas a last ditch.  Skinner tosses him in the carand peels out.  Got tire marks here.  Fuck.  all right, we got a confirmed missing person.  Anton briggs.  Find a photo.  Get his face outto all patrols and the media.  Set up a tip line.  Pull in some off duties to man the phone bank.  Skinner's had himfor 24 hours.  How long do you thinkhe can hold out? Well, the M. E. 'S reporton the other victims suggests the skinnerstarts slow.  Probably to build fear.  Anton's a big guy.  A lotta skin.  That's meantto be comforting.  George king,we need to bring him in.  We gotta find him first.  We got bolos out on himall night long.  Haven't found him yet.  We could search his house,though.  We still holding king's foremanon resisting arrest, right? He give us anythingthat'll buy us a warrant? Mario astorga clammed up.  Too scared of king.  He would rather be deportedaway from his family than to talk about king.    Is that all we got?   Yeah.  I'll try and finda flexible judge.  Let me knowwhen it comes in.  I'm gonna go siton king's house.  We'll go siton king's house.  Hey, I want thisaboveboard.  Use restraint.  Wait on the warrant.  And I hope they find somethingbecause even if we nab king, we got nothing to hold him onpast today.  A day can savea lot of skin.  I keep telling you.  You have to listen.  If I knewwhere freebo was, I'd tell you.  Don't you fucking understand, man? It was the cops.  I was  I was fucking bait.  All right, all right, you're right.  I know where he is.  I can show you.  I can show you.  All right, listen to me.  He owes you money,right? He owes you money? I can get you money.  I can find you money.  I don't wantyour money.  I loaned freebothat money.  This is about respect.  With your first cut,you had all night to consider my questions.  This cut,you only have one hour.  And when I return,there'll be no rest.  Use the time to think about the skin you have left to lose.  Hi, how are you? Are you screeningyour calls? Ellen? I'm surprised you missed the motion hearing this morning.  So was chicky hines.

For the day.  what are you, a lawyer? Oh, no, wait, I forgot.  You're a fucking tree trimmer.  I moved to this countryfor its amazing liberties.    I know my rights.    Great.  George king is hanging youout to dry, mario.  I thought you might want a chance  I've seen the fear.  An inch away from death fear.  it'd be a shame to leave your wife and your little baby behind.  His is real.  What makes you so scary,george king? you miss your country,george? I like this country,sir.  I like miami, sir.  Nicaragua can be a rough place,huh? You in the military down there? Death squads, contras.  You woulda beenabout the right age to get caught upin that.  You learn a few things there,george? I learn respect, sir.  No interrogation techniques? Maybe a little snatch and grab.  What do they call that? Renditioning? Oh, I don't know that,ma'am.  Ma'am, sir.  You did learn respect.  Did you show any fucking respectto wendell when you tore his skin off? How about anton when you bashedhim over the goddamn head? morgan, you want a coffee? Why don't you geta coffee? Yeah.  Sure.  He looks harmless,doesn't he? They usually do.  I don't know.  Maybe he's not our guy.  Well, you should trustyour instincts on this one.  This oneof your creepy insights? Why does it always haveto be creepy? Fucking tell me.  He's heldlife and death in his hands.  He likes it.  I knew it.  So how do I crackthis sick fuck's brain? From what I've readabout these sick fucks, they usually havesome sort of code.  I'd say disrespect is highon his list of violations.  Maybe if you came at himwith deference.  Deference, huh? Yeah, think about it.  Hey, lieutenant.  I heard you sayyour friend ellen is ill.  Was it a stomach thing? Because I just readthis article  I don't knowwhat it is.  I haven't heard backfrom her.  I left her three messages.  I'm a little worried.  Yeah, me too.  I hope she didn't getin an accident or something.  Excuse me.  I have an errand to run.  A home office.  If she were sick,this is where she'd be.  Her car's here.  She could have gonefor a really long walk.  Or borrowed a friend's car.  Or maybe laguerta's rightand ellen is comatose in some hospital,post accident.  One can hope.  Not that there are any signsof foul play here.  But harry did raise meto be paranoid.  Blood.  Damn it.  No.  Miguel wouldn't do this.  We agreedellen wolf is innocent.  hello.  It's just blood.  There's no body.  He would even knowwhat to do with one.  I never taught himhow to dispose as far as miguel knows,the best place to dispose of a bodyis beneath an open grave.  Good thinking.  Hello.  Uh, set ups arein the kitchen.  Miguel? Hi.  Any bites? No, just nosy neighborsso far.  Syl's office saidthat she would be here.  Is she out back or  no, she wasn't feeling upto an open house, so I'm sitting it for heR.  Well, you'rea good friend.  Here.  You should have these.  How about I make suresyl gets them? Miguel.  Flowers are a good start,but can I be honest? I like honest.    You're an idiot.    That's honest.  You were smart enoughto ask her to marry you, and she's stillthat same fantastic woman.  You don't thinkI know that? Well, you're not actingthat way.  I am not havinga goddamn affair, okay.    All right, let's say that's the truth.    It is.  Either way,you violated her trust.  I just needed space.  I've got everything falling apart around me now, you know, oscar, ramon,now my cases  and the same thingsare falling apart for her, because she's your partner.  You're a wise person,aren't you? Well, if I am, it's onlybecause I've learned from my many, many mistakes.  You have insight.  And I tell you what.  I'm gonna followyour lead.  So point the way.  Mr.  King, I understand that respect is very importantto you.  Yes, ma'am.  And I'm sure you feel that people have to earnyour respect.  Yes, ma'am.  I feellike you've earned this.  What's the matter,little gardener? Huh? You feel disrespected? You'll get used to itin prison because your foreman mario'snext door, and he is spillinghis guts.  You are so surehe's afraid of you.  Why? What did you doto him? What did you doto anton?What did you do? Morgan! Fuck.  Help! Help me! You know, we're supposedto be working together.  You keep going off half cocked.  How am I supposed to trust you? You trust me? That's unbelievable.  You're lucky batista wasn'twatching the monitors.  What the fuckwere you thinking? I was thinkingabout anton.  You oughta try itsome time.  I want to find himjust as bad as you do.  If you gave a shitabout anton, you wouldn't have made himyour fake C. I.  And he wouldn't be messed upin this.  You're the onetoo busy boning him to provide himwith protective surveillance.  You are so crossing the lineright now.  Am I? You knew anton was in town.  And I fucking told himto call it in.  You should have called it inyour fucking self.  I know.  It's my fault.  No, you're right.  I used him.  I just fucking used him.  We can only hold george kingfor a few more hours.  We better get backto work.  Schedule says there arefour funerals today.  Graves back hoed last night.  That's fourmiguel could have chosen from.  She's not here.  That's one down.  That blood might not even belongto ellen.  Could be a client's blood.  Or the previous owner'S.  He did it.  Miguel really did it.  And I taught him how.  I guided him to this.  I created this.  I'm sorry.  Miguel's making his own choicesnow.  Look who he chose.  She didn't deserve this.  You can say it.  Won't change anything, dex, whether I told you so or not.  Easier to accept it.  'Cause there'll be plenty morewhere ellen came from.  No, there won'T.  Hey, miguel, is it too lateto grab that lunch? So what do you thinkof this george king sicko? Skinner suspect? I gotta go from hereto your precinct to discuss whether we're gonnafile charges against this guy.    You thinkhe's the guy?   He's the guy.  Skinner.  Well,if the law can't get him, you and I can.  In fact, I could have this guy outon the streets in a few hours.  You need some helpon this one, or is this another solo project? We agreed to leaveellen wolf alone.  Technically, we agreednot to kill her together.  And we didn'T.    Technically?   I know.  That's that's bullshit.  I didn't tell you because I knowyou wouldn't approve.  'Cause she wasn't guilty.  Apparently, we have a differentdefinition of that word.  You got rid of herbecause she got in your way.  Whatever happenedto serving justice? Is that reallywhy you do this, dex? To serve justice? We don't have to pretendwith each other.    That's what I thought.    Okay.  I should have told you.  It was a chickenshit thingto do, and I abused your trust  a trust, by the way,that wasn't easy to earn.  That's not lost on me.  I gave you my shirtlinking me to freebo's death.  I wish I had another oneto prove to you how importantthis partnership is to me.  I'd takea little remorse.  You would knowthat I don't feel it.  Yeah, you'll feel itif you get caught.  I didn't leaveany evidence.  They're just gonna think it wasone of her scumbag clients.  Right.  Right, just another lowlifewho beat and stabbedan innocent woman.  Again,different definitions.  Dex.  This is the natureof a real friendship.  We're gonna disagree.  And when we do,we just go our own way.  No, no moreindividual projects.  Individuality is what makesamerica great.  I don't think that's whatour forefathers had in mind.  Look.  I'm a big boy.  I know what I'm doing.  Eventually, you're gonna trust that too.  I'll see youover at the precinct.  He thinks he's untouchable.  He's not.  It's time he learned that.  Probably not a lot of leadson that screen.  King's a ghost.  He grabbed anton without a single security camerain the area picking up him or his truck.  There's not one shotto implicate him.  So we'll have to get itout of king.  You gonna let quinn do iton his own.  My time is better spent here.  Away from people.  You know, someone  a good friend, actually  told me I had a big wallaround me.  I thought it made me a better cop.  I don't think it did.  They look at himand see a defender of truth, justice, and the american way.  I see a man about to learna hard lesson.  tire tracks in the alley are consistent with king's truck.  And several otherthousand trucks in the miami metro area.  King's companytrims trees.  Now trimmed trees were foundin every one of the victims' homes.  That's the leadthat nailed him.  I don't know about nailed.  The trees at my placejust got trimmed too.    Yeah, but mario astorga    we're talking about a foreman,right? A foreman who's terrifiedof his boss.  You can arrest my bosson that same evidence.  He's the fucking guy.    Sir.    miguel.  May I? We really need your helpon this one.  And you do owe usfor getting ramon off.  I do.  But I can't very well charge mr.  King with assaulton a palm tree.  You have your ways,miguel.  You've bent rules before.  Getting people lostin the system.  We need to buy timefor anton briggs.  For you.  I'll do everythingin my power.  We'll be right there.  Showtime.  Dex, get your kit.  You too, masuka.    Hey, it's called off duty.    Not anymore.  You two, you stay on king.  Don't let up.  We got another body.  Anton? A female at the cemetery.    Cause of death?   Take your pick.  Sever beating,strangulation plus three stab wounds.  Whoever did thiswas not a fan.  You have no idea.  Think our killer's a pro.  I haven't seen many body dumpsthis clean.  I made sure of that.  Miguel getting caughtisn't part of the lesson plan.  angel, don't let her see this.  no, they said it was her.  But it's not, is it? Maria, I'm sorry.  No, I don't believe    oh, my god.    Walk with me.  Too many people are affectedwhen the innocent die.  That is partof the lesson plan.  No one is untouchable.  I learned that the hard way.  So will miguel.  His own vulnerability is aboutto become very real to him after the stage show ends.    They won't find anything.    I know.  So you're just makinga point.  Am I? We follow the code.  Or else.  There are a lotof other subtleties, but if that'swhat you've gleaned, then yeah,that's my point.  You're a wise person,aren't you?   You're being facetious.    No, no, you have insight.  I'd be a foolnot to follow your lead.  I thinkyou're gonna save my life.  Is this real? I should go make a statementto the press.  I wouldn't want anyone gettingideas about killing lawyers.  Lesson learned.  It seems.  Oh, good.  Good.  You're here.  Come here.  Taste this.  This one.  And now this one.  Which one? I'm more in the moodfor steak.  No, this isfor the wedding cake.  We have to choose one.  Chocolate or hazelnut? Is sylvia still here? No, because of me.  I intervened.  Apparently,I'm a very wise person.  Apparently? According to miguel.  He came to the open house I was sitting for syl.    Really?   We we talkedfor a while.  Actually, I talked.  I just I gave himsome insight.  Insight.  He said he thinksI could Save his life.  Every word, bullshit.  When did he start lying? With ellen? Before her? So, chocolate? What about that shirt? The shirt.  Dexter, what's wrong? I have to lookat some blood.  Evidence.  For a crime.  Hazelnut.  Maria, why don't you head home,get some rest? I can'T.  I have to   do something.    Sure.  I'm here if you need me.  Okay? Tell me that we're closeon the skinner.  'Cause this ellen wolf thingis about to take over.  Still running down tips,but they're bullshit so far.  They're gonna keep beingbullshit because no one saw king take anton.  What about mario astorga? As tight lippedas king.  Maybe I can help.  She could use a winright now.  we all could.  You gonna charge king? Not with what you have.  We release him,he's in the wind.  Anton's dead.  So has king askedfor legal counsel yet? King knowswe have nothing on him.  Why would he wastethe money? Well, technically,if he's not represented, I can't walk in there and offer him any deals.  Not on the record,anyway.  Come on.  No one'll know the difference.  still a year from now, the recorded document shows upon cnn, uh uh.  Actually, that camera's beenon the fritz.  It wouldn't surprise meif it didn't record anything.  Freebo's blood.  The link between his murderand miguel.  If I go down,I can take miguel with me.  Mutual assurance.  A symbol of trust.  Fuck.  That's it? No way we're gonna letthat monster walk.  Are we? I hope we meet again.  I'd like to getto know you better.  But how wellcan you really know someone? How muchdo you want to know? There's gotta be something.  All we got is mario, who won't say shit.  I mean, we can start skinninghim ourselves before he'd talk.  Morgan,we're not skinning mario.  I got a better idea.  Wanna sharewith the whole class? No, just you.  I need a partner on this.  Here we are.  Home sweet home.  It's too badanton won't ever get to do that.  Thanks to you.  What? los arboles.  Holy shit.  You told him I revealed things? We didn't tell him shit.  He knew you were in holding.  He must have thoughtyou caved.  I didn't tell anyoneanything.  Look, I'm sorry.  We didn't mean to getyour family caught up in this,all right? We'll do everything we canto help you.  What can you do? Nothing.  You're right.  We don't even knowwhere this guy is.  You gotta help me, or I can't doanything to help you.  Then that's it.  I'm sorry.  Wait! He has a building.  We wentthrough all of his holdings.  There's no record of himowning any building.  He rents it with cash.  He had me go thereand pay once.    He's trying to grow trees to sell.    Where? On 164th under the highway.  It's all I know.  Mi familia.  Go inside.  Lock the door.  I'll send a patrol car.  Go.    It worked.  Get in.    Thank you.  Anton! Anton, are you in there? Anton? Fuck restraint.  Here.  Morgan! Get out of the way.  It's me.  It's okay.  You're safe.  I need an ambulance at the 164 and the 94 asap.  Get an apb outon george king.  You found me.  You found me.  You can't get away from methat easily.  And the results are I, uh Come on.  I'll take you home.  I can't go home.  There's too much silence.  I know.  You don't want to have to thinkabout what she went through.    Only to realizethat she's really gone.    Don'T.    Pero, corazon, she's gone.    Don'T.  Okay? And that's gonna hurt like hell.  I know that too.  But you have friends.  You got me.  I'm right here.  Okay? I'm right here for you.  To get you through.  It's not freebo's blood.  It's not even human.  It's bovine.  Cow's blood.  He's been using methe whole time.  I didn't create a monster;I was used by one.  He used me.  Miguel! Nine holes tomorrow? You bet.  today I keep up the pretense.  But soon,maybe tomorrow, miguel will knowexactly how I feel.  Because finally there's anemotion I don't have to fake.  Today,I feel something real.

When you've been married as long as we have, You know when your husband's lying.  Anton is not officially a c. i.  We used him as bait.  The skinner has anton.  Freebo owes you money? I can get you money.  I loaned freebo that money.  This is about respect.  Anton! Morgan, get out of the way! You found me.  You can't get away from me that easily.  Anton could so easily file a huge lawsuit Against the police department once he finds out how you fucked him over! You don't know what the fuck you're talkin' about!

I didn't create a monster.  I was used by one.  Heusedme.  How many was it seven or eight balls? I lost count.  Putting the 18th tee in front of a body of water Is criminal.  I kept on telling him \"take the mulligan! Please take the mullig  \" This one right here   no.  I finally got one over didn't i? yeah.  Just what I ordered   Feigned civility with a heaping side of betrayal.  It's becoming more and more clear That I'm going to have to deal with miguel.  Thank you, chef.  Ah, chef babia.  Option one  i kill him.  But he's too high profile.  A popular ada disappears.  the manhunt would be endless.  Everyone he knew would be scrutinized, And that includes me.  He's also my best man.  I'd be expected to grieve.  How about this pumpkin and sage ravioli here? Oh, no, that's   There you go.  Option two  get him the hell out of my life.  But it's not that simple.  He taught me how to golf.  I taught him how to kill.  I'm responsible if miguel takes another innocent life.  Tell them   miguel.  I can't wait.  Tell us? We got a wedding present for you.  Chef babia and his staff, They're gonna cater your wedding.  We wanted you to have the very best.  It's too much.  really.  I won't take no for an answer.  You might have to.  We're doing this for you.  I insist.  So much for option two.  He won't just let our partnership dissolve.  He's trying to get me under his thumb, And he's using rita to do it.  No You are the very best man.  It's working.  Okay, two, a toast.  To dexter and rita.  May your marriage be as blessed As we are to have you to call friends.  Which leaves option three.  Get him under my thumb And keep him there.  God, wre barely moving.  So much for getting astor home in time r bath.  At least the meal was worth it.  And it was great to see sylvia and miguel getting along again.  Do wehave to serve food at the wedding? Yes.  We have to serve food at the wedding.  It's just   if we can't afford Chefwhat's his name on our own, Maybe we shouldn't accept.  We can't say no now.  I mean it would be insulting.  Believe me   miguel's ego can handle it.  What's going on dexter? It's just Miguel isn't exactly who I thought he was.  You two seemed to be getting along fine at dinner.  Yeah Wait a minute.  Is this about sylvia? I mean   did you find something out? More than I wanted to.  Oh   my god.  he's cheating on her.  No   that's not what i   Oh, that bastard! He looked me right in the eye And he said he wasn't having an affair.  Oh, godpoor syl.  How long has it been going on? Should I tell her? what would I say? I think we should juststay out of it.  Is it his secretary? It's not his secretary! Could we please just drop this?   But there is someone.   I never said that.  All right   syl said that miguel's been Spending a lot of time with maria laguerta, Which makes syl uncomfortable Because they have this big history.    Is that true?  yes.  Then that's who it is.

I need leverage.  Exposing ellen's body was supposed to achieve that.  But miguel wrestled it away.  We have a suspect for ellen wolf's murder.  Is she onto miguel and do I smell leverage? Toby edwards, 32.  Oh, well.  Ellen's incoming phone records show That he called her house three times On the night of her murder   once at 11:10 p. m.  From the bar where he works, And then twice more at 3:01 and 3:08 a. m.  From right outside her house.  She hasn't found the killer, But she might have found a witness.  And I found my leverage.  Soderquist, vamos.  Get an address on this guy.  haul his ass in.  We're also getting a search warrant.  We're looking for a platinum wedding ring.  I've already catalogued one wedding ring into evidence.  Well, she wore two.  One for each ex husband.  Well   why would the killer only take one ring? Maybe he got interrupted.  Or he wanted a trophy.  Whatever it is we're gonna find out.  A potential witness, a missing ring.  Now miguel and I have something to talk about.  Hey   not so fast.  not so fast.

I can't remember.  He couldn't have seen anything.  You sure? All right.  so what do we do? We? ha.  We are partners.  Yeah   but see here's the thing, miguel.  I don't really want a partner.

What can I do you for? I   uh   need you to test this for blood.  If it comes back positive, Run it through the criminal database.  No prob.  Might take a day or two for sequencing.  Uh, grease it.  I mean   it's it's a priority.  Sure.  Thanks.  Is this ellen wolf or the skinner? There's no case number.  uh, it's It's more of an internal thing.  You know? my eyes only.  Your eyes only.  Thanks.  I'm not hiding anything.  I swear.  You were coming on to ellen.  I was there.  She came on to me.  I flirted back.  It's part of the job you know? How you earn tips.  She left me 20 on a $30 tab.  You figured there was more where that came from.  You called her again At 11:10 p. m.  then at 3:01 and 3:08 a. m.  That's pretty late to be calling someone you just met.  I called on my break.  I told her I didn't get off work till after 2:00.  She said to come over anyway.  And then I called again To tell her I wasn't going to make it.  She didn't answer.  I called one more time just in case.  No one picked up.  For someone so innocent he sure looks guilty.  Looks like a killer to me.  He's not.  Well, but he could be.  You wanna know what I think happened? I think that you showed up at her house unannounced, Looking for sex.  She wouldn't give it up and you lost your temper.  That's not what happened.  And then you called twice To make it look like you thought she was still alive.  That's crazy.  you're not listening to me.  Any priors? You seem to have a problem with the word innocent.  No one's gettin' framed for this.  Hey, your ball game.  Why are you here? Curiosity.  You can't blame me can you? So you didn't go over to her house? No.  I went home.  You're fucking lying, toby.  These two calls were routed through a cell phone tower A block away from her house.  You were there   All right! I have a fiancee Who's not gonna like hearing about a booty call.  So you went there.  she changed her mind.  You got angry   no.  no! I mean   yes I went to her place, But she didn't answer the door.  So I called  twice.  I figured she fell asleep.  I went home.  I swear to god.    Not much of a suspect.    not much of a witness.  Lieutenant do you have a second? Hmm.  new development.  Never know what'll pop up.  Welli'll know.  I'll keep you posted as promised.  You're a good friend to have.  I'm just gonna stay here.  My curiosity's piqued.  He's lying through his teeth.  We can put him at the scene.  He's   uh not our guy.  The fuck he's not.  Four people put him at the bar all night long.  And there's security camera footage of him closing out When the vic went down.  The vic's name is ellen and he was there.  He's our guy.  The time code on the tape checks out.  I'm sorry, lieutenant.  You were there at 3:00 in the morning.  Did you see anyone else on the street? No.  it was dead.  No unusual activity? There was some douche bag with his high beams on.  Blinding me.  So someone was on the street.  He was coming the other direction when I pulled up.  Actually it wasn't high beams.  It was those big ass halogens.  What kinda car? Suv.  Dark.  blue.  Black   i i i don't know! Something like that.  I am indeed a good friend to have.  And one can never have too many friends, right? My friend miguel isn't giving up without a fight.  He'll do whatever's necessary to regain the upper hand.  If he controls laguerta he controls the investigation, And my leverage disappears.  But she's a tough sell.  he won't get far.  I hope.  You Are so Beautiful! All right.  Now   you come over here and admire yourself While nina checks the fit.  I feel like cinderella.  Except for the whole disney virgin thing.  Oh, don't worry.  No one'll know prince charming knocked ya up before the ball.  Hey, syl, are you okay? Yeah.  I was just remembering my wedding day.  I was never happier.  It's supposed to get even better over time.  Sweetie   your marriage will, I'm sure of it.  Things still aren't great with miguel? Well   we're working on it.  At least I am.  And what's he doing? Wish I knew.  Do youreally? What the hell are you doing in here? Forensics? On which case? The new bean counter is questioning this lab request.  What is this key that you're testing? It's, uh It's for an investigation.  Then put an active case number on it, okay? With all these budget cuts, They're flagging everything and coming straight to me With all this bullshit Which I really don't need right now, dexter.  I don't need it.  Okay.  I'll straighten it out.  I'm sorry.  I just   No.  I'll take care of it.  She's ripe for the picking and miguel knows it.  He'll use her to protect himself.  And there goes my leverage.  Better keep an eye on her.  No   no   no   no.  y you can't cancel.  The party's in two days.  You're sorry? Well   you can take your sorry and shove it up your ass! Fuck! The erotic clowns just cancelled.  Why is this wedding happening to me? Bro   let me help ya out.  I've been the best man At more weddings than I can count.  Never a groom thank christ, But I've planned a ton of these.  \"platinum enterprises\"? It's a full service operation, Party boat   food alcohol.  One phone call and you're done.  Ask for tammy.  God bless you joseph quinn.  Hey.  he lives.  Hey, man.  Good to see you up and moving, man.  Thanks   thanks   um morgan, she here? Ah, no, she's out.  Running down a file On the bastard who did this to you.    We're gonna find him anton, I swear.    yeah, I know.  Hey, I just wanted to say I never meant for any of this to go down The way it did, you know? You didn't sign up for this.  Hey   listen   I was the idiot who got busted In the first place right? so It's kind of on me.  Yeah   but it was me thinking I was doing you a favor Keeping you off the books.  Should have told you you were free and clear.  I messed up.  I wanted to apologize to your face.  Deb told me that was a clerical error.  That was you? Yeah.  I assumed she told you.  You lying son of a bitch! You almost got me killed! Shit! It's all right.  let him go.  What the hell is this? Ramos   let him go.  let him go! This shit ain't over, man.  Anton You okay? Yeah.  Anton, stop.  Goddamn it will you just stop? His punk ass deserved it! You can't just walk into a police station and punch a cop! Here you are standin' up for him.    I am not the enemy here.    debra, you lied to me! Clerical error, my ass.  Quinn kept me As his c. i.  bitch When I could have walked away at any time.  You're right, I lied.  But telling you wasn't gonna change what he did.  I almost died because of that prick.  Without that prick we wouldn't have found you.  You're lucky if he doesn't press charges.  What? let him! I'll sue this whole fucking department! Don't talk like that.  I'll talk to quinn.  Really.  Are you sure you're not afraid He might find out we're sleeping together And tell everyone? He already knows and he hasn't told anyone.  And where the hell did that come from? From your brother's surprised face when he met me, debra.  From your boot on my butt Kicking me out the door this morning.  Are you serious? I am this close to getting my shield, And I'm putting it all at risk to be with you! Then debra, why are you? You feel guilty? You feel responsible for what happened to me? Shit.  you're bleeding.  You're gonna need new stitches.  Debra, I tell you what I'm gonna need.  I need for you to seriously Think about this.  Think about us.  No, no, para mi, no.  I think I've had enough.  Wineinvented for the sole purpose Of handling grief.  Believe me, I know.  When oscar died I drowned my share of sorrow.  I know how you feel.  you miss her.  Justjust Last thursday, I was having drinks with her.  And then the next day, I'm staring down at her dead body.  If you're gonna end up in a grave, It should at least be your own.  And so the only thing you got to go on right now Is that suv, huh? We're checking every Intersection surveillance camera From ellen's place to the cemetery.  Good.  good.  Thorough.  See, she's lucky to have you watchin' out for her.  It's just like you watched out for me with oscar's case.  Some good that did.  Hey, maria, come on.  You helped me.  You helped me.  You've always been important to me.  You know that.  You remember that weekend when we took oscar with us To the keys? I kept telling him \"i am not sharing The hottest girl in florida with my baby brother. \" And then you talked me into letting him come.  He was so cute.  Those skinny little legs.  mm hmm.  Up until that weekend, He was always my annoying kid brother, you know? Always in the way.  And then when he was taken from me, I kept on thinking back to that weekendyou know? 'cause that's the way I wanna remember him, Like you said.  You know before all the drugs And all the run ins with the cops and all that.  That little boy with the skinny legs, My brother.  Sorry.  I wouldn't have had that memory if it wasn't for you.  Seriously.  Thank you.  Gracias.  I miss that.  Oh, man, I don't know what came over me.  It's okay.  it's okay.  Hey, lieutenant, I am sorry to show up unannounced.  I know it's late, But I feel so bad about that case number screw up, And I just wanted to   Miguel.    I'm interrupting    no, we're just, um   Casework.    talking casework.  If this was so urgent, dexter you could have called me.  I know, I'm sorry.  it's just I feel bad and this is too important.  The key I tested came from a colleague In monroe county.  His department doesn't have our resources, And I did him a favor.  I'm sorry.  I know how you value the truth.  Look, don't worry about it.  Just let me know next time.  Okay.  And call first.  Again, I'm sorry to interrupt.  I couldn't let laguerta become miguel's collateral damage.  I need to keep his focus on me.  After tonight I have his full attention.  Hey, there.  Please don't hate me, But i i may have done a bad thing.  Do I need to sit down? I told sylvia about miguel and laguerta.  I'm gonna sit down.  I was trying on my dress.  We were talking about the wedding.  She seemed so sad.  I mean, I had to say something, didn't i? I suppose you did.  So she called miguel's office and his assistant said That he was meeting with lieutenant laguerta, But then syl checked with your precinct, And neither of them is there.  Soshe thinks miguel is at laguerta's? What do you think she's gonna do? I'll call you tomorrow hmm? About the case? Sure.  at the office.  Maria You fucker! You are too good a liar, miguel.  Syl, what are you doing here? I don't know when you're telling the truth anymore.  You say you're at work.  I believe you.  You say you're not having an affair.  I believe you.  Syl, nothing happened here, okay? I swear to you.  you swore to me last thursday When you were out all night.  You swore to me you weren't with another woman.  But now I think you were here.    Wait.  last thursday he was not    you You'll probably be a lot better At seeing through his bullshit than I was, Being a detective and all.  Good luck.  syl, come on, ven.  Don't touch me.  I'm done! Syl.  Get out of my life! She  she's got it all wrong.  I'll straighten it out.  all right? Hey, francisco! What'll it be today, mr.  morgan? I said you'd take the usual.  You're a creature of habit.  Come on, take a seat.  while you wait.  Kind of a bitch move there, man.  Sending my wife over to maria's.  Surprisingly it wasn't me.  Sure.  You wouldn't play games with a man's family, Or, uh Cause pain to an innocent woman.  Neither would i.  That's why I wanted to give you a heads up That my office is thinking about doing A little ethics probe on your sister.  Cops don't come any cleaner than deb.  Yeah, huh? Like, uh, sleeping with a c. i. ? 'cause it's all here in this surveillance report For what's his name.  I got it right here.  \"anton briggs. \" Now, mi'jito this don't look so good.  Pero I'm gonna keep a close eye on it Just like you're gonna keep a close eye On ellen's case for me.  And any other favor I might have.  The usual, mr.  morgan.  Here.  It's a copy.  'cause after all Familia is sacred.  Right? He has no idea what door he just opened.  Mr.  dexter.  Hey, norma.  The prados they're not home.  That's what I was hoping.  Did you know that miguel Is gonna be best man for my wedding? Yeah.  I heard him talking about it with mrs.  sylvia.  Well   the groom is supposed to buy his best man a gift.  And I know how much miguel loves garcia marquez, So I thought I'd pick up A limited edition of one of his books.  He would like that very much.  Do you think it'd be all right if I looked in miguel's den Just to see what he already has? Our secret? Okay.  Come in.  I'll be out in a jiffy.  Okay.  Miguel stepped over a line and he'll keep stepping Until I have something he can't top, Something that could put him in jail, If and when I want him there.  That's the only way he'll back off.  I know miguel killed ellen wolf.  And I know he took one of her rings as a trophy.  The question is where did he hide it? Somewhere no one else would ever look.  Unless Unless they're me.  No more games.  Hi.  are you vince? Yeah I'm tammy okama.  platinum enterprises.  May I sit? Yeah, sure.  You're tammy? I was expecting someone   Trashy?   yeah.  That's sweet.  So! we are planning a bachelor party.  Yeah   but   uh keep it down, Because party boy's in the next room.  We have any number of themes you can choose from.  What's your favorite? Mm.  I'd stick with a nautical theme.  Riverboat casino.  pirates in petticoats.  Nautical's good.  Mm hmm.  you have such nice eyes, vince.  Hey   dex   I got your message.  Did you get a dna match on that key? Uh, seems so.  Thank you.  I mean it.  So where's the report? If angel wants to kill this guy that's his business.  I'm done getting involved with friends.  I heard   uh   laguerta gave you shit for this.  It's all right.  But i i knew that I could trust you.  Don't get involved.  I heard about detective gianna.  How is she? What are you doing? Okay.  no concussion.  Dex, the  the file.  I know how hard it must have been To see her like that.  I know what it is to Wanna rebalance an unbalanced world.  But it's just Unbalanced   angel and that's it.  Some doors should stay shut.  You open it   it's too easy to walk through it a second time.  I've seen it before.  recently, even.  I'll keep it in mind.  Thanks, dex.  Well   at least I didn't teach him How to get away with murder.  I'm learning.  Thought you said You'd be gone by the time I got back.  I'm just getting some work stuff here.  Just make sure you get everything.  I don't want you using it as an excuse to come back.  Syl, look, i   Damn it! Please, sir, This stain just wouldn't come out.  You know   once blood sets it's really hard to get out, So no charge.  Devon parks? Hey, deb, I wanted to talk to you about the thing you got going With your c. i.  Well, he's not a c. i.  And we don't have anything going, not anymore.  Well that settles that.  Only a retard would have gotten involved with anton In the first place.  I don't know.  He seemed like a nice enough guy.  You seemed to like him.  When he went missing all I could think was, \"please   god don't let him be dead. \" And then I get him back, And all I can think is How wrong he is for me.  You know   like how bad it makes me look.  Doesn't matter that he makes me happy Or he makes me feel how you're supposed to feel When you're with the right person.  Is that crazy? I got nothin'.  God.  You are useless.  Love you anyway.  Think this is funny? Not at all.  They said that stain would come out! Fuck you! I didn't get to where I am, Who I am by letting some little gusano like you Walk all over me!   Where's my ring?   it's not your ring.  it's ellen's.  But you did leave a nice, clean print on it.  Oh   there's plenty of blood on your hands too! Ethan turner clemson galt.  All deserving With nothing to tie me to their deaths And no bodies to prove that they're even dead.  Maybe in a court of law.  But how's that little bride of yours gonna feel When she has to start answering some questions? 'cause she's gotta wonder where you go, What you do, who you really are.  She knows everything she needs to, And it's gonna stay that way Or that ring might show up someplace very inconvenient.  I am the last person you wanna fuck with, Because I will fuck you back In ways you never even imagined! An anonymous tip couple of search warrants.  Hmm? who knows what the police might find in your apartment Or in that little boat of yours.  You got the ring.  I got city fucking hall! Wow.  I didn't get it before, miguel, But you can't be reasoned with guilted, controlled.  This whole back and forth game for leverage is pointless.  That's right! I'll do what I want when I want To whomever I want   count on it! I will.  Thank you.  Harry was right.  he's always been right.  There are the innocent and there are the deserving.  Have barbara gianna i. d.  this guy.  Some doors should stay closed.  Some people can understand that.  Harry also said it's all about choices.  Good and bad.  My search for connection always ends in blood.  You get a good look at him? Yes.  How do I know this is not a trap? Oye.  if I wanted you in jail, I wouldn't have let you loose in the first place, okay? You believe this man knows where freebo is? He's the only one who does His name? Dexter morgan.  You want freebo, You want your money Then you need to have a long conversation With him.  Even harry would agree miguel has left me no other choice.  As challenging as it will be it's back to option one.  I kill him.      Previous EpisodeNext Episode"

Premium alcohol, all you can eat buffet, plus high class adult entertainment.  Kill me now.  You guys, this is awesome.  No, no, that's fucking awesome!   Hey, ladies, what's going on?   Hi, sailor.  The best man arrives with his brother.  Designated driver or bodyguard? I'll find out later.  Right now, time to put on my party face.  Bachelor parties.  While I do understand the need for ritual, I've heard these events aren't really for the groom.  They're for everyone else.  I have plans to make for my own big day.  The day I kill miguel.  okay, okay, let's get the music down.  Okay, boys and girls! Put those packages away, please.  So as you all know, we're here to, uh, celebrate the impending marriage of our dear friend dexter.  And while my job as best man is to offer a few remarks, you're gonna have to forgive me for keeping them g rated, because I'm running for office after all.  Better run fast.  Dexter's a hard guy to get to know.  And for a smart guy, sometimes he doesn't have the good sense that god gave little chickens.  I mean, like this doughnut thing.  What's up with that? You bring doughnuts to work so that people can like you? Thanks for the diabetes and the clogged arteries, dexter.  I mean, why don't you just stab a pal in the ventricle, huh? But in all seriousness.  I, uh I wanna say a few words about friendship.  Friends are always honest with each other.  They can see past their differences.  When they have a conflict, friends are there to forgive.  A true friend knows when to bury the hatchet because friendship is a sacred bond built on trust.  And, dex, I have learned so much from you about, uh trust.  So, cono.  Hey, to dexter! I have to be at work in 45 minutes.  Maybe I can squeeze in a power nap and a quick shower.  Maybe not.  Good morning.  Look, bagels.  Soak up the alcohol.  Actually, I'm late for work.  How was it? I survived.  If you're wondering if I did anything stupid I didn'T.  Mmm, well, it must have been very tempting.  Very.  Syl told me she kicked out miguel.  How is he? Uh, I think he feels betrayed.  Why? He's the one who threw his marriage vows out the window.  Who does that?   A man without a code.    Exactly.  So.  What? Well, I mean, just   do you really want him standing beside you on the biggest day of our lives? Actually, no.  But I thought I should play nice until after the wedding.  Just think about it, okay? What is that? Oh, it's a, uh, hour by hour schedule for the day of.  There's hair and makeup for me.  Transportation, pictures, ceremony.  Things are bound to go wrong.  The less left to chance the better.    Wise words.    I'll make you a copy.  Great.  But can we talk wedding stuff later? I really gotta get in the shower.  You want some company? Yeah.  But I'm too late.  after last night, they all think we share a secret.  But miguel's the only one who knows mine.  I could tell the rest of them, but then I'd have to kill them.  Just like I'm going to kill miguel.  What am I, the morgan family punching bag? Thanks for not inviting me to dexter's party, you ass.  It was a bachelor party.  Dongs and gongs required.  Unless you wanna be talent.  In which case     gross, he's my brother.    Not by blood.  Oh, thank god.  My head.  Your head should be in the ellen wolf case, detective.  Let's review.  toby edwards.  Bartender/booty call.  Saw a black suv outside ellen wolf's place the night she died.  Miguel's black suv.  And the grid we set up, what did we get? jack diddly.  There's no traffic surveillance footage of any black suv between ellen's house and the cemetery where her body was found.  Maybe I could kill him in his car.  It has that big backseat.  Let's recanvass.  Somebody saw something, and we're gonna find them.  Next order of business.  The skinner.  George king.  The nicaraguan embassy is still giving me the runaround.  Ramos.  Go there in person.  Until we know king's true identity, there's not much to go on.  And finally, anton briggs is coming in today to go over his statement.  Today? What's the matter, you forget your lip gloss? quinn.  I want you to stay clear.  No more sparring.  And, morgan, I know he's your informant, but I wanna cover it.  Get myself up to speed with the case.  All right, people.  That's it.  Go, catch bad guys.  Fuck you, lip gloss.  No unusual activity? There was some douchebag with his high beams on, blinding me.  Actually, it wasn't high beams.  It was those big ass halogens.  What kind of car? Suv.  Dark, blue black.  Something like that.  LINCOLN, NAVIGATOR, SUV, BLACK Hola, miguel.  Mmm, asi, asi.  Yeah, listen, after that scene with syl the other night, I think we should talk.  That's great.  Get a 20 on anton briggs.  Have his uni watchdogs bring him in.  You always look so happy to see me.  It's 'cause I always am.  I brought you these.  Italian hangover remedies perfected by centuries of over indulging ancestors.  There's saffron lemon risotto, white pizza, cayenne tea.  Sounds great.  But I'm not hung over.  I behaved myself last night.  I'm a plus one now, remember? Still, man has his needs.  Trust me.  My needs are covered.  cold feet? What? No, rita's great.  Getting married's easy, dex.  All you have to do is show up.  But killing miguel prado? KILL PLAN FOR MIGUEL PRADO That'll require some finesse.  He's a public figure.  Well connected.  Dad, I got it.  Miguel dies, people notice.  Which means you can't just make him disappear.  So I'll pin it on someone else.  How about your timeline? Definitely after the wedding.  It'd be crazy to do it any sooner.  And an alibi? The wedding night.  Rita's pregnant, exhausted.  After our wedding and a glass of champagne, she'll be out like a light.  Unless she wakes up and you're not there.  That is not the way you want her to remember your wedding night.  Are you hiding or something? Anton will be here in a minute.  I don't wanna see him.  I know it's real mature, but if I see him, I'll just miss him.  So tell him.  I can'T.  I need to be with somebody who's got his shit together.  Somebody with a real job.  Somebody with strong morals.  Somebody like dad.  Dad wasn't perfect, deb.  Yeah, well, he wasn't a drug user or a C.  I.  Well, anton's not a C.  I.  Dad still wouldn't approve.  You'd be surprised.  What's that supposed to mean?   Nothing.    Something.  You've had a bug up your ass about dad for months now.  What did he do? You don't wanna know.  No, I really do.  He wasn't on the take.  He didn't break any laws.  He didn't cheat on mom.  Bullshit.  Yeah, you're right.  Bullshit! Who? A C.  I.  You always wanted to be like dad.  Seriously? Anton is here to go over his statement with you.  I thought you were covering this.  I was.  But you're the only one he trusts.  Well, it's really hard to find people that you trust these days.    Deb.    Blow me.  My sister never says that.  Oops.  Shit, this was a bad idea.  Send in the other guy.  What? It's pretty clear you don't wanna be here.  I'M sorry.  This is not about you.  I mean, it's about you.  It's just something else just happened.  Are you okay? No.  Can I help? You can take a look at this and see if there's anything that you wanna change or add   you know that's not why I'm here.  Right now I really need it to be.  What? Is there a mistake? No.  It's just, um these words, they don't really say it.  You know, what   what happened to me.  What do you mean? Debra, I could hear it, you know? The sound of the blade cutting into me.  That and, uh, the sound of me screaming.  Like it was somebody else.  And I remember thinking, \"that guy screaming he's gonna die. \" But, um, then he just stopped.  Why? To go through my pockets.  He took my wallet and my cell phone.  Cocksucker even took my change.  Your change? How fucked up is that? He give you anything? Nothing we can use.  Sure, we'll walk the crime scene.  See if there's anything we missed.  Whatever it takes to fucking catch this guy.  Please tell me you're not freezing sperm in there.  This only gets down to minus 40 degrees centigrade.  Freezing sperm requires a vessel to be at least minus 200.  What? I'm a donor.  It's my way of giving back.  God help the children.  Hey, um, is the, uh, server down? Why, what do you need? Um, I wanted to run a background check.  On who? Tammy okama.  You slept with her, didn't you? Vince masuka does not kiss and tell.  Okay, fine, I banged her.  And? AndWe just stayed up all night just   just talking.  So you like her? The problem is she likes me.  I mean, there's gotta be something wrong with her, right? Well, I'll let you know when the server's up.  if home is where the heart is, where do you go when you don't have a heart? In miguel's case, a five star hotel.  I used to know miguel's schedule inside and out.  After all, we were best friends.  But things change.  Now that syl kicked him out of the house, he has a new routine I need to learn.  Can I get my keys? I forgot something.  Oh, yeah, there you are, mr.  Prado.    Thank you.    Thank you.  Or I could wait for him to do something stupid.  Like ditching ramon.  You close to your father? No.  He was, uh, deadbeat trailer trash.  It's why I became a cop.  You got a rich mother or something? She died when I was five.  Why? The car, the watch.  Just wondering if you had a trust fund, or you were day trading, or something.  No.  I got an uncle in boston.  He died, left me a building.  Total surprise.  Family's are full of 'em.  Just wait till dexter's wedding.  Brings out the best and the worst.  Weddings kinda suck when you're single.  Single? I thought you and anton were   we're not.  Not anymore.  So, uh you wanna, you know, carpool? What? High gas prices, you know?   Are you hitting on me?   I'm sorry.    Hello?   Morgan.    Hello?   Hello? God damn it, fucking cell phone reception.  It's batista.  Probably wants a status update.  We should give it to him.  Hey, you have any change? I saw a payphone up the street.  Think so.  Motherfuck!   Holy jesus on a stick!   What? No cell phone reception.  That's why george king took anton's change.  To use that payphone.  We gotta dump the phone records.    Oye.    Si? I'm glad you called today.  I was surprised, but, uh, glad.  The last thing I wanted to do was put you in the middle of   maria, you gotta know that I've been thinking about us for a long time.  Way before ellen wolf, rest in peace.  'Cause, hey, what we had   we were different back then.  Really different.  So why is it every time I look at you I still feel the same way I felt when we first met?   Water's boiling.    Boiling, yes, ooh.  It's mi sopa.  And I got you some red stripe.  Oh, wow, great.  Somewhere.  Shit, I left it in the car.    Oh, I'll go get it.    No, no, no, no.  You stay and make sure it doesn't boil over.  Okay.  Miguel probably thinks he's getting lucky.  Looks like he's getting screwed.  They make a cute couple.  Too bad they're both lying through their teeth.  LIFTGATE/GLASS AJAR Don't go there, miguel.  You start thinking laguerta's on to you, you'll decide to do very bad things to another innocent person and I can't let that happen.  Things to do today: Find a non blowback way to dispose miguel's body.  I need you to run hair and fiber for me against all victims for the last ten days.  But I'm the blood guy.  Who also does forensics.  Who I trust to keep a confidence and the lab results off the record.  Well, keeping secrets is one of my strong suits, but I kinda got my head handed to me the last time I did some off the grid testing, by you.  This is different.  That was bureaucratic bullshit.  And this is, \"do as I say, not as I do\"? You ever get a voice inside nagging at you? I'm aware of the phenomenon.  Well, I'm hoping I'm wrong about this.  But if I am and anyone finds out, it'll bring a shit hurricane down on the entire department.  And if you're right? Same hurricane, different landfall.  Got it.  Either way, I need a raincoat.  No, I don't want you getting into any trouble over this.  Use my authorization code to make it happen.  Procedure aboveboard, results under the table.  You good with that? Absolutely.  If you need something under the table, I'm your guy.  That didn't come out right.  How soon before you can get back to me with this? A  s a P.  Accessing samples from homicides in the last ten days.  Fast tracked and confidential.  Authorization code requested.  Processing.  Approved.  You're the best.  I have to be.  muds and luds from that payphone.  George king was using it like an office line.  He called clients, he called workers, he ordered nicaraguan take out.    That doesn't help us.    Well, maybe it does.  I just got off the phone with some lady that he called up in new jersey.  She winters down here at coconut grove.  She just re hired george king to re landscape their lawn.    So   so he knows the place is empty.  You think he'd be using it to lay low? We got fuck all else.  Vince.  The server's back up, so I ran your girl.  Bad news.  She's got a rap sheet.  She rammed her car into someone else over a parking space.  Yeah.  Big fine, anger management.  That means she's got issues.  So she's not outta my league.  Happy to help.  Both caucasoid.  Evenly distributed pigment granules.  Same dye job.  In other words, both ellen wolf.  No news there.  Do I let laguerta in on this? But why stir up the hornet's nest? Miguel's going to get the justice he deserves soon enough.  Hey, dex.  Too late to bring a date to the wedding? No, rita's still collecting rsvps.  What you working on? I, uh, found a gray hair.  I was curious.  Oh, dude, I've totally done that.  You're bald.  Maybe we should call for backup? Let's see what we got first.  Someone took the jungle cruise at magic kingdom.  Creeping mother of mary! Door.  Fuck, there he is.  Go around front.  Requesting all units, 931 harbor drive.  Fuck! Fuck! Jesus, quinn, are you okay? Officer down.  931 harbor drive.  Requesting an ambulance, also air surveillance of our 20.  What's this? Dexter, I need to see you for a minute.  You found the hair analysis results? Sorry, it   you were out, and they were just sitting there, and I really needed to know what came back.  So.  Now you know.  Question is, what are you gonna do? It's complicated.  I understand complicated.  Maybe I can help.  Okay.  You're close with miguel prado, and so am I, which is what makes this very difficult.  What's this gotta do with miguel? Ellen wolf was threatening to wreck his career.  Well, he has a black suv and no alibi for the night she died.  You think miguel had something to do with her murder? I found this sample in the back of his car.  I told you this was complicated.  Dexter.  I need your word this stays between us.  Yeah, you have it.  No wonder all the secrecy.  I'm assuming there's no chain of custody on this? I'll go to a judge for a warrant.  Get evidence through proper channels.  Which will tip off miguel and put laguerta in his crosshairs.  You really think a judge is gonna issue a warrant against a well respected officer of the court without probable cause? I don't know, dexter.  And I can't do nothing.  Not after these results.  Maybe you could sit on it.  For a while.  Let miguel think he got away with murder.  It'd give you time to build a solid case.  I've got some serious soul searching to do.  Take as long as you need.    Thanks for your help, dexter.    Yeah.  While laguerta's deciding, I'll be eliminating her problem.  And george king's going to help me.  I'll copy his M.  O.  They won't even look for another suspect.    What happened?   king.  I told him to go home, but he's hell bent on proving he has cajones of steel.    You good?   Superficial cut.  Let's keep moving.  All right, get me your report as soon as you can.  The brass is gonna be asking questions.  We had aerial surveillance, a security perimeter, at least 50 officers.  It's like george king is a ghost.  Sorry, sarge.  I'm not.  I need king out there long enough to peg miguel's murder on him.  How long have you known? About dad and his C.  I.  Uh, couple of weeks.  Camilla told me right before she died.    I didn't know if I should     tell me? Yes, whenever you have an earth shattering, ball crushing, mind fuck of a secret, you should tell your fucking sister.  Sorry.  You can get that now.  Rita wants to know if you're bringing anton to the wedding.  Bad timing.  No, I'm not bringing him.  Quinn sort of asked if I would go as his date.  But as much as I'll hate going stag to my own brother's wedding, being quinn's date depresses me even more.  He seems okay.  Yeah, he's fine.  On paper he's a cop.  Good career.  Like dad.  Yeah.  Well, it seems I don't know dad as well as I thought I did.  Turns out I'm just as big a fuck up as he was.  You're not a fuck up.  You're the hardest working person I know.  You're loyal to a fault.  In all the years I've known you, you've never let me down.  You should be my best man.  What? Miguel is your best man.  He's not even a good man.  I shoulda asked you in the first place.  So why didn't you? I don't know.  I thought the best man was supposed to be a man.  But I trust you more than anyone.  That's way more important.  You better not be doing this because you feel guilty.  Would you just stand up for me? Abso fucking lutely.  Long time.  Too busy with that new boyfriend of yours to come down and talk shit with me? What? Word travels.  Well, not fast enough.  We broke up.  Hey, fuck him.  His loss.  Yeah, well I kinda need a favor.  That's what I'm here for.  What you need? All the records you have on my dad's confidential informants.  Your dad? I know it's a big dig, but I just need the female C.  I. 'S.  And probably just the attractive ones.  Someone said something to you about harry and one of his C.  I. 'S? His attractive female C.  I. 'S? Why, you know something? What I know is, your dad wouldn't be the first cop to fuck around on his wife.  Look, I know you have a lot of requests, but   but nothing.  My dad stepped out on my mom.  Woulda cut off his dick if I coulda.  I'll put a rush on it.  Thank you.  Miguel's a night owl and a newly minted bachelor.  No way he's in bed this early.  are you kidding me? I'm not going to sleep.  The way the prados are knocking them back, they're not going anywhere soon.  Just as well.  I have some stalking to do.    Hotel belvedere.    Miguel prado, please.  Yes, sir.  I'll connect you right away.  Got it.    Excuse me.    Si? Could I get turndown service? Room 138.  Thanks.  Hello? Yeah.  I'm sorry, you're breaking up.  Can I call you back on a landline? Okay, bye.  I'm sorry, that's my boss.  Can you come back later? Oh, si.    Gracias.    De nada, senor.  I can park right there.  Use this as my point of entry and make the grab.  I'm in and out undetected.  A life vest? Shit.  He's been back to that hardware store.  He's planning to kill again.  Fucking miguel and his innocent victims.  That's why he's at the bar.  Get ramon blackout drunk so miguel can claim he was here the whole time.  Tonight's the night.  Maria? Lieutenant, dexter here.  Hey, I came across something you'll be interested in.  Kinda has to do with the whole miguel prado, ellen wolf thing you wanted me to look at.  You there? We should meet.  I'll be at the rising moon cafe at 91st and channel at 8:00 P.  M.  I'll try your cell.    Jesus!   finally.  No, no, no, no, man.  Oh, god.  Maria.  Okay.  Okay, okay, I   I know I   I crossed the line here.  I know that now.  It doesn't have to come to this.  But it always does.  I had higher hopes for you.  For us.  But I finally just have to accept it.  I'll always be alone.  That's not true.  You talking truth? That's good.  You actually had me believing I could have a friend, 'cause I swallowed your bullshit.  It wasn't bullshit! I tried.  I tried to crack that damn armor of yours.  Because I saw the possibility.  I still see the possibilities.  So this is my fault for being a shutdown? No, I just want you to let me in.  Why the fuck would I do that now? Because I know you.  Dexter, I know you better than anyone else.  No, there've been quite a few who've seen the real me as they laid on that table.  You're all just unchecked versions of myself.  What I would have become without my father's code.  They deserved it! I'm not like them! You are.  Admit it.    I'm like you.    No, no, no, no, no, no.  I know I'm a monster.  I accept you.  I accept you, dexter, like a brother.  I killed my brother.  I killed yours too.  Oscar? You? I didn't plan to, but it was kill or be killed.  You! You killed oscar! What did you say in your bachelor party speech? \"Friends are always honest. \" Friends forgive.  Friends forgive.  But I don't forgive you.  And I don't get to have friends.  You little freak! You think I'm done with you? You think this ends here? It doesn't! It does for you.  Adios, amigo.      Previous EpisodeNext Episode"

Several patches of skin removed from the   uh   The shoulder area.  Ligature marks on the neck.  Why the fuck would the skinner wanna kill miguel prado? Miguel was after freebo.  King had to figure he knew something.  We all react in different ways to death.  Some  like ramon  choose anger.  Others cling to ritual.  Dex.  I know he was your friend.

I have no intention of ignoring him.  I can use the ring to tie miguel to ellen wolf's murder Threaten to destroy Ramon's sainted brother's reputation forever.

Gail brandon.  Future mother In Law.  While i'm waiting i may as well check into my new partner.  Sergeant whitaker's in the field.  Would you like to leave a message? This is sort of important.  I'm with miami metro homicide.  You think you can track him down? Please hold.  Before she left michigan rita bennet would have been Ritabrandon.  Ackerman.  Paul bennet wasn't her first husband.  She was married before at 16.  Ending in divorce six months later.  An impetuous teen marriage.  Which makes me her third husband.  The charm.  The brass is giving us a blank check As far as overtime is concerned Until this man is in custody.  Jorge orozco.  A. K. A.  George king.  Affectionately known back home as the blade.  Orozco was a captain In the resistencia nicaraguense.  The contras.  He headed an interrogation unit.  He tortured people for a living.  And killed 'em.  Now this already was a big case.  With miguel prado's murder It's officially huge.  This is whitaker.  Hi   my name is dexter morgan.  I'm trying to track down your old partner ramon prado.  Why? I'm a family friend.  Sara told me he's been missing since his brother's funeral.  I figured with his problem and all Gotcha.  Actually   i haven't seen him since he left.  I know a few places he used to hang out at.  I mean   basically any bar within a ten Mile radius.  I can give you a few of his favorites   if you like.  I'm sure sara would appreciate that.  Yeah i'm sure.  I'd love to help them with george king But i've got a more pressing situation to deal with.  Miguel's wounded messenger.  Morgana minute? Sure   sarge.  So it took a couple of months and a lot of wrangling But my budget request finally came through.  Homicide is gonna get a little extra money.  Oh   that's great.  Mm Hmm.  We should get one of those crime Sight imagers.  Have you seen 'em? Their pictures are amazing.  Really? I mean   that's what you'd spend it on? 'Cause i was thinking maybe we'd spend it on Adding another detective to our squad.  Maybe somebody who saved the life of a c. I.  Who id'd our skinner.  I don't know what to say   i mean   wow.  Thank you.  I put in the recommendation to lieutenant laguerta.  She's just gotta sign the paperwork.  Oh   fuck.  Thank you   thank you.  We could use it a little joy around here.  Good work.  Thank you.  I got it.  I'm guessing \"it\" is something good? My detective shield.  Oh   big news.  It's gigantic news.  All laguerta has to do is sign the papers and i'm golden.  Well   i'm silver.  We should celebrate.  Yeah   come on.  I mean later.  I gotta pick up the kids   go to the tailor's Oh   yeah   yeah.  You know   dad would be proud.  That still means something   no matter how flawed he was.  Yeah   look at us.  You're getting married.  I'm making detective.  The morgans are gonna be all right.  I'll see you at the rehearsal dinner.  Okay.  Yo   francis.  Any progress on my dad's c. I.  Files? Ooh   he knew a lot of folks   i'll give him that.  Anyone of interest?

Dexter.  I need a word.  City council has voted to name the freeway interchange Near my house after miguel prado.  I drive that way every single day.  He was a hero.  To some.  He was a cold Blooded killer.  He murdered my friend   and now he's got an interchange? I'm sorry.  I'm sorry   You're the only other person who knows the truth.  Maybe it's time we let others in on the secret.  There is nothing to link miguel To ellen wolf's murder Except evidence that was obtained illegally And therefore inadmissible.  I'll find something.  I'll tear his life apart if i have to.  He doesn't have a life anymore.  It's his family you'd have to tear apart.  The community.  The cuban community.  And you still might not be able to prove anything.  So i just keep it a secret.  I hate secrets.  We all have them.  Well   then tell me   dexter.  How am i supposed to live with this? You just do.  Can i get an everything burrito and a side of beans Maybe a little bit of   Anton.  Hey.  Hi.  You're here.  Yeah.  Yeah   i was just   um   picking up some things from evidence.

Oh   but   Looks like i'm gonna get my detective shield.  Debra   wow   that's great.  Thank you.  Congratulations.  That's good.  That's good.  You wanna get some co   I should probably go.  Okay.  I'll see ya.  I'll see you.  I stopped at four bars   got a new appreciation For how many alcoholics there are in miami.  But still no ramon.  Morgan.  What's up? I just found out from the a. D. A. 'S office That they're requesting logs From the anton briggs surveillance detail.  Now   i didn't know why until i read 'em.  You slept with our key witness? The a. D. A. 'S looking into it? Miguel prado was.  I don't know what the status of it is now.  But it's a conflict.  And you should have given me the heads up.  Especially before i sent My recommendation to laguerta for your shield.  You're gonna spike it now? Laguerta has final say.  But she deserves full disclosure.  Disclosure? Really   sarge? Did you disclose that you met gianna Because you were out strolling for a hooker? Where did you hear that? I   Where'd you hear that? I know someone in vice.  I'm the only one that knows   i think.  It's not even that big of a deal.  Fuck   fuck! I am sorry.  I'm sorry.  It's just my chickens coming home to roost.  Oh   fuck.  Fuck.  I met detective gianna While seeking the comfort of prostitutes.  'Scuse me? I propositioned her.  She revealed to me to be police.  She had mercy on me; she let me off with a warning.  It was a dark time for me.  I completely understand if you wanna pursue a case against me.  As cases go Laying you out for thinking with your dick Is pretty low on my list of priorities.  Actually   i was looking for simple human connection.  No.  Right.  You're right.  We all have secrets we prefer not to share   angel.  Skeletons.  Feel free to keep yours in the closet.  Deep in the closet.  Thanks   maria.  There's something else you should hear from me Instead of the grapevine.  Angel   how  How dark of a time was this? It's regarding my recommendation of debra morgan for detective.  So   when you and mom get married What should we call you? Um   i think mr.  Handsome Would be a good name.  Is that you   ramon? Uh   you can call me whatever you want.  I think we'll just call you dexter.  That sounds good.  Following me With kids in my car? Now you're just pissing me off.  Moment of truth.  Stop or get a ticket   asshole.  Did you see that   dexter? Yeah   that's what happens when drivers do stupid things.  Looks like he's okay enough to walk away.  Until i get a hold of him.  This is gonna be a nice dinner.  Thank you for doing this   dexter.  Just doing what grooms are supposed to do.  So how are you coming along with your vows? Still working on 'em.  I'm going to lob this in nice and easy.  What kind of vows did you do the first time around? The first time? Well   paul and i just recited whatever the pastor said.  Liar   liar   pants on fire.  Maitre d' said we'd be seated in 15 minutes.  Un Fucking Believable.  Ramon   why don't we go outside and talk about this.  Fuck you.  You don't tell me what to do.  Look   these people have nothing to do with this.  This is between you and me   right? I should put a bullet in your head.  In front of everybody.  So they can see what it's like to lose someone.  Ramon.  Come on   you need to put the gun down Before anyone gets hurt.  Freeze   asshole.  Get your hands off me! I will   as soon as i get Some of your sheriff buddies down here! Thank you.  They all say the same thing.  \"King was a very polite gardener.  I can't believe he's the skinner. \" I hate polite killers.  I heard you took down ramon prado last night.  Again.  Yeah   the prados must love me.  Morgan.  You gonna eat that? Not anymore   thanks.  That was robbery.  There was a hit And Run fender bender Involving a stolen car.  Traffic enforcement caught the guy's face.  Guess who.  They're sending a photo over right now.  George fucking king.  God   that's definitely him.  Robbery's sending the car in right now.  I'll grab my kit.  We'll tear that car apart.  By the book   mr.  Morgan.  If you need us   we're right outside   lieutenant.  Thanks.  How's it feel   ramon? How the fuck does what feel? Wake up sober for the first time in a week.  Like shit.  Yeah   that shit's called reality.  It's gonna be life as you know it for a long time.  I'm gonna be outta here in a couple of days.  One last coupon from your famous brother's reputation.  Something like that.  So you don't really have to bother with reality.  That must be nice.  You know what my fucking reality is? Miguel takes me on as a bodyguard And i ask him why.  You know what he says? To protect him from you.  Did he say why? No.  The only one miguel needed protection from was himself.  The man was paranoid.  That's not true.  That's true.  You know it as well as i do.  Look   i spent a lot of time with your brother But it wasn't 24/7; i don't know what he was up to When i wasn't around.  Neither does syl   neither do you.  What i do know is this You got a really ugly history.  Kidnapping   brutality   abuse.  You trashed my apartment   you followed me.  You put a gun in my face in front of my friends In front of my pregnant fiancee.  Why   ramon? What's your endgame? To hurt you.  Until you came into our life   everything was fine.  Fine like what? Like oscar's drug problem? Like miguel'sdarkness? What do you know about that? We were close.  Miguel and i.  He told me things.  He told me how he pushed your father down the stairs To protect oscar and you.  And that he enjoyed it.  He fucking told you that? It was me that did that to our father.  Miguel took it from me; made it his story.  Part of his god damn legend.  Miguel always had to be the star.  He got the looks   the charm Maybe even the brains   but i got the strength.  I spent my whole life trying to hold it together And now it's all gone to shit.  It doesn't have to.  Bullshit.  Those cases you're talking about The kidnapping   the brutality That was me sweeping up after miguel's fuck Ups.  He wasn't making my problems go away I was risking my ass to cover his.  I know the frustration   the disappointment Of wanting to help your brother and not being able to.  Where's your son right now? Soccer practice.  Your daughter? Preschool.  Where do they think their father is? Sara told them something.  I  I don't know.  Someday your kids will be old enough To see the truth for themselves.  Just like you did with your father.  I know.  I've been there.  The sins of the father go on and on From kid to kid to kid.  Unless someone  You   Chooses to end them.  I've been there too.  You don't always have to destroy a wounded animal.  Sometimes you just remove the thorn.  Those dark lines Reticulated veins.  Oh   holy shit   it is skin.  No   more like More like leaf.  So the only evidence we got from the car that skinner stole is a frigging leaf? You gotta be fucking kidding me.  Yup.  Tobacco leaf.  Tobacco? Fuckin' A   wasn't there a   King's   uh   former employer What was the name? Thank you   vince.  You're welcome.  Cigar company.  What was it called? El royale cigar company.  It's listed on the first tax form Filled out by king in 1992.  Come on   let's go.  What do you think? It's great.  Thanks for doing this so fast   bruno.  Happy to help.  Now   you do that.  Okay.  And i'll get your shoes.  All right.  Remember what i taught you.  How could i forget? Mom's funeral.  The rabbit Hops over the log.  Your mother would be so proud.  Both of them.  The rabbit crawls under the log.  The rabbit runs around the log One more time Because he's trying to outsmart the fox.  The rabbit Dives through his rabbit hole.  Safe and sound.  Safe and sound.  Safe and sound.  What's this? All we got out of searching the cigar factory.  Total waste of time.  No sign of king? The security guard's there 'round the clock.  No way king gets in or out.  Tomorrow is my wedding day.  Some men would be excited.  Others panicky.  Me? I feelcalm.  What are you doing here on a saturday? I'm just   uh   reanalyzing some of the evidence From king's stolen car.  Francis   you came through.  Morgan.  Glad you're here.  I wanna talk to you.  Oh   shit.  I didn't know she was here.  Did i say anything bad about her? You're not the one she's gonna ream.  Sit.  That's okay.  It seems the a. D. A.  Has noticed That your personal and professional lives Are colliding.  All right.  Listen   anton wasn't officially a c. I.  When that happened.  So it was a one Time thing? No.  Still going on? I'm not sure.  Do you want it to? I don't know.  He could be a key witness in my case.  Doesn't have to be your case.  You know what.  You go ahead.  You take away my case   you take away my shield.  I don't care anymore.  Because it wasn't the wrong decision.  I wanted to be with anton.  I still want to be with anton.  And there is no possible way That us being together is a mistake.  Which means you're not Sacrificing your personal life to work.  Good for you.  Congratulations   detective morgan.  What? You're one of the smartest   hardest working Most annoying pain In The Ass cops In my department.  And you've earned this.  What about the a. D. A. 'S ethics probe? The a. D. A.  Is dead.  Try one of these.  Ganache frosting.  You hold onto that personal life.  Yeah.  Reminds us what's important.  Cupcakes.  Abso Fucking Lutely.  Such a familiar situation.  Such an unfamiliar perspective.  George king.  So ramon wasn't the only one following me.  I underestimated miguel after all.  This is the part where my fear is supposed to build.  I know his m. O.  By heart.  But you're not afraid.  No.  I'm not.  I am.  I've been scared of it coming to this your whole life.  A violent end.  I tried to protect you.  And you did.  This is my fault for not trusting you.  Instead i trusted miguel fucking prado.  You did the best you could.  I need you to understand something   dexter.  So did i.  The very best that i could.  I hope to be half as good a father to my son.  Your son.  Dad.  I forgive you.  I've never seen you cry before.  They're not my tears   dex.  They're yours.  I know   but i've never I've never felt this.  You've never had a son before.  You want to see him come into the world.  Yes.  To raise him with rita.  To watch him grow up.  To protect him.  I know.  I didn't.  Until now   when it's all gonna be taken away.  I wanna be there for him.  I've never wanted anything so much in my life.  Come in.  You're completely different from me.  You're laid Back And musician Y   andun Ambitious.  You're like valium.  And you're like red bull.  You are the best thing that has happened to me.  I'm still a witness in your case.  It's not my case.  I recused myself.  You gave up a case  This case? I had a choice.  I chose you.  Your turn.  I've already chosen.  Hold on.  Hold on   i'll turn it off.  Wait   just   uh   What? George king wasn't at that cigar factory.  Fucking duh   but that's not my case anymore.  Why? Well   i re Ran the tobacco That we got from george king's stolen car.  It turns out it's at least a dozen years old.  I called the cigar factory.  They only moved in there three years ago.  Where'd they move it? I know that look.  I've had that look.  He likes control.  Needs it.  So i'll take it away from him.  I killed freebo.  Sorry 'bout that.  I tied him up.  Not unlike this.  Stabbed him in the left carotid artery.  Used his 16 Inch   carbon steel Bone saw to separate his limbs.  I don't believe you.  Divided them equally Amongst six biodegradable trash bags.  Which are long gone now Carried north on the gulf stream.  You're lying.  Usually.  Not now.  No point.  Why would you have done such a thing? Oh   i have my excuses and justifications But   really   i just Need to.  Like you.  You have your excuses Finding freebo   getting your money.  But you know he's dead.  You know there's no money.  So really   you're just A killer.  A monster.  The stuff of nightmares.  I could kill you now.  If you can convince yourself i'm lying.  That you need to skin me to get information out of me.  You are lying.  You do know where he is.  Miguel prado tell you that? He wanted me dead.  So he used you.  He played on your obsession.  It probably wasn't too hard.  I mean   you're a little single Minded.  Let's hope you're this talk active Once i get my tools.  A wolf would chew off its own paw.  Its survival instinct is that fierce.  So is mine.  Fuck!

        "script": "~ Dexter S04E01 ~ ~ \"Living the Dream\" ~ ~ VO by weiserthomas and BlindesHuhn ~ Previously on Dexter That's for sure, I'm pregnant.  What kind of father would I be? After all, I kill people.  Me, demented daddy Dexter.  This child is happening.  But your role in its live is entirely up to you.  Yesterday morning you said, when the case ends, we end.  I thought you understood when we got involved.  I track killers, that's what I do.  A pattern of bodies was identified in Oregon.  My flight leaves tonight.  If you're leaving, we got to work out logistics.  Do you honestly want to go down this path? I don't know if I'm gonna be a father to the kid.  How could you even say you're not gonna be a father to that kid? I mean, where would you be without Harry? Harry knew my mother.  Laura Moser was his informant.  Was he just using her? Was he using me? Dad wasn't perfect, Deb.  What did he do? Did he cheat on mom? Bullshit! Who? I need all the records you have on my dads confidential informants.  Track the female CIs.  Why? You know something? There's a good reason why Quinn's of interest to Internal Affairs.  Internal Affairs was investigating you.  Is there something you're not telling us?   Anton's not officially CI.    What do you mean? I never filed an arrest report on him.  You are the best thing that has happened to me.  Just sending out my positive intentions to our baby.  Rita, we're connected.  You're what makes me real.    Please, say yes.    Yes, we will mary you.  Sylvia has offered to list my house, so we can buy something bigger.  Better hope she doesn't insist on a place with central air.  I was actually thinking I might keep my place.  \"No\" doesn't really work in a relationship, Dexter.  Every man needs his privacy.  Some more than others.  Is it possible I had actually made a friend? Someone I can trust with my dark secrets? I didn't teach you the code to share with your buddies.  Miguel really did it and I taught him how.  Harry was right.  He used me.  You're all just unshaved versions of myself.  What I would have become without my fathers code.  I could kill you now.  I've never felt this.  You've never had a son before.  You want to see him come into the world.  Yes.  I never wanted anything so much in my live.  I have moved on from my father.  But I still need his code.  Up right now, live is good.  Dexter Morgan, family man.  Tonight's the night.  The night when a primal sacred need calls to me.  I've waited and waited, but tonight, this night, it's time.  Tonight's the night I finally sleep.  Oh my God! No! Okay, Harrison.  The driving thing didn't work.  The singing thing didn't work.  You planning on both of us not sleeping for another three month? Apparently so.  Okay, I want to take you inside, but I don't want you waking mommy.  Hey! If you could talk you'd tell me not to worry about you, right? No! Please! Please! It's already over.  Marco? Polo! Marco? Polo! There's this clich\u00e9, where serial killers are always described as quiet, kept to themself, kind of a loner.  And it's a clich\u00e9 for a reason.  Has anybody seen my keys? Astor, I asked you to keep it down.  Why do you hate my music so much? No, I don't hate your music.  You don't? Cody, get the hell out of this pool! It's time for school! If I had an iPod you wouldn't have to listen to my stuff.  You want an iPod, earn one.    Do your chores, unplug your Metal.    Mom, you're so unfair! Did you get any sleep? An hour and a half maybe.  You've court.  Look, I appreciate that you're in the night shift.  But when you have a big day like today, it's okay to wake me up.  Well, it's kinda on the job training, you know.  All that matters is his father's there for him.    I cannot find the keys.    Cody! Astor, the music! You usually let them lie here by the phone.  I know.    School, clothes, now.    Sorry.  If you don't get some sleep, it won't be your keys that get lost.  Rather your mind.  I lost it eight years ago.  Dexter Morgan, good suburban husband, happy father of three On paper anyway.  Hey, Dex! What's the news? Too soon to tell.  Dexter! Dex, you forgot your cellphone.  Good morning, Elliot! That's a beautiful day.  More pool time for the kids.  You already took the morning shift, so I'll watch them this afternoon.  Takes a village.  Carpools and swimming pools How much are we living the dream? So much.  Living the dream Hey, um do you think you can tivo John Steward for me? You're thinking about John Steward? Well, he is handsome and funny.  I love you.  Motherfuck me.  Well, that's kinda where this is heading.  No, I'm late for work.  It's a good thing you moved down or I'd never see you.  Well, one of us has to live here.  At least with the crew ship I get to see you every few days.  I went on tour.  I know.  It's okay, I kinda like it.  Keeps you from getting sick of me.    That's never gonna happen.    Yeah, because you're never here.  No, because you make me happy.  And what conclusions did you draw from the blood evidence, Mr.  Morgan? I was able to determine the victims movement and direction after the initial blunt force trauma to the head caused by the defendants fist.  How so? I reconstructed err timeline and sequence of events by examining It's here somewhere.  I noticed a passive flow patterned blood stain, approximately 2 meters in length, emanating from the head wound and the sample was consistent with the sample from the defendant's shirt.  You did say \"passive flow patterned blood stain\".  Quote on quote.  What exactly do your notes say? The blood stain described a passive pooling and flow configuration type 0 negative, matching the sample taken from Leon Etti's shirt.  But this is the Gomez hearing.  Yes, Mr.  Morgan.  The defendant's name is Benito Gomez.  I must have brought the wrong notes.  Do you frequently become confused and disoriented while conducting your spatter analysis, Mr.  Morgan? No, I do not.  We just had a new baby.  Things were a little hectic this morning.  So you're saying that you're sleep deprived and that it's effecting your judgement? No, it's just a momentary mixup.  Wrong notes, wrong blood type, wrong defendant, wrong case, That's what you call a momentary mixup in a murder trial? I misspoke.    Fuck it!   Your honor, the witness has just demonstrated how unreliable he is in a court room.  I would have to ask how reliable his work is in the lab or on a crime scene.  Moreover, how reliable is a police department, that they would place so much trust in his expert opinion.  I'm halfway through the CI files you gave me.  If I were you, I'd spend more time with that man of yours and less time looking for some old CI your daddy might've diddled back in the day.  I meet another one tomorrow.  Maybe then I'll finally get some answers.  Say, you do, then what? Then I'll know, that my perfect fucking father wasn't so fucking perfect.  So that's what? The meaning of live? The meaning of my live.  Hey, buddy.  Guess where I was yesterday.    Well, I'm not sure   I visited a store.  Wanna take guess what kind of store?   I don't know.  Grocery?   Clothing.  You know me, I'm pretty into that shit.  Got to come correct, you know.  But not yesterday.    Look, if this is about   Come on, buddy.  Let me finish.  I was at a store helping a lady to pick out a suit for her son.  Know why? Cause he had to be in court, see the guy who killed his old man.  Kid's first fucking suit.  Something a father should be doing.    I'm sorry.    Little late for sorry.    That asshole you let walk   Benito Gomez.  Ah! Now you get it right.  Did you actually see what that fuckhead did? Gomez hit the kid's old man so hard his cheekbone broke, pushing his eyeball up and out of his face.  Then Gomez, sweetheat that he is, kills the guy in front of his own son.    I know.    How about this beauty? Gomez did five years for beating his girlfriend so bad even her dentist had a hard time with the ID.  So is your \"Sorry\" gonna keep Gomez from   pummeling somebody else into Dex's world?   Jesus, chill out, Quinn! No, Deb, he's right.  I screwed up in court today.  Gomez walked.  This one's on me.  Thanks.  That means so much.  Why don't you hold on to this for me, ok, buddy? I'm sick of looking at him.  You screwed up? Big time.  Should I be worried? No, I'll be okay.  Maybe it's Benny Gomez who should be worried.  And good solve on the Reynolds case, guys.  Next up, chief's office wants Anything I can do to keep that angry Irish off your ass, let me know.  You're a real friend, Vince.  Quinn is a good cop.  I need a good kill.  And sometimes one just falls into your lap.  We got a body in Kendall.  Morgan, Quinn, you're up.  And Dexter, there's blood.  Lots of blood.  Talk about your blood bath.  Tough room.  Okay, femoral artery severed.  She bled out in minutes.    Suicide?   No weapon on the premises.  Exactly.  The coroner can suck my uncircumsized dick if he doesn't rule this as a homicide.  It's way too much information, Masuka.  Employment ?records? show she just got promoted to sous chef.  A total babe and she could cook.  Had it all going on.  Then this.  It's a very well organized crime scene.  The assailant took his time, cleaned up after himself.  Obviously doesn't have kids.  Keep an eye on our expert witness.  In case our girl's parents actually want to see someone go to jail for doing this to their daughter.  Harsh.  Christine Hill, Florida Journal Dispatch.  And? And was Miss Bell the only victim? Who gave you her name? I searched the address on this thing called the internet.  What can you tell me about the murderer? Suspects? Murder? Suspects? We still haven't officially ruled out suicide.  So it's pills? No.  Then she bled out.  Women pretty much only do one or the other.  Do me a favor, if you break this case before we do, give me a call.  It's Detective Joseph Quinn.  Miami Metro, extension 3734.  Cell number? Nice touch, Joseph.  Damnit! Can anyone fill up the fucking water thing?   Tough crime scene?   No.  I know of nothing.  Yes.  You know, when things are going good, I think that's God's way of saying to cover your ass because something is gonna jump up and bite it.  Hard.  Well put.  You and Anton are doing okay? Like on what? Any sign your ass is gonna get bit? None.  So this is you just making yourself crazy? That's kind of what I do.  What? It's just that I've taken that trip a thousand times before.    And?   And knock it off.  Is that an order, boss? Just some free advice from someone who has been there before.  Hey, did you ever go out with that guy that Anton wanted you to meet? Musicians, not really my dream.  He owns a restaurant.  Three of them.  Cuban restaurants.  What the fuck is wrong with musicians? That came out wrong.  What makes you think a Cuban restaurant matters? That came out wrong too.  I'm not looking for anyone new anyway.  But when and if I'll let you know.  Thanks.  Finally, peace and quiet.  No crying baby.  No Marco.  No Polo.  Just me and blood.  And Mister Benito Gomez.  Hard to find a ?lock stock? boxer like you.  Trailer park.  Great, kids, neighbours.  More kids.  Sounds like my world.  But this, the only still open for business establishment in a lonely strip mall.  That's kinda calling to me.  This feels good.  Hey, you.  Hey, Dex.  You're alone? Yeah, why? Well, Harrison won't go down for his nap.  Surprise, surprise.  You think maybe you could sing to him? You bet.  Okay.  I will gonna put you on speaker.  Oh beautiful for spacious skies, for amber waves of grain, for purple mountain majesty, above the fruited plain! America! America! God He's finally calming.  Thank you, Dexter.  I love you.  Me too.  First up today finish the Lisa Bell blood work.  Tonight, a little Benny Gomez recon.  Then go home and sing the last 95 verses of \"America, the beautiful\" to my baby son.  Who knew live can get so unsimple? I can deal.  I can deal.  Yo, Quinn.  Boobs plus drinks equals Tell you, boy, I can't.  Got a date.  How about you, Morgan? Stud muffin still out of town? It's tempting, Masuka.  Anyhow again, fuck off and die,   and die again.    So that's a no? I'm feeling no love here, folks.  Then it's working.  Hey, slacker! Half day? This is me leaving, Vince.  I do it everyday.  But everyday wasn't like today.  What you went through? Come on! Drinks are all on me.  And it'll cheer you up! I'm not uncheered.  Yeah? Tell that to your face! I'm going home to my family.  Vastly overrated.  Just got a call from robbery.  Some guy in his honeymoon took a shot in the head.  Grave condition, they're pulling the plug tomorrow.  Nice fucking wedding gift.  Yeah, the file is gonna land on my desk first thing in the morning.  And robbery has got squad.  It's gonna be a total goat fuck.  It sounds like you need a drink, papi.  You know what, Vince? I can use a Cuevo or ten.  My dark passenger is like a trapped coal miner, always tapping, always letting me know it's still in there, still alive.  Quinn's legwork may have shown me where to find our friend, but this, Benny My bloodwork is the stuff that seals your fate.  No security cameras, parks away from the lights, You just come and go as you please.  But as of tomorrow night, those days are over.  I wasn't sure you actually come by.  I did my face time with Masuka and then I came to where I really wanted to be.  Tell me again this isn't crazy.  Yeah, it's crazy.  Crazy good.  Keep shooting.  He's so sweet, when he is sleeping.  Pure and innocent.  Well, then we grow up, things happen.  Nothing's gonna happen.  Not when he has a great dad watching over him.  Yeah, he's a lucky guy.  Astor!   Mom!   Turn that down! We wouldn't have this problem,   if you would just give me an i   This is not how you go about getting an iPod.  Now since you woke your brother up, you can walk him around in the living room until he falls asleep.    But he never sleeps!   Think about that next time.  Here you go.  You'd like an iPod, wouldn't you, little Harrison? Why not just end the terror and give her an iPod? No, it's a power play.  She is trying to manipulate us to get what she wants.  That's not how it works in this family.  Oh, right.  Of course.  Cody? No more Marco Polo in the mornings.    But it's important!   So is being ready for school.  When I grow up I wanna be just like you.  Do what I want, when I want.  You and me both.  I wanna be just like you.    Marco?   Polo! Great time last night, huh, Angel? What? ?Give it to? you'd fuck that stripper.  Get to work, gentlemen.  What's got into her? What is this? \"Extreme Home Makeover, Forensics Edition\"? When I first passed through, I found some blood that didn't belong to the victim.  Possible DNA from the Killer? Don't think so, the sample was pretty degraded.  And what's the source? Not sure yet.  Coming from you, why does that not surprise me? You know he's my brother, right? Found something.  Mr.  Morgan.  It's blood.  Whole pattern.  Not an incidental spatter from the recent murder.  This is something else entirely.  Where is it from? Bathtub.  So, you're taking an already extremely difficult case ?including? it with your what, 'theories'? I didn't put the blood there.  And according to you neither did our killer.  Joey, why don't we step outside, that the geeks get their geek on? Okay, I gotta be somewhere, so see if you can work things down around here without going all asshole on my brother, okay? Blood tells.  Blood always tells.  Dexter.  How is my favorite blood spatter analyst? Uh, great.  How is my favorite serial killer hunter? You just missed Deb.  Actually I'm here to see you.    Oh.    Database has a girl killed here recently.  Severed femoral artery? Pretty brutal.  Crime scene telling you anything? Not much.  Killer was careful, right? Immaculate.  Very.  Well, you're in the middle of something here, I I don't want to interrupt.  Mind if I drop by the station later? Sure, not a problem.  Good seeing you again, Dexter.  Shit! Hello detective.  Why don't you come in? I'm here to talk about Harry Morgan.  I'm his daughter, Debra.  Debra Morgan.  Handsome Harry Morgan.  How is he? He died a while back.  Life does tend to suck.  Did you and my father have a good relationship? No.  Your father was a driven man.  He saw something he wanted, nothing got in his way.  Are you talking about women? Women, bad guys, anything, anyone.  Harry always said, the only word, that wasn't in his vocabulary, was 'No'.  Did you say no to him? Dear.  I said yes.  All the time.  Shit.  Hundreds of times.  Only problem was Only problem was what? I was saying yes to a question he never asked.  So you didn't have an affair with my father? I don't know who you're looking for, honey, but it ain't me.  Shut down for decades, way out of town.  I'm liking this.  Broken down box room, broken down arena.  A fitting place for a punk like Benny Gomez to go down for the con.  Where've you been?   Looking for misery.    No upside to that.  So I'm fucking learning.  That's all we got on the groom.  Plug was pulled 4:45 this morning.  It's all your's.  A man's life and death reduced to a few   What do you call them?   Bytes.  A few bytes.  Just like that.  With this economy, last thing our city needs is dead tourists.  Hey, \"Welcome to Miami.  Have a nice day. \"   Is that our tourist, sergeant?   It is, lieutenant.  Okay, the mayor has already given me an aneurism over this one, so   make it a quick solve.    Okay.  So, whatever happened between you and that Barbara Gianni from vice? We broke up.  Wanted different things.  Office romances doom before they fucking start.  Do you mind if I ask her out? Knock yourself out.  The perfect husband would have gotten rid of his old appartment, but I kill people.  Not exactly the perfect husband.  Someone new is moving in.  Be nice.  The land, the time and \"Florida Electric\" forgot.  Look at this place! All the cheering, all the triumph, all the blood, all for sport, until tonight.  Keep at it, Benny, and you'll be feeling no pain.  Better that way.  Tell me you got a reason for sleeping alone in your car outside a bar other than you're drunk.  I'm tired.  License and registration please? Sorry about this, officer, it's not what it looks like.  You're with homicide? Yes, sir.  Then you ought to know better.  Get out of the car, please.    You know your ABC?   Of course I do.  Give me 'em backwards.  Z, Y, X, W V, U, T, S, R, Q P, O, N, M, L, K   Shut up already.  You're not drunk yet.  Damn it, Benny! I can't go chasing after you with a cop up my ass.  You got more important places to be, Mr.  Morgan.  Tell me about it.  Hey.  Thought you were working late.  So did I.  Baby is down.  You know what that means? Sleep.    Sex!   Oh.  And I'm not talking the ?diminished?, frantic, the kids are asleep sex.  but slow, hot, steamy, naughty sex.  No, look, I'm feeling too tired.  Dexter, ever since the move and the baby   we have slept zero time together.    Yeah.  Well, aren't you as horny as I am? Of course I am.  Very well, just close your eyes.  Maybe I can squeeze in a power nap.  Okay, open.  Or not.  I was saving this for when we finally got some real time alone, and, and, tonight is the night.  It's alright, I'll go.  You've already done so much.  Look at that.  Yeah, who's a good boy? Who's a good boy? Yeah.  Wanna know a secret? Daddy kills people.  Well, bad people.  Not really anybody else I can tell about that, you know? Daddy's not going anywhere, buddy.  I already lost my innocence, I'm not gonna sacrifice yours, too.  \"Triple Red Eye\", please.  It's your third one today, bro, I feel if you're not backing, You're tempting the heart gods.  Least of my worries, bro.  Brought you a copy of my article.  Think you'd do a dumb cop not knowing the paper.  Thank you, some I've read.  I never miss the obituaries.  Front page.  Nice.  Yeah, I do what I can.  My editor okayed to follow up, you got anything for me? Would, if I could, but I got nothing.  Besides, off the record, we got bigger fish to fry.  What kind of fish? Off the record.  You know those pricks who've been shaken down tourists? The vacation robbers? No, the vacation murderers.  They shot some poor newly wed.  Didn't make it, so we're more than a little distracted.  You want another distraction? I'd love to take you out for a drink.  You know, to thank you for your help with the bathtub story   I'm so not hitting on you.    Yeah, me neither.  Let's make it dinner.  I've got the bloodwork back from the bathroom do over.  Did you run it through the database? No point.  The bloody swab shows shit all on the DNA front.  Our chances of finding out who it belongs to are about uh one in six fucking billion? What was Lisa Bell's adress? Well, the DNA won't tell us who it belonged to, maybe the adress.  Vicky Noonan, 22, found in the bath tub, bled out.  An incision to her thigh.  What are the chances of that? What are the chances of what? Special agent Lundy.  Vincent Masuka, if memory serves.  That's right.  LFI on the PHB.  You're working a case, right?   Feds need us to   Mind if I speak with Dexter? Uh, well, I go to records and get the write up on Noonan.  Just doing my job.  He's right.  About? Why I'm in Miami.  It is a case.  Yeah, i figured.  So why do you need me of the full resources of the FBI? Not anymore.  I'm retired.  Their loss.  Yeah, well.  I fish, travel and now I have the time to track down the one twisted son of a bitch who got away.  So, who is the twisted son of a bitch? I call him the trinity killer.  Kills in threes.  Been doing it all over the country for years.  Problem is, I can't prove he exists.  Law enforcement doesn't talk to each other.  So no one at the FBI is even on board.  Just me, and I'm looking for a break.    Then this happens.    Lisa Bell.  Her murder profile fits the previous victims.  Trinity is in Miami, Dexter, starting his cycle all over again.  No! No! No! How far back do your cases go? About fifteen years.  The house and room, where Lisa Bell was murdered, was the site of a very similar homicide thirty years ago.  Take a look.  No! No! Always come full circled.  He's back where his ?coming? began.  Thirty years.  You know, what this means? Trinity is the most successful serial killer, who would ever get away with it.  What? I'm fine.  Can't wait to see you.  Anton, I have to go, I have a meeting.  Hello, Debra.  Motherfucking fuck.  Nice to see you too.  Fuck.  What are you doing here? Are you here on a case? Actually I'm retired now.  Yet you're here.  Life has a natural forward momentum.  Certain things are inevitable.  Like you, making detective.    Congratulations.    Thanks.  I never had any doubt.  So, how long will your foward momentum keep you in Miami? Not sure exactly.  Be seeing you.  Yeah.  I guess, I maybe I mean, I don't know.  Big plans this evening, sergeant? The usual, lieutenant.  Hey, guys.  Drinks? I had Benny Gomez on the ropes and let him slip away.  No way I can go to that bar again.  Officer Alphabet made sure of that.  Which means I grab Benny, where he lives.  A higher degree of difficulty, but I don't have a choice.  If I wanna be around for my son, I have to do this right.  I'm killing for two now.  What do you want? You.  Look at him.  Fast asleep.  Lucky guy.  I know you.  I'm the blood guy.  You've made a lot of people very miserable.  Me included.  So now Because now I get to answer live's big question.  My live anyway.  Can I do it? Can I have it all? Ah, shit! Hello? Dexter, I need you to go to an all night pharmacy right away.  I'm kinda in the middle of something.  Harrison has an ear infection.  He's in a lot of pain, Dexter.  Whatever you're doing can wait.  Oh, right, my mistake.  I wasn't thinking.  I'm on my way.  Kids Got to go.  No time to savor this.  The clock's ticking.  Well, this is all about sacrifice, the good of the family.  Maybe the night wasn't perfect.  Maybe I need to reboot the way I do things.  But at least I'm on the right road.  I'm on my way to taking care of my family, raising my son, and all the while doing what I have to do to satisfy a calling that I can't ignore or deny.  I can do this.  Dexter! You don't need to sleep! You need to wake up!       Previous EpisodeNext Episode"

I haven't seen you, spoken to you, Or exchanged so much as a fucking christmas card With you in two years.  Now all of a sudden you're in miami Holding a pair of chopsticks without so much As an email saying, \"hey, remember me? \"we used to fuck.  i'm coming to town.  You want to grab lunch?\" I mean, seriously.  what the fuck? I know.  same old mouth.    not without its charm.    really? That's all you have to say to me?   i should have let you know i was coming to miami.  This task force they're trying to put together Is hush hush.  Plus i knew you'd be busy, What with making detective and all.    yeah, well, tell me about it.  I have a suspect en route.    the lisa bell case?   what do you know about lisa bell?   only what your brother's told me.    well, \"check this,\" she brags.  We found another murder.  Same m. o. , same address, Same fucking bathtub.  A guy was convicted.  He's back out in the world.  So how do i not like him for slicing up lisa bell?   sounds like he deserves a good hard look.    i had patrol pick him up.  Should be here any minute.    mind if i tag along?   to the interview?   i'd like to see detective morgan in all her glory.    sounds like someone's bored with retirement already.    here you go.  thanks very much.  Keep the change.  Come on, guys.  Come on, boys.    oh, sorry, sir.  It was an accident.    it's okay, kiddo.  It happens.  What is that, strawberry?   uh, bubble gum gelato.    how, uh repulsive.  [chuckles] You better catch up with your mom.  You don't want to lose her.    just had to find blood, didn't you?   it is my job.    and you've got a family to support And people to dismember.  You're spinning too many plates, dexter.    the sooner i wrap this up, The sooner i get to the boxing arena.    you might want to give some thought As to what happens when somebody else Finds that body.    [sighs and clears throat]   manager's on his way to open the safe.    what's the date of birth on his passport?   5/5/72.  [keypad tones]   [sighs] geez.    don't sweat it, quinn.  I've got much bigger things to worry about.    i filled in the lieutenant on what we found.    \"we\"?   dude, there's no \"me\" in \"team. \" Well, technically there is, but     blood deposit on the yucca On the assailant's escape route.  He probably scraped himself.    does that mean we have his dna?   i'll run it through the database Soon as i get back to the lab.    go.  You, come with me.    i'm going Just not where you think.    you were convicted of killing your wife back in '79.  Sliced open her femoral artery.  She bled to death in your bathtub.    do i need to talk to a lawyer?   at this point, we're interviewing you To get more or less an expert opinion.    see, your case bears an uncanny resemblance To a case we're working on now.  Same m. o.  a la that femoral artery.  Same house.    same everything.    no fucking way.    yes fucking way.  Sort of puts you at number one, person of interest wise.    i didn't kill my wife.    oh, no? You're just another innocent man behind bars For no good reason.    the fucking deck was stacked Before i walked into that courtroom In a death penalty state.    you copped to doing the deed.  You took the deal.    i did my time and i moved on.    you moved on to lisa bell.    who is lisa bell?   the young lady that you killed last monday night In your old house.  Whatever sick fucking poetry you find in that.  Tell us what you did, mr.  noonan.    it was muggy for so late at night.  And vicky, my wife Wanted to cool off in the tub, so I went out to score some shit and i came back.  And i found her.  [weeping]   i wish i could buy the tears.  I just I can't get there.    monday night i was working a swing shift At the homeless shelter in allapatah Hosing piss off the sidewalk From the folks waiting to get inside Until 8:00 fucking a. m.    we'll call the homeless shelter.  Verify your story.    one, the guy's a train wreck.  Two, he's a total slob, he smells like a sewer, And his fingernails are disgusting.    our killer's meticulous.  Zero dna left at the crime scene.    obviously you caught his case of the shakes.    given his rehab history, i'm voting dts.    and lisa bell was cut with surgical precision.    so, detective morgan Are we in agreement here?   violent agreement Retired special agent lundy.    if noonan didn't kill lisa bell, Why is the m. o.  the same as his wife's murder?   copycat?   of an obscure   do we think noonan's telling the truth That he didn't kill his wife?   i believe we do.    shit.    i have a theory i'd like to run by you.  We could grab dinner, review the case, Maybe catch a bad guy.    iuh Okay, i guess.  Um, i've got to cut noonan loose And make sure he talks to a lawyer.  If our side railroaded him into that plea bargain, He could have one fuck mother of a case.    you have a good heart, debra.  Pick you up around 8:00?   yeah, so i'll   Yes.  yes.    the boxing arena's at the next off ramp, But i still have miles to go before i sleep.  Bits and pieces.  Memory fragments.  All i have from last night.  Looks like i got the job done.  Almost.  Blood.  I was off my game.  Sloppy.  With harry's code ingrained in me, Cleaning a kill room should be automatic.  The code.  Etched into my memory to ensure survival.  What would i do if i couldn't properly dispose of a body? I'd hide it.  I investigate crime scenes all the time.  But this one My crime scene It's giving me nothing.  Damn it.  Focus.  Track it.  Where did i go from here? The pharmacy.  Harrison's ear ache medicine.  The only stop i made before the crash.  The only stop i remember.    if you thought you were coming right back, Not a bad hiding place.    why are you wearing those?   this is the way i was dressed the first time we met.  Your mother's murder was the last time Your memory was a blank.  Why do you suppose that is?   not in front of my baby! no! [screaming]   because not remembering saved me.    and now if you want to save yourself, You have to remember.  If you don't fix this screw up, Harrison's only memory of his father Will be of you behind bars.    it's not a screw up.  I just can't remember.  Got to check today's incident reports.  Make sure benny's body hasn't surfaced.  It's in this city somewhere.    thanks for meeting me here.  The sooner we get an estimate and file a claim, The sooner my husband gets his car back.    well, that much damage, i wouldn't even try To talk you into fixing it.    i thought it was a fender bender.    well, i'm sure there's a bent fender Somewhere in this mess.    oh, my god.    everybody got off easy on this one.  Your husband, my company.  He should count his blessings.    yes, he should.    hey, buddy.  you lose something?   there's an understatement.  Can't find my i. d.    use mine to buzz you in.    all right.  Thanks.    look, the other day after court, I was totally out of line going off on you like that.  Gomez is the criminal, not you.    no, not me.    plan on having a heart to heart With the prick when i find him.    benny?   yeah, want him to know he's still on my radar, But he's been laying low.  [door buzzes]   look, can we do this another time? My password.    access denied, dex.    i can't even remember my own password.    i'm here to help.  Think.    h a r r y.  Thanks, dad.  Bank hold up.  Alligator in backyard.  Kidnapped three year old found safe.  But no body parts turning up.  [sighs] From boxing arena, to pharmacy, to the crash.  What am i missing?   girl scout cookie time again?   no, i froze them in case of emergency.    what's the emergency?   frank lundy.  I haven't heard from him in, like, forever, And then he shows up out of the blue For some hush hush task force and wants to know All about my case.  Not to drag you into my shit.    drag away.  In this boys' club, who else you gonna talk to?   this is about him trying to get next to me.    maybe, but you do have a boyfriend.    hell yeah, i do.  A good one.  And i'm really fucking happy.    can i make a suggestion Before you eat the box too? If there is still something, anything, Between you and lundy     there's so not.    closure will set you free.  Does my hair look better up or down?   down definitely.    thanks.    okay, benny, i got to find you Before anyone else does.  Better fucking start all over again.

Cut the shit, frank.  you're retired.    the reason i'm in miami Is because i'm convinced that these bathtub murders   Noonan's wife, lisa bell   are connected To a series of murders all over the country.    oh.    it's become something of an obsession of mine and I'm not about to ride off into the sunset And dump something this horrific On whoever gets my office next.    christ.  I   [chuckles] i've got to go.  I'm an idiot.    debra.    rita, what are you doing here?   you lied to me, dexter.  I saw your car.  it wasn't a fender bender.  It was destroyed.    i didn't want you to worry.    yeah, well, you're not doing a good job.  I'm worried sick about you.    i'm fine.  All right, a little headache and a stiff neck.    get your stuff.  i'm gonna take you home.    i can't.  The lieutenant is holding over the shift Because of these murders that are in all the papers.    you fell asleep at the wheel.  Almost got killed because of the hours That they keep you here night after night after night.    so much for my standard alibi.  This is a job i signed on for.    i'm sorry.  I didn't sign on to be a widow.  You know what? i'll just talk to maria myself.    rita, no.  don't do this.  Not here.  this is my job.

[keypad tones]   no.  no, i don't   I don't want to talk to your doctor.    i want you to.    i mean, i guess he wouldn't have released you If it was anything serious.    i'm sure they'd all rather be home with their families, Just like me.    i know.    come on, i'll walk you out.  [elevator bell dings] [sighs]   you gonna pick that up?   no, i am not, vince.  You got a problem with that?   dude, seriously, You're freaking me out.    i have someplace i need to be.    i also have places i need to be.  Not good places, butplaces.    come on, blood.  Talk to me.  If somebody tested positive for an std, Would they have to register with the miami health authorities?   and why would you ask me that?   yes or no, vince? Lieutenant.  Found your guy.  Name's johnny rose.    you found a suspect?   all his info's in there.    how?   i reworked the blood sample looking for other markers And found a street 14 strain of drug resistant syphilis.  I checked that against the std registry For anyone being treated with heavy duty meds Over the last week.  Turned up a few prostitutes and one johnny rose.  Good science says he's your guy.    okay, briefing room in five minutes.  Strategy meeting.  Dexter's turned up a lead on our shooter.    hey, dex, hold up.    i need to be somewhere.    good work back there.  This rose guy gets syphilis and fingered for murder?

I have a life.  you have a life.  Just leave it alone.  all right? [engine turns] Benny gomez.  The last place i'm gonna look Is the last place i saw you.    moment of your time, lieutenant? escuchame, maria.    angel People will think something's up.    something is.    angel, if this is about the mayor, I had no choice.    i'm not angry about you taking me off the case.  It's how you did it.    angel, por favor.  I don't even know how to act around you anymore.    this isn't easy for me either.  Maybe we need a Break.    yeah, you're right.  It's probably for the best.  So that's that.    so that's that.    so?   so.  Why are we thinking ourselves out of a good thing?   what do you think's going on in there?   who cares.

Now it makes sense.  Harry was reminding me the whole time.  I was reminding myself the whole time.  Hello, benny.  Good bye, benny.  Got to admit pretty clever.  Hiding benny gomez like that Until i could come back and get him.    you turned to the code.  A core memory.  I taught you well.  Finding gomez was a band aid.

I'd like to keep you here for observation.  dexter, oh my god! You all right?   i'm fine.  Just a little fender bender.  Doc says i'm good to go.  you got a minute? I'd, uh, like to pick your brain.  Lisa bell? the girl in the bathtub.  of course.  The trinity killer's most recent victim.    trinity is going to kill again.  Another woman, older than lisa bell this time.    but the person that you should really be talking to Is my sister  she's lead on lisa bell.    you sure that's a good call? given our history.    i wouldn't want to mislead you.  What i have with anton.  it's it's great.  I fucking love you.    the reason i'm in miami is because i'm convinced These bathtub murders are connected to a series or murders All over the country.    christ.  i'm an idiot.  debra!   tell me again this isn't crazy.  crazy good.    i brought you a copy of my article.    a string of robberies turned deadly in what authorities Are now calling the vacation murder.    i found your guy.  name's johnny rose.    briefing room in five minutes.  strategy meeting.  Dexter's turned up a lead on our shooter.  don't sweat it, quinn.  I've got much bigger things to worry about.    i thought it was a fender bender.    i'm sure there's a bent fender somewhere in this mess.  oh, my god.    rita, what are you doing here? you lied to me, dexter.  the backyard barbecue.  It's a holdover from the last ice age when food was scarce And men had to work together to take down such a large beast.  Those who worked well with others survived, And their genes have been passed down through the centuries Until they landed here  In this My community.  Soda? whatever.  how 'bout you? i'm good.  ah, wasted youth.    hey, can i talk to you for a second? yeah.    i just got off the phone with dr.  montgomery, The doctor that took care of you after your accident.  oh, right.    why didn't you tell me you had a concussion?   i just wanted to keep you from worrying.  You already have so much to deal with.    the doctor also told you that you weren't supposed to drive For the next ten days, and you didn't listen.  So i will now be doing all your driving.  I will take you to work in the morning, And i will pick you up at the end of the day.    rita, i'm perfectly capable    dexter.  The past few weeks, you have not been The most present father and husband.  Remember.  we're a team here, right? Okay, we work together.  she's right.  Maybe now's the time to turn that around.  Score a few points.  Which will then make rita more likely to say yes When i need a little time for myself.  You're right.  i'm sorry.    thank you.  let's go eat.    so i guess you saw somebody bashed in kate's birdbath.  i know, that's awful.  poor birds.  And poor kate.    why would someone do such a thing?   the same reason he knocked over The andersons' water fountain, Pulled down the garcias' basketball hoop And spray painted the schwarzs' trash cans.  'cause he's a dick.    he knocked the sea horse off my mailbox, too.  i hated that sea horse.    well, your mom picked it out.    you know andy.    uh, yeah, of course.    hi, how are you doing? hey, jess, jess, jess? Do you really need to be doing that? yeah, i really do.    his wife passed away last year.    so, uh, so about this neighborhood vandal.    we all need to work together to deal with this guy.    the last thing we need is a dangerous presence In our neighborhood.    you know, it's a funny thing, dexter.  This all started to happen time you moved in.  A little suspicious, don't you think? I'm just busting your chops.  oh.  My chops are busted.  The danger of community is that the people who don't belong Are looked upon with suspicion.  Those of us who prefer to work by ourselves, The lone wolves, risk being singled out.  cody.  what's that? waah! I'm gonna get you! oh, i'm scared!   so i become an expert at blending in, Camouflaging myself, becoming one of the guys.  astor, what's that? ahh! Oh, my god.  dexter! i'm so humiliated.  what were you thinking?   she was wearing a bathing suit.    this blending in thing isn't as easy as it looks.  we're here.  Stop right here.  That's okay.  oh! Oh, god, please.  don't hurt me! Oh, god! oh, god! don't do anything stupid.  Careful, now.  Wouldn't want to hurt yourself.  It's pretty, isn't it? Okay, now.  it's time for you to jump.  what? God, no.    yes.  it always ends like this.  no, but  shh.  It's already over.    why are you doing this to me?   you know i'm not to blame here.  come on, now.  please, no!   now you just need to let go And fall.  please, i'll do anything.    good.  jump.    no, i can't!   you can.    i have children!   i know.  jason and susie.    if you like, i can swing by your house, Put an ice pick in your husband's head, And bring your kids back, and throw them off one at a time Until you finally decide to jump.  Is that what you want? please what? please.  Just push me.  it doesn't work that way.  Jump.  oh mommy.    you've only been here a month, And they've already got you tagged.    it's not just me.  there are other houses.    dex, we've been through this before.  Bunch of kids tp'ed the house.    and you made me clean it up.    because it raised questions, dexter.  It would have made people think, \"why this kid? why him?\" You can't afford to have people asking those questions.  no one's asking questions.    getting married, having a kid, Moving here  I know you're under a lot of pressure.  yeah, i am.    but you can't let things slip.    i'm not slipping.  but somebody is.    how come you never make the coffee even if you're up first?   'cause i don't want it bad enough to make it.    i don't even know what to say to that.    well, baby, if there was chocolate cake here I would eat it, but i sure as hell don't want to bake one.  Hey! good news!   yeah?   yeah, the sandpiper hotel wants to book my band For a one month gig.  Three nights a week.  wow, that's great.  no more cruise ships.

Waiting for you to make me coffee.    ? karma karma karma karma karma chameleon ? ? you come and go ?   okay, if i count yesterday, then this is day two of me being The best husband in the world.  I can last another five days.  I really need to stop for a coffee someplace.  you already had a coffee.  ? red, gold and green ? ? every day is like survival ? ? survival ?   really, i started saturday afternoon, So it's actually been more like 2 1/2 days.    ? every day is like survival ? only 4 1/2 to go.  I'm never gonna make it.    as far as our vacation murder suspect, johnny rose, We've still come up with nothing.  We've spoken to his mother, his sister, His past two employers    everyone in his apartment building, his mailman, The liquor store guy across the street.  so no one's talking.    we have his immediate family members under surveillance, But we're still not getting any hits.  well, expand the search.  Draw up a new list of subjects.  Morgan, where do we stand on the lisa bell murder?   uh, somewhere in the middle of shit creek.    well, you better find a paddle, or i'm moving you Onto the vacation murder with the rest of us.  Finding johnny rose is our number one priority.  yes, ma'am.  dexter.  hey.  uh, hi.    quick question: do you like the dolphins?   i'm really more of a manatee guy, but sure.  club level seats.  Enjoy.    why? i can't go.  And i asked myself, Who's a friend that i could give 'em to? So i thought of you.    miami dolphins.  football.  club level? Jeez, who do i gotta fuck to get those kind of tickets? here.  No fucking.  dude.  all right, listen up.  We got a report of a female body found at the old port.  It looks like a jumper.  who wants it? sounds exciting, sarge, But i think i'm gonna hold out for a cat stuck in a tree.    huh, i wonder if that's the woman lundy predicted.    we'll take it.    okay.    unless she landed on a pile of marshmallows, There's gonna be blood.  Grab your kit.    sure, i'll follow you there.    ha ha, not a chance, concussion boy.  Rita said no driving for you.  you're coming with us.  climb in the back, dexter.  You'll be right on the subwoofer.  You can feel the bass in your spine.  loud.    female.  caucasian.  mid 30s, i'm guessing.    if this is the latest victim of lundy's trinity killer, Then he's a very different monster than i am.  cause of death? gravity.    why her? why here? What is trinity's code? Does he have one?   no sign of a struggle.  no pre mortem bruising.  No ligature marks.    it's looking like a suicide to me.  Oh, well, if it isn't special agent grandpa.    shut up, quinn.    detectives.  Morgan.    agent lundy.  masuka.  cool hat.  you have a name yet?   driver's license in her car says tarla grant From fort lauderdale.    so what brings you to our little suicide? just observing.    you're a little quick to decide it's a suicide, Aren't you?   still has her jewelry, money in her wallet.  Wasn't robbed.    well, why would she drive down from fort lauderdale To jump off this abandoned warehouse? maybe she liked seagulls.    well, until we know one way or the other I'd like to treat this as a homicide If that's okay with you.  all right.  You two, on the sixth floor.  The rest of you, search the grounds.    victim: tarla grant.    so listen i want to apologize For being such a douche the other night.  no need.  We're all allowed to be the occasional douche.  thanks.  It was pretty embarrassing.    debra, if we're being completely honest here, Then, yes, i did come to miami to follow a case.  But i have to admit That i'm glad the killer chose this city, Knowing i'd find you here.    so is dexter right? did you predict this jumper?   what i did was suggest that if trinity held to his pattern, We could expect to see another woman die soon.  is this her? little early to tell.  But you might want to check your missing persons reports.  I wouldn't be surprised to discover that she's married With two kids.  what else?   i'm very curious to know if there was a similar death At this site 30 years ago.  i make my bodies disappear.  Trinity leaves his out in the open, Supremely confident that no one will ever trace them to him, Decade after decade After decade.  Thanks for the ride.  anytime, partner.    great, security lights.  Just what every serial killer needs.  What are you looking at?   oh.    dexter!   did you get my message about the neighborhood watch meeting? actually, no, i didn't.  All: hey!   this is my community.  i am one of you.  Uh, great.  love having the neighbors over.    are you ready to fight crime, dexter? you betcha.    that's good.  be aware of your neighbors.  Know their schedules.  That way you'll know if something's different, If anything seems off.  we don't want that.    here, have a whistle and a head flashlight.  It'll keep your hands free when you're out patrolling.    patrolling? we're patrolling?   your job is to watch and report, watch and report.    watch and report.    you got it.    community college for me now.    hey, dexter, our neighborhood beautification association Asked me to give this to you.  i'm the secretary.  It's a warning against the graffiti on your gate.  I know it's silly, but they want you to repaint.  hey, dex.  I guess you saw the new motion detector lights I just put in.  sure are bright.    yeah, brightest i could get.  Made sure i angled one right on your place, too.    that's very neighborly of you.    we have to look out for each other.    yeah, this guy started off small, a few broken windows, Andy's mailbox, but yesterday he broke into The walkers' guest house and trashed the place.  Yeah, next thing he'll be stealing our women.  Can't let him steal our women, now, can we? no, they're our women.    is that the sign up sheet?   yeah, yeah.  See, we're setting up patrols for every night of the week.    i'm good for every night but wednesday.  I got a poker night at the lodge.  great.    no one will come in or out of this neighborhood unnoticed.  including me.  It's not the neighborhood vandal i'm worried about.  It's the neighborhood watch.  Hmm, graffiti.  Excuse me.    so i was all set to go to the university of miami next year Till my dad decided to get himself laid off.  that blows.  how about you, jesse? You want to sign up for the neighborhood watch? sounds kind of lame.  so lame.    paint can, soda can  i'm thinking fingerprints.  Let me get that for you.  And i know one little lady who is up past her bedtime.  mom!   dexter, you can't treat her like a little girl anymore.  i can't? hey, dex.  hey, elliot.  have a nice day!   you knew this day would come, dexter.  You've always been good with kids, But eventually they grow up.  They become more mature, Develop complex emotions that just aren't in your skill set.  Astor's becoming a whole person, and you're something less.    i hope you're not taking any of this seriously.  The wife, the kids, the house in the 'burbs.  It's all great camouflage, but that's all it is.    it's gotten more complicated than that.  then uncomplicate it.  You need to realize your limitations.  Remember exactly who you are.  Probably should have used something a little darker.    it's fine, dad.  nothing's gonna show through.    i hope not, dex.  for your sake.  hey, you ready to go? almost.    i've got the best of bananarama.  it's a cruel summer.  As long as the neighborhood vandal Keeps my neighbors on edge, i will have no privacy.  And i'm not going to let you do that to me, jesse.    tarla grant, married, mother of two.  it fits.    it fits what?   lundy's theory.    that she's another victim of the serial killer.  yes.  What?   his whole life is about serial killers.  That's all he thinks about, so of course he thinks She was killed by a serial killer.    i think he's a little smarter than that.    i'm sure you do, otherwise you wouldn't be Sitting at your desk going through 30 year old files All afternoon.  oh, yeah, guess what.  So are you.    just unsealed the juvey records of johnny rose, Our vacation murder suspect.  anything?   shoplifting with his high school girlfriend, nikki wald.    that was like, what, ten years ago? You think they're still in touch?   since she testified against him back then, I'd say extremely unlikely.    well, at this point, i think we need to take any shot we can.    she lives in oakland park.  i'll drive out there with you.  let's go.    that seem accidental and unplanned to you? even i believed it.    i was thinking we could stop somewhere for lunch first.    i know a little place where we can order some room service.    okay, here we go.  Female, caucasian, 36, mother of two.  Jumped to her death off the same warehouse.  The woman's family insisted she was the victim of foul play, But it was ruled a suicide.  doesn't mean fuck all.  Someone fell or jumped off The same warehouse eight years ago.  Someone else jumped off a ship loading crane On the same pier back in '86, And another body washed up on the rocks Right in front of the warehouse only two years ago.  Nobody knows how it got there.  This is miami, deb.  people die.    and sometimes it's by murder.  i want to follow up on this.    okay, tarla grant seemed to have a pretty decent life.  No apparent reason for suicide, so keep it open for now.    fuckin' a we'll keep it open.    i'd know that foul mouth anywhere.    anton, what are you doing here? i love you too, baby.  Come on, let's have some lunch.    i have a fuckload of work to do.  All right.  All right, but it's a working lunch.  ah, solitude.  Something i won't enjoy again until i deal with jesse, The neighborhood shithead.    hey, dexter.    hey.    dexter, i was looking for you.  Hello, debra.    hi.    may i? yeah.  frank lundy.  anton briggs.  my lover  Friend.  my boyfriend.  all of the above.    so, dexter, i was wondering if you'd gotten The blood tox results back on tarla grant yet?   yeah, i should check on that right away.  please, finish your lunch.  all done.    tarla grant, just like you said: 36 years old, Married, mother of two.  that's a shame.    i found the matching what's that? big case we're working on.    i'm afraid i've enlisted debra in another of my mad theories.  ah.  What's it all about? finding out who killed her.  oh.    i don't suppose you happened to bring the, uh  Read the husband's statement from 30 years ago.  Family never believed it was a suicide.    but since trinity never leaves a trace, There was nothing to investigate.    you give good room service, angel.    you know, we should do lunch out more often.  missed one.    no arrests since she got busted With rose back in high school.  Spotty job record, but that's about it.  it's a stretch, i know.  Nikki? Nikki wald? I'm not sure miss nikki wald is home.  okay.  Hey, i'm sergeant batista from miami metro homicide.  it's rose.  get down! Shots fired, 41st and andrews.  we need backup! Good?   yeah, i'm good, let's go.    suspects johnny rose and nikki wald going northbound On 41st street in a white sedan.    i think it was gray.    a light colored sedan.  Make? model?   suspects are armed and dangerous.    rita thinks i'm with the neighborhood watch.  Truth is, i'm gonna do a little more than watch.  There's dad, off to his weekly poker game.  And if i were the delinquent son, I would take advantage of my father's absence.  Going after him feels very familiar, Except it won't have its usual satisfying ending.  The best i can do is scare a little sense into this kid.  hey! Come on, it's the vandal.  let's get him! oh, fuck.  It's watch and report, assholes.  Not watch and chase.  This is so humiliating.  go that way.    this neighborhood's gonna kill me.    already? i mean, the kids aren't even dressed yet.  i know, i know, i'm early.  Just wanted you to see the latest work of the vandal.  Happened in the middle of the night.  He obviously smashed the window, released the emergency brake, Gave it a shove, and, uh, let it roll.  so dangerous.  is that cody's bike? oh, my god.  What if he had been out here playing?   these dummies share the same size and weight distribution As our victim.  At this height, any variant in trajectory Resulting from a simple jump or being pushed off the building Will be evident in where they land.    what if she took a running leap?   people don't kill themselves that way.  They just let go.  Oh, hey, either of you interested in buying tickets To the dolphins game? club level? I'll let them go for 500 bucks.    where'd you get those?   dexter.  son of a bitch.    come on, we have dummies to drop.    is he gonna pay me for those? Must be weird for you  Lundy coming back.    why would it be weird? you're weird.    none of my business, i know.  But if i loved someone, And that person was gone, And then i moved on, and then found someone else, And then that first person all of a sudden showed up again, I don't know  i've never had that problem.  But it's gotta be a little confusing.  maybe.  A little.    so then maybe if you know that it's supposed to be Weird and confusing, Then maybe it's a little easier to handle.  thanks.    it's always the same three kills with trinity  A young woman in a bathtub, Followed by a mother falling to her death, And ending with a man getting bludgeoned.    i put her in a short shirt so that we can see her panties While she's falling.  specific.  How many times that you know of?   i've got the bits and pieces That add up to at least 15 cycles.  Since we just turned the clock back another 15 years, I'm sure there are considerably more.  wow.  That's impressive.  In a very evil way.    what's really impressive is that i can't prove a thing.  Could never get anyone at the bureau convinced.  He's that good.    why do you think he's so successful?   trinity's likely someone who's gone his own solitary way Through life, So preoccupied with his own obsessions That he's foregone all but the most rudimentary Of human connections.  a lone wolf.  exactly.  It's a little bit disturbing.  yeah.    i mean i could just as well Be talking about myself.  Sure, i've been married.  Was married for 29 years, happily.  But even so, The only thing that really got my heart beating Was the hunt.  I'm sure you can't relate.  no, sorry.  and now here i am at 60, Watching dummies fly off a roof, Still on the hunt.    it sounds like trinity is worthy prey.    what's really got me intrigued Is the notion that he's returned to miami.  he's come home.    i'm not sure \"home\" is the right word.  People like us don't really belong anywhere.  We just pass through.  drink up.  You're next.  the vacation murders.  Word is, you know who johnny rose's accomplice is.    forget it, you'll get the press release same time As everyone else.  But my sergeant and lieutenant were almost killed yesterday, So if you put any negative spin on it, i'll be very angry.    when you're angry, you're very sexy, So this could be sort of a win win for me.    let's just say i'll be angry in a very withholding Sort of way.  okay.  The bathtub murder?   still under investigation.    the jumper at the old port building? ditto.  I gotta run.  see you tonight? sure.    can you just go over the figures one more time? they're not gonna change.  The test results indicate that tarla grant jumped, Rather than was pushed.    i don't buy it.  I think we're looking at a murder victim.    deb, we also got the autopsy report.  She had a small tumor.  Talked to the husband.  they just found out last week.  Maybe she was taking the easy way out.    maybe she was determined to fight it.  That doesn't mean she killed herself.  I checked her cell phone records.  No text messages, no suicide note.  not everyone leaves a note.  i just got word.  We will be debriefed on our shooting incident In the morning.  okay, good.    we need to get our stories straight About why we left the precinct at 12:30 And didn't get to wald's apartment until after 3:00.    we grabbed some lunch and then we had a flat tire.  flat tire it is.  you okay? i've read masuka's notes.  That, along with the autopsy reports, Leads me to believe that there's no reason To keep tarla's case open as a murder investigation.    lieutenant, i think it's premature to close it.  Lundy has this theory    you don't work for lundy.  You're welcome to pursue this, but between the vacation murders And lisa bell, i think you're gonna be very busy.    you're on your own with this one.  poor cody.  Ouch.  Where'd the glass come from? that car on elliot's lawn.  Cody was coming back from their pool, And he stepped on a piece.  does he need stitches?   no, he's fine, he's just scared.  First his bike, now this.    poor guy.  give him a hug for me.  hi.  Help me out here, dexter.  I've been going out of my way trying to make things good With you, but no matter what i do, You just throw it back in my face.    you don't need to make things good with me.    come on, what's it gonna take? quinn I don't care if you're a dirty cop.    if i didn't take that money, it would just sit Inside a locker until some fatass Who sits behind a desk grabs it to buy new carpet For his office which he never leaves.  I put my life on the line every day.  I give this job everything i've got, And i can't even afford a down payment on a condo.    i thought you had family money.    had, and that has nothing to do with anything.  Just don't fucking call me dirty.    the last thing i need is a cop mad at me.  Look, you're right, i take it all back.  I honestly don't give a shit.  Just keep my sister out of it, okay?   you don't understand any of this, do you? You can't, 'cause you're not a cop.  You're not one of us.  Cops: another community i'm not part of.  what? it's so crowded in there.    well, i guess so.  a wife and three kids.  they're always there.  tell me about it.  It was easy living with anton when he was never home.  I'd come back to a quiet apartment And unwind without having to deal with anybody.  Now, as soon as i walk through the door, he's there, Waiting to engage.  there's no escape.  and now lundy shows up.  is that good or bad? i have no fucking clue.  what?   we're complaining because people want to be with us? How lame is that? You think tarla grant killed herself? no, i don't.    masuka said she wasn't thrown or pushed from the building.  She jumped.  what would make her do that? fear is a powerful motivator.    you should go inside.  you're home.    thanks.    yeah.    hi.    hi, sweetie.  where is everybody? i'm in here.  fort cody.    hey, buddy, how's your foot? it's better.    good.  keep holding down the fort.  okay.    and i'll take care of my end Once you guys go to sleep tonight.    you may want to talk to astor.    this is one of those moments when i wish I was like everyone else.  I'm sure other people would know what to say.  Hey.  I know you're not a little kid anymore.  duh.  i'm sorry.  It's just Sometimes i'm Dumb.  it's okay.  You can be dumb.  thanks.  what? it's funny.  A few months ago, after a shoot up like this, People saw me leaning against you, They wouldn't think twice.    they still wouldn't think twice.  They don't know anything about us.  i know.  But i think twice.  I'm constantly worried that people will misinterpret.  let them misinterpret.  Hey I need this as much as you do.  this dexter guy.  First of all, who the fuck is named dexter? oh, that feels good.  What, did his parents know he was gonna grow up To be a fucking egghead?   i met him.  he seems okay.  he's a lab geek.  Fuck, that feels good.  what else?   what else? i'm exhausted.  I spent all afternoon in the sun Throwing dummies off a warehouse, 'cause super agent lundy has a hunch that The dead woman is connected to this big serial killer case.  hmm, really?   oh, yeah.  lundy always gets his man.  yeah? Well, so do i.    this is where i first noticed the pattern.  Raleigh, north carolina, 1993.  that got you curious?   then i found san francisco, louisville, Detroit, richmond.  Eight different cities in all that i know of.  Never the same place twice.  Until now.  Ready for another? oh.  yeah.  So now this is your little retirement project? You're completely incapable of relaxing, aren't you?   that's just it.  this is how i relax.  I get the scent of a bad guy, I can feel my blood pressure go down.    and here i thought i was bad.  you are.  You're exactly the same as me, Just in a much prettier package.    are you flirting with me, agent lundy?   simply stating the truth, miss.  thank you.  Excuse me just a second.  Hey.    hey, so you want me to order some takeout? i'm still working, So i'll just grab something here.    okay, well, i love you, babe.  me too.    ah, jesse, hard at work.  big surprise.  I'm gonna wait in your room and scare the shit out of you.  Jesse! If you're in here Andy! Apparently i'm not the only one Who isn't exactly what he seems.  Is that the wrench you use to break windows?   what the heck?   don't move.    okay, what's going on? who are you?   you're gonna stop breaking things, Stop rolling cars down the street.  Stop everything you've been doing.  If you so much as touch another window, I will come back here, And i will leave with your head in a bag.  I already have the bag.  fuck you! Let go of me, you fucking asshole! Fuck!   you really don't know what you're doing here.    i know exactly what i want to fucking do, Piece of fucking shit.  You should've seen their faces.  Those boxes in their driveways with their big fucking Flat screen tvs.  \"oh, look at us, aren't we so fucking rich?\" They're lucky the only thing i broke Was their fucking windows.    and you're lucky i don't break your fucking neck.  It's over.    fuck you, it's over.    give up.    no! I played by the rules my entire life.  And look what it got me.  My wife's dead.  i lost my job.  My son hates me, and now The bank wants to take my house away.  So if you want to take my fucking head, you take it.  i said stop.  You want me to come back for your son's head too? what? no! Not my boy! It's all i have!   you're gonna save what's left of your family, Save what's left of yourself.  Because all that other stuff Is over.  Say it.  yeah, it's over.  Bad news for andy is he's lost his house.  Good news for me is he'll be out of the neighborhood.  But why should i care about him? It's his world.  People like him made it this way.  At least he had a chance to belong.  it's still there, dex.  A stain so deep it can't be erased.      Previous EpisodeNext Episode"

        "script": "Previously on dexter   dexter.    how's my favorite serial killer hunter?   the reason i'm in miami is because i'm convinced That these bathtub murders are connected To a series of murders all over the country.  It's always the same three kills with trinity.  You got woman in a bathtub, Followed by a mother falling to her death   you're next.    if this is the latest victim of lundy's trinity killer, Then he's a very different monster than i am.    lundy has this theory     you don't work for lundy.  You're welcome to pursue this, But between the vacation murders and lisa bell, I think you're gonna be very busy.    yes, i did come to miami to follow a case, But i have to admit i'm glad the killer chose this city, Knowing i'd find you here.    hey, good news! The sandpiper hotel wants to book my band For a one month gig.  Best of all it means no more time away from you.    wow, that's great.    i'm not gonna tell you who to date.  It's none of my business.  But you should know there's no such thing As \"off the record\" with reporters.  So watch the pillow talk with that woman.  Super agent lundy has a hunch That the dead woman is connected to this big serial killer case.  Lundy always gets his man.    well, so do i.    [laughs]   look, i was a little worried That people will misinterpret.    let them misinterpret.  I need this as much as you do.    the past few weeks, you have not been The most present father and husband.  My dark passenger is like a trapped coal miner, Always helping, always letting me know It's still in there, still alive.  [festive music] Everyone needs a vacation.  In my case, it's time off for bad behavior.  But i intend to make the most of this family trip That they're taking without me.    shotgun!   shotgun!   i called it first.    i called it inside.    it doesn't count if you call it inside.    does so! mom! dexter!   how about you switch every hour?   want to trade places? I stay home and You can stuff cousin marlene into some spanx On her wedding day.    i wish i could, but things are pretty hectic At the station.    you're not gonna work the whole time, are you?   i'll try not to.    you can't let yourself get to that boiling point again.  It's not healthy.  And i'd rather not have to lie to the neighbor again If you decide to smash any more security lights.    i hate that you saw me that way.    i'm your wife.  I want to know what's going on inside you.    i don't think you do.  Just recharge your batteries, all right? Enjoy your freedom.  Go wild.    rightgo wild.    have fun.  Say, \"good bye, dexter. \" all: good bye, dexter!   good bye, dexter! bye bye.    the kids left you a present in the kitchen.    just the thing to melt a father's heart.  Let the good times roll.  [festive music] Whoops! Three days.  to recharge my batteries.  'course rita doesn't know i'll be recharging With another woman.  Officer zoey kruger.  Pembroke pines patrol.  Eight months ago, officer kruger's husband and daughter Were killed during a home invasion.  Zoey was shot in the arm and foot.  She survivedobviously.  But there was one person who thought it was zoey herself Who killed her family.  The one person who always knows the truth of a crime   The blood guy.  [knocking at door]   morgan.  good to see a friendly face.  Aren't many around here.    nice to have an excuse to visit.  Even if i made it up.    with your caseload, I can't believe you have time to write a paper On feathering in blood swipes.    i have a small window for Uh, a side project.  I remembered at the spatter conference last spring, You mentioned something about a questionable swipe In a case you were working.  Who was it, cooper?   kruger, and shh   we don't talk about that.    zoey's husband   shot in the stairway.  Her daughter, in her bedroom.  Zoey said she was shot twice Wrestling the shooter's gun from him.  And turned it on him as he fled.    that blood swipe Belongs to darius rae, A drug dealer zoey roughed up The day before her family was murdered.  According to her, She winged him in her front hallway.    the feathering is textbook.  Why'd you say it was questionable?   because it's the only blood of rae's Anywhere at the scene.    interesting.  For my paper.    my theory? Uh, forget it.  doesn't matter.    you think she planted the blood herself?   maybe she even provoked That confrontation with darius rae.    that's where she got his blood.    also gives her the perfect narrative for the crime.  Rae breaks in looking for retribution, Cop's family becomes collateral damage.    was darius rae ever arrested?   darius rae was gunned down In a supposedly gang related incident.  But that's another theory, Another day.  I try not to think about it.  Because if i'm right, There's a monster walking around free.    with a badge and a gun.  Zoey said she aimed at darius rae But only winged him.  But zoey always hits her targets.  Just ask her husband and daughter.  I'm feeling recharged already.  Monsters come in all shapes and sizes.  Sometimes it's the very people Who are supposed to be protecting us: A cop, a parent, The spatter guy.    god, close the door, will you? Here's a bludgeoning from july.    the one we're looking for will be five days After the suicide.    right.  Here's a middle aged guy from october   sorry, i thought this was my lab.    we're hiding from laguerta.    quinn's reporter fuck buddy has now officially Fucked all three of us.    \"catching the vacation murderer \"may not be the department's top priority.  \"detectives spent last thursday indulging the pursuits \"of retired fbi man hunter Frank lundy. \" It's a good picture.    i'm guessing that lieutenant laguerta's Open door policy with me is about to close.    we've got to narrow down trinity's next move.    bludgeoning.  Final kill in his cycle?   and he's repeating his pattern from 30 years ago, So if we can find where he bludgeoned back then     then maybe we can keep the next trinity victim From becoming the next trinity victim.    where's masuka?   on vacation?   he's probably in mexico taking a donkey show tour.    there's a briefing in five minutes.  Agent lundy   my visitor's badge is expired?   sorry.    crap.  fuck.  I guess we'll have to stake out potential bludgeoning sites On my off hours.    hey.  I don't want this theory of mine to jeopardize your job.    i want in on this.    well, okay then.    okay then.    you ever feel like you're this close to nabbing somebody?   sometime in the next 67 hours.    it's a good feeling.    oh, my god! I can't believe he posted that.    you are so busted.    i'm busted? Okay, it's totally photoshopped.  The point is, it looks real, so   you're busted! [giggles]   shh!   i know, i know, My dick's been making some bad decisions.    so according to quinn's girlfriend, These vacation murders are costing the city a day.    well, at least the article got the tip line ringing.  Those assholes can't hide With all those eyes on them.    well, those eyes are on us too.  [sighs]   uh oh.    whatoh?   that sigh thing you do when, you know, There's something i'm not gonna like.    i don't do a sigh thing.    okay, you don't.  What was it that you were gonna say?   [sighs] I think we should inform the brass about our relationship.  Look, it's just a formality.  Paperwork.  entirely confidential.    it's none of their business.    it's department policy for good reason.  We will catch these killers, And a defense attorney could use the details Of an off the books romance between us To sensationalize the case, distract the jury     if they find out.    on a death penalty case.    okay, they will find out.  But not for a while.  And what would we even report to the brass?   well, that we're seeing each other.    what does that mean?   what do you think it means?   it means it's new.  We're still figuring it out.    so this could just be a passing thing.    no, it's not a passing thing.    then what is it?   i don't know.    well, i don't know either.    i'm confused.    yeah.  I can see that.    can we justwait?   fine.    as a cop, zoey has been to plenty of crime scenes.  She knows what should be there.  And what shouldn't.  No prints in the blood on the door, Which means she wore gloves.  She was still wearing gloves when she shot herself.  But they were gone when the emts arrived.  Where'd you leave those gloves, zoey?   easier to think here, isn't it? Only 52 hours of freedom left.  You sure chose an interesting person to spend it on.    don't read anything into it.  Zoey was a challenge, that's all.    a woman who wiped out her own family In order to be free.    she should have shot herself Instead of her husband and child.    yeahexcept that doesn't get her free.  Just dead.    well, she had other options.    alimony.  visitation.  Trading off holidays   there go your weekends.    fine, she could have moved away.    and forfeit her job, her home? Her only option was to make her vacation from her family As permanent as possible.    there are always alternatives.    why do you think trinity's been so successful?   he travels a lot.  Stays on the move.    he doesn't have a family.    well, i do.    miss them yet?   all right, trinity used a hammer In portland and in fresno, But wasn't it a tire iron in albuquerque? Okay, all right.  We'll go with the dude that was pulverized by the hammer.  Where was that? Okay, what time tomorrow? Great.  Pad thai, my favorite.    mmm.  How's frank lundy?   i didn't say that was lundy.    oh, your voice did.  It goes up a notch every time you talk to him, Which you're doing a lot of lately.    your point?   i get a gig in town to spend more time with you.  You spend all your time with your ex.    our relationship is strictly professional.    you twist your hair when you talk to him?   you have nothing to be jealous of When it comes to frank lundy.  All right?   poker night at home.  Zoey's police family surrounds her On and off the job.  Between her buddy system and her security system, Her house will be difficult to break in tonight.  But not tomorrow.    [whistles]   [belches]   cunt.    what the hell did you just say?   you're a cunt!   [laughs] Fuck off, old man.    fucking pussy.  [groans]   you looking to get the shit kicked out of you?   [whimpers] faggot! [whimpers]   you gonna shut up now?   faggot.  Faggot.  [grunts] [moans] It's your fault.    the fuck is wrong with you?   all your fault.  [coughs]   the living room is here to the left, Kitchen in the back, And way out back is the hot tub.  Oh, welcome, welcome, welcome.  Oh, you're gonna love this house.  [laughs] Newer construction, only one previous owner, All sorts of upgrades.  Come on, let me show you its special wonders.    uh, would it be all right If i discovered those special wonders on my own?   any questions, just holler.    okay.  I do have one question.  Where did zoey stash her gloves? I'm sure they're long gone, But they could have left trace evidence.  She swiped the door with blood here Shoots herself, collapses Crawls toward the kitchen to call 911.  Did she burn them? If the gloves melted, there would be residue On the underside of the grate.    it's just for show.  Who needs a fire in this climate? I'm zoey.  i live here.    hey.    i just thought i'd stop by, See how the open house was going.    oh.  it's a nice place.    thanks.    family friendly.    mm.  I'll be glad to give you a tour if you're interested.    very interested.    okay, follow me.    wow, my daughter would go crazy over this room.    it's a little girl's dream.    may i ask why you're selling?   my husband and i are separated.  Now our daughter's with him.    so you're single.    i am.  You've been married long?   uh, yes, about six months.  Ah, that came out wrong.    [laughs] I understand.  believe me.    zoey, there's a couple here who have a question About the hot tub.    okay, i'll be right down.  To be continued.    sure.  A little girl's dream Follow the blood.  Follow the blood Zoey crawled into the kitchen, Grabbed the counter to pull herself up, Then reached for the phone, Giving her a perfect opportunity To use the garbage disposal.    how we doing in here?   uh, there seems to be a problem with the disposal.    oh.  [sighs] Oh, no, no, no.    it's probably just something jammed in there.  It's an easy fix.  Let me take a look.    you'd do that?   sure.  Blue nitrile.  The same material found in police protective gloves.  If the glove fits   isn't he a doll? Fixing the disposal.    huh.  Wasn't broken this morning.    give it a try.    all right.    yay!   if i was your wife, I'd hang on to you.  You're sohandy.    [chuckles]   so it's either The cannery bludgeoning or the bar beating.    the cannery body was a dump.  Trinity's not a dumper.  He picks a location, takes his victims there.    so it's the bar.    hmm.    fuckin' a.  We've found trinity's Oh! oh, no, oh!   here, here, here.    fuck me.    take the file, take the file.  No harm.  [clears throat] Um, mind if i?   yeah, sure, why don't you? So, uh, 30 years ago, A father of two was bludgeoned to death Between the hours of 7:00 and 10:00 p. m.  In the bathroom of murphy's tavern.    which is where i'll be today.    me too.    won't that be a problem with ashton?   anton.  And, no, he's coolsort of.    sort of?   he gets jealous for no reason.    he's a smart man.    look, don't make me come up with thought bubbles To put over those silent looks of yours.  Just say what you're thinking.    all right.  I, uh, i thought i could keep my feelings for you As background noise to this investigation.  But, in working with you, That noise has gotten   loud?   deafening.  But they're my feelings.    yup.  They're your feelings.    you're in a committed relationship.    i am.    and i would hate to   i'd hate that too.  Jesus.  I've gotta go.    will i see you tonight?   i don't Fuck!   is there a break in the vacation murders case?   i'm having intimate relations with laguerta.    congratulations?   i need some advice.    huh, lot of wise people out there.    i don't trust anyone else with this secret.    that's too bad.    maria has awakened mi pasion.    right.    when i'm with her, i feel like a man.  Like my heart is blossoming.    that's a problem?   no.  The problem is she wants to disclose Our relationship to the higher ups   Which i  i understand is a formality.  I just hate the thought of them knowing.    'cause you're embarrassed.    because once you define it, it's defined.  It's  it's officially official.    you're her boyfriend.    exactly.    next thing you know, you're moving in, Your life is gone, and it's just kids and neighbors And painted mugs.    painted mugs?   it's a metaphor.    for what?   look, if you want out, get out.  Before you have to do something drastic.    i don't want out.  i don't.  I just want to protect it By keeping it private.    yeah.    who knew it would matter so much to me? thanks, socio.  I'll keep you posted on the details.    great.  I am a stickler for details.    you still dating that she bag reporter? Is it that hard for you to get laid?   i'm not     after she put Lundy's name in the paper and ruined everything?   i'm not seeing her.    maybe you should have told her that.  News flash, quinn: you're an idiot.    yeah, i got your messages.    but you didn't call me back.    tell me, is this conversation gonna end up in the paper too? 'cause you have no idea the shitstorm you've gotten me into.    i'm sorry.  Really, but we can work this out.    i'm not interested in working it out.    don't say that.    come on, it's not like this was a big deal.    don't you dare tell me there's nothing here.    you're right, i won't.  But it's way too complicated.    i don't want to lose you.    christine.  you never had me.  Find yourself another source.    on vacation, we buy snow globes, Send postcards to preserve the good times, Remind us where we've been.

You didn't mention that you were a, uh, spatter analyst, Miami metro.    didn't seem relevant to house hunting.    hmm.  Well, the file clerk at my station   He's a friend.  He told me that sam had pulled my case file, And sam told me he'd loaned it to a colleague.  You can imagine my surprise when i looked up that colleague And saw your face.    i am writing a paper on blood swipes.    are you getting off on this?   am i supposed to be?   you're the kind of sicko who likes watching A woman in pain?   not that kind of sicko, no.    i lost my husband.  I watched my child die in front of me.  Do you have any idea how agonizing that was?   agony would be the normal reaction.    i will not let that wound be reopened.  Do you understand?

She knows who you are.    she knows who dexter morgan lab geek is.    she knows where you live, Where your wife and children will be when they get home In 48 hours.    if i back off, she backs off.    still leaves you on the radar of a killer cop Who has no qualms about shooting her family, Much less a lab rat.    she's stalking me.  Taking her by surprise will be out of the question.    you're the one who wanted a challenge.  And now you've batted the beehive.  [beeps]   dexter, frank lundy here.  Sorry to bother you at home.  I was just trying to reach your sister.  Thought she was maybe with you.  I had an interesting encounter today.    me too.    gotta admit, she is impressive.  Makes you wonder why someone like her Ever got married and had kids in the first place.    someone like her? Someone like her needs to be in control.    and she thinks she is.    she won't see me coming.  [phone rings]   pembroke pines police department.    records, please?   transferring.    records, langsbury speaking.    uh, yeah, this is miami metro forensics.

To whose attention?   just, uh, forensics.  Batting the beehive.    dexter.  I know everything.    i'm gonna choose not to misinterpret that.    when angel said he told you about us, i was Angry, to say the least.    i really didn't want to know.    but now you do.    yeah.    actually, i'm glad because I could really use a man's opinion on how to handle Our relationship.  Or fling, or whatever it is that he and i are doing naked.    well, i was just going to lunch.    that's great.  Beth's cafe sound good?   oh, actually, we should just talk here.  It's more private.    yeah.  Angel's a great cop.  the best i know.  But he doesn't understand the politics in this building.  And we have to manage how this thing becomes public.  And if it's handled wrong, our jobs could be at risk.  And we can't take that chance.    inever leave anything to chance.    thank you.  You're getting good at this relationship stuff.  Mm, marriage agrees with you.  Thank you.    lundy called last night.  he was trying to reach you.    [laughs] That is just so Fucking great.    okay.  Looks like the beehive is buzzing.  And here comes the sting.  You're out of your jurisdiction, officer kruger.  Wait for it.    [stammers] what are you doing?   you want info on darius rae? Ask me anything.    that file was for a case i'm working.    i asked you nicely to leave me alone.    you threatened me.    you think that was a threat?   what, are you gonna murder me too? Like you murdered your family? Your own daughter?   you're sick.    i know what you did.  I have proof.    not possible.    from the garbage disposal, The gloves you wore that night.  There was gun residue on them.  I have a meeting with my superiors tomorrow morning To tell them everything.    there's no chain of custody.    still, it'll raise questions.  And if you left this much behind, We'll find something else.    you're trying to rape me.    i'm not touching you.    that's why you came to my house.  And the real estate agent will testify that You were flirting with me.  And then you stalked me here and tried to assault me.  And i had to defend myself.    except The blowback of my blood into the muzzle of your gun Will show a flat contact shot That's highly unlikely during a struggle.  You could shoot me center mass, But the low directionality will show I was in a defensive position.  You'd have to calculate the exact distance To create a spatter pattern that supports self defense.    go ahead.  Tell them.  No one is going to believe you Over me.  So please.  Tell them Everything.    you won't give me the chance.  I'm counting on it.  [knocks]   debra.  You're here.  I called because, trinity, i     shut up.    this time she won't come in a squad car.  This time it won't be about threats and intimidation.  This time, it's for real.  They're all props, The camouflage of a family man.  She'll believe them.  She has no idea who i am, But i know exactly who she is.  Marco Polo.    she's going to make it look like i walked in On a home robbery, Got myself killed.  She's good at creating the narrative of a crime.  That hand's the first thing i cut off.  [grunts]   [cries]   surprise.    [grunts] Help! help! Help! Sorry, sorry, i was just buying your tickets.  You're taking a boat out of the country.  Eventually you'll land in the philippines.  You're smart, there's no extradition treaty there.    i'm not going anywhere.    i know something about creating a narrative too.  Suitcases packed, your car will be left at the port, And the blue glove is back in your disposal.  You'll flee the country.  You'll  whoosh   never be caught.  You're that good.  Or that dead.    you're gonna rape and kill me?   [laughs] what is it with you and rape? No one's raping anyone.  Mm, killing on the other hand.    why are you doing this to me?   why did you do this to them?   it was darius rae.    no, you wanted out.  You wanted your freedom.  From the constant demands They took it all.  And they wanted more.    i couldn't breathe.    you did it to survive.    you understand.    i understand, all right.    look at you.  What kind of father does this? What kind of husband? [groans]   not the kind who kills his family.    you're going to have to choose.    not what you chose.    you can't hide what you are.    oh, i can.  I'm better at it than you.    you will choose your life over theirs.    i won't.  I'd rather risk them knowing the truth Than lose them.  Wow.  [sighs] I don't want to lose them.  I don't.  That's the difference between us.    [groans]   nice souvenir.  Sure you don't want to stay here?   you didn't raise a loner, dad.    maybe i should have.    i'll survive.    you sure? Better see to that drip, son.  You don't want this place going to hell.  You need it too much.    my own little vacation spot.  [phone rings] Hey, how you guys doing up there?   we're on our way.  We left right after the wedding.  We should be home soon.    good, i'm glad.    the house!   don't hurry.  drive safe.  You're home!   yeah, we made it.  The wedding was exhausting.  The kids were a nightmare.  Just wanted to strangle them.  Oh, no.    yeah, it just slipped out of my hand.  Sorry.    oh, the kids will be excited to make you a new one.  [sighs] [sighs softly] I missed you so much.    i missed you too.    i'm a fuckwad.    you're not a fuckwad.    i knew.  From the second i saw you at the station, I knew how i felt.  It's how i've always felt.  I just wouldn't admit it.  'cause i'm a fuckwad.    you're human.    and now i've cheated on a guy Who doesn't deserve to be treated that way.  I should have broken up with him first.  But i'm a fuckwad.    no.  don't.  You're not.  You're beautiful.  And you were confused.  And now you're not.  So We'll set this right, together.

So many pieces.  Assemble them right, A picture forms.  If it was trinity, It'd explain why deb is alive and lundy isn't.    trinity's a monster.  If he was the one who hurt your sister, You need to kill him.  That was my blood down there too.  You can't let these be logged into evidence.    not until i have a complete picture.    police so far are refusing to comment On the murder of a former fbi agent And the shooting of a miami metro Homicide detective.  But channel nine has learned There may be a connection To the so called vacation murders.  Sources tell us that   all right.  denver omelet, side of rye toast.  Can i top that off for ya?   coffee's fine, But there are no diced tomatoes in my omelet.    i'm sorry about that.  Cook is slammed today.  I'll bring you a side of tomatoes.  How's that coffee?   my coffee's not the issue.  My breakfast, on the other hand, is.  You need to start over.  Denver omelet with tomatoesdiced.    coming right up.    you're a dear.  thanks.  [cell phone rings]   astor, will you get that?   but it's dexter's.    oh, it's okay.  He was in such a hurry he probably forgot it.  Could be the hospital.    is aunt deb gonna die?   oh, no, honey.  no, she's gonna be okay.    some man.  he says he's dexter's landlord.  There's something wrong with dexter's apartment.    oh, there's got to be a misunderstanding.  Uh, yes, hi.  this is rita morgan?   how long have you been there?   not long.  You're sitting up.  It's a good sign.    i'm fine.  I didn't even need surgery.  Couple stitches.    looks like more than a couple.  You have any pain?   no.  just tired.  Whatever they gave me has some kick.    you want me to come back?   it's okay.  i'm fine.    you remember anything at all? You see anything unusual?   it's all still a blur.    who was hit first? You, or  ?   jesus, dex.    am i squeezing too tight?   i expect those kind of questions From batista or quinn, But not my brother.    you said you were fine.  Twice.    doesn't matter, anyway.    just tell me what you want me to do.    that's just it.  You can't do anything.  No one can.  I didn't feel anything.  I didn't even know i'd been hit Until i was on the ground.  And then two more shots.  So much blood.    you're safe.  I'm here.    lundy had this look in his eyes.  Like he was apologizing.  I couldn't do anything.  I was helpless.  Fuck, i can't even walk Three feet to the bathroom.    do you need to  ?   yeah.  bad.    come on.  Okay?   mm hmm.    i may not know who shot my sister, Or why her life was spared, But i do know i won't be returning the favor.    oh, god.  deb, is she  ?   peeing.  I'll just  uh Be outside.  Hey.    how's deb?   she's lucky to be alive.    i was so worried.  Can i see her?   uh, she's peeing.  With anton.    i would have been here sooner, But i got hung up on the phone.  Your landlord called.  A pipe burst in your kitchen At your apartment?   oh.  I was just hanging on to the place Until the lease ran out.  So i could get the security deposit back.    why'd you tell me you got rid of it?   i said that? [harrison crying]   talk about this later.  This isn't the time or the place, Not with deb here.  Family comes first.    i'm just so sorry i wasn't here.    you don't have to keep saying that.    so glad you're all right.    i'm not.    babe, what is it?   i slept with lundy.    i thought you were happy.    i thought i was too.  I can move out.    no.  no.  no.  Listen, i'll see you through this, okay? You did the same for me.    anton, stop.  You deserve so much better.    is that what you want?   sorry i hurt you.    anton?   [speaks spanish]   gracias.  Just hung up from notifying lundy's daughter.    then you could really use A shot of whiskey in there.  I get that the guy's personally invested in this, But matthews hovering around like a vulture Isn't gonna help us catch bad guys.    angel I made official disclosure yesterday That we're seeing each other.    we talked about this.    i know.  But it was the right thing to do.    i said i was uncomfortable with the disclosure stuff, And you go ahead and do it anyway?   i made a judgment call.    the problem, maria, Is that you made it for the both of us.  You shouldn't keep the deputy chief waiting.    [sighs]   what do we got?   not much.  No witnesses, no security cameras.  Took a statement from deb, She can't remember seeing anything.    forensics.    waiting on trace and ballistics from the lab.    apbs out on rose and wald.  County's increased patrols at the airport And the higher profile tourist hotels.    if my face was all over the media For shooting a cop and a fed, I'd be digging a fucking hole All the way to china.  No one fuckin' go there.    or you'd be watching the press To try and stay one step ahead of us.  It's a hail mary, But i planted a story With quinn's girlfriend.    she's not   we're not     you're the paper's unnamed online source About johnny boy's drip?   i figure if johnny has syphilis And nikki wasn't listed by the county As one of his sexual partners   she may not know.    exactly.  Maybe we turn these two against each other.    rita was right.  Family does come first.  Finding who did this to my sister comes first.  Is this a new page of the code? Revenge? My sanctuary.  It's private andsacred no more.  If i have to give up this place, What will i do about my roommate, The dark passenger? This apartment is the only thing That's helped me keep the mask in place.  Without it I'll burst.  [cell phone rings]   they're letting me out tomorrow.    that's great.    any chance you can give me a ride?   of course.    i'm also kind of gonna need a place to stay.  I broke up with anton, And, no, i don't want to talk about it.    we can make room for you.    rita won't mind?   don't worry, deb.  i'll take care of everything.    trinity's a lone wolf.  Unable to connect.  Except with his victims.  He never deviates.  Bleeds out a young female in a bathtub, Forces a woman to jump to her death, And five days later Bludgeons an older male.  I'll look at potential sites.  This may be the closest to trinity i've ever been.    lundy got closer than he thought.    he just couldn't see how all the pieces interlock, What they form.  A sacred ritual.    if there's anyone who knows the importance of ritual, It's you.    lundy underestimated How far trinity would go To make sure his ritual Wasn't interrupted.    lundy was an obstacle.    and trinity killed him.    if anyone has ever deserved to be on your table, It's this son of a bitch.    can i help you?   i'm taking on a project.    how big?   almost more than i can handle.  And i don't have a lot of time.    maybe you need another hand or two.  There's plenty of laborers out there.    no, no.  i work alone.    sounds like you need the right tool for the job.    so much work.  But i have to finish what i started, right?   yeah, i  i guess.  [ominous music]   what would you do?   me? Oh, i'd go with the framing hammer.  Got a lot of heft.  It's versatile.  You can't go wrong.    i see what you mean.  You've been very helpful.    lobby's open 24 hours.  [tape fast forwards] hundreds of rooms.  Trinity could strike anywhere.  He'll have to set up shop in the surveillance room.  Trinity's the perfect predator   Camouflaged, waiting for his victim to be alone, And then he strikes.    trinity struck here A bartender, father of two, Was found bludgeoned to death In the men's room of a tavern At this same address.  If history is going to repeat itself, This is where trinity will be.    problem is, you have no idea who you're looking for.    lundy was so methodical, He would have commented on trinity's physical appearance If their paths had ever crossed, But there's nothing in his tapes.  I've listened to them all.    you sure about that? that's your recorder.  Where's lundy's?   it wasn't in the hotel, Because lundy had it on him.  Must have been logged into evidence  shit.    dexter, you need that tape.  You need to be certain It's trinity on your table.    there's still time.  He won't complete the cycle until tomorrow night.  And i'll be here.  Waiting.    oh, god! Oh! [moans, laughs]   that was, uh   unexpected.    that's not an adjective i usually hear.    i'm not complaining.  I'm just   I'm just wondering why you're really here.    my way of saying i appreciate you running that story For my boss.    okay.  hmm.  You fucked me to thank me?   technically, i went down on you To thank you.  [laughter]   i thought you said this was just too complicated, You being a cop and me being a reporter.    i guess i like complicated.    look who's here.    sorry, astor.  I promise it won't be for long.    it's okay.  i get cody's room.    sorry, cody.    come on, guys.  it's time to go to school.  Check in later.  [door closes]   everything all right between you and my brother?   we just need to have a talk.    it isn't about me staying here, is it?   no, you're family.  you're always welcome here.  I'm gonna let you get settled in, And i'm gonna get you some water For these pain pills, okay?   rita.  Thank you.  [dramatic music]   thanks for letting deb stay with us.    it was either here or your apartment.  Look, we can't keep putting this off.    it's still not a good time.  I need to get to the station.    so when do you suppose It'll be a good time To discuss why you lied to me? I'm really trying here, dexter.  [horn honks]   dexter.    i'm just asking for a little patience, all right? Not for me, but for deb.  Right now i need to focus on finding who did this.    okay.    you didn't come over last night.    so little time to sleep lately.  I thought i'd get more rest in my own bed.    i'm sorry i went behind your back to matthews.  It was wrong, and i apologize.  If you haven't noticed, I'm a bit of a control freak.    you mean like how like to guard the remote control With your life? Or how you need to be the first one in the shower Or how you like to     look, the reason i went to the brass Was because it'd be One less thing to worry about ruining what we have.    the only thing that would ruin what we have Is if we're not honest with each other.  No more secrets.    no more secrets.  [timer dings]   then i'm not going anywhere.    that's everything collected From the parking lot and the hotel rooms Back there on the right.    [sighs] thanks for doing this.  My father gave deb the ring, And it means the world to her.    i checked the inventories.  Masuka never logged it in.    yeah, deb doesn't remember if she was wearing it or not.  The shooting has her pretty messed up.  If my coming down here to double check Helps ease her mind, So be it, right?   yep.    ah, fuck.  Damn it.    you morgans and that mouth.    do you mind?   oh, yeah.  don't sweat it.  There's plenty more where those come from.    thanks.    here you go.    guess who just found her ring.  Sorry for the trouble.  Thanks a lot, though.    no problem.    i appreciate the personal tour.    any time i can do rounds With a fellow human being is a win.    you're alone every night?   yeah, economy's a bitch.  There used to be two of us on every shift, but now     oh, say no more.  I'm recently laid off myself.  From here on out i'm gonna be my own boss.    well, there's plenty of office space here.  You know, more tenants means more money.  Then maybe i won't have to do these double shifts And i can see my kids once in a while.  Oh, you end up setting up shop here, I guarantee this'll be your favorite destination Come lunch time.    right on schedule.  And you brought me a customer.    it's a future renter.    well, possible future renter.    can i get you any?   no, no.  Caffeine makes me a different person.  Appreciate the offer, though.  So you say you walk this whole place Every two hours? That's quite a workout.    my wife calls it low impact aerobics Or some shit like that.  It takes about 45 minutes, Give or take a smoke break.    well, we all have our vices.    so how'd you like the building? [elevator bell dings]   it's perfect.    great.    thanks a lot.    mm hmm.  [baby crying]   rita, i think something's wrong with harrison.    i know that cry.  Someone's wet, isn't he?   good.  Thought it was me.    oh, no.  No, harrison loves his aunt deb.  Can i ask you something?   i don't do diapers.    did dexter tell you he kept his apartment?   what the fuck? Are you kidding? He told me he got rid of it.    me too.  Just thought he might have said something Since you two are so close.    not a word.  God, it's like a morgan family curse or something   Make the worst choice possible.  At least dexter's don't get people killed.    you think you're responsible for lundy's death?   he never would have been anywhere near that parking lot If it weren't for me.    is that why your pain pills are in the trash? Punish yourself? What happened to lundy isn't your fault.  You had no control over it.  This isn't about choices Or even about you.  Sometimes bad things just happen.    that's the answer to this? Bad things happen?   life happens.    i've yet to find trinity's signature At any of his crime scenes.  [tape fast forwards] Trinity moves from state to state.  Law enforcement never links his kill cycles To one another.  Over 30 years of killing.    the cycle, the ritual, They tell me where trinity will be, But i have to know who i'm looking for.  I have to be sure.    lobby's open 24 hours.  Guard on duty.  Too much foot traffic.  Trinity'd have to choose another floor.    ooh.  sorry.    bus number 432.  Male.  Maybe 6'4\".  Age around 60.  Hair gray, eyes blue.  Something in them.    lundy saw a ghost.    okay, listen up, everyone.  I just got word there was a shooting at a motel.  You all need to get there as soon as possible, guys.  So quinn's already en route.  Angel, you're with me.  Masuka, grab your stuff.    what's going on?   motel shooting.  Body's a match for johnny rose.    i'm going with you.    you can't work this.  You're next of kin.  I've got it.  Let's just hope deb Is finally gonna get some justice.    that's the plan.    karma.  What a fuckin' concept.  uno, dos, tres.    the first bullet didn't quite make her point.    lieutenant, we've got nikki wald Cornered in the alley behind al's liquor store.    let's go.    prick.  Son of a bitch.  god.  [muttering]   what do we got?   found her in the alley.  Altered, agitated.  Every time we get near the gun goes up.    we good?   yeah.    why? why? [muttering]   nikki!   damn it.  He fuckin'   He fuckin' cheated on me.    we need you to put the gun down.    he ruined everything.  You fuckin' ruined everything.    she's wasted.  She doesn't even know where she is.  Cover us.    nikki.  No one's gonna hurt you.  We just want to talk.    the alley's sealed off.  You can't go anywhere.    did you hear that, johnny? What about the boat? What about bermuda, johnny? Wasn't that the plan? You piece of shit! [electricity crackles] aah! [cell phone rings]   we got 'em, morgan.    got who?   nikki walden, johnny rose.  well, we got nikki.  Johnny's on his way to the morgue.    what happened?   she fuckin' shot him.  long story.  Look, i know this doesn't change what happened, But hopefully you'll find some peace of mind Knowing this thing's over.    yeah.  Peace of mind.    i got to take this skank down to booking.  Congratulations, partner.    such a waste.  Lundy, those other tourists.  For what? a boat to bermuda?   hell hath no fury like a meth addict scorned.    your office, lieutenant.    was  was that a smile?   i don't know.    congratulations, maria.  That was really good police work out there today.    thanks.  But it was sergeant batista's good police work.    yes.  Well, i know he's an asset to your team, But this department can't risk A defense attorney turning your romantic involvement Into a courtroom sideshow Every time you work a case together.    what are you saying?   i am saying i need you to transfer sergeant batista Out of homicide.    tom, this is bullshit.  We followed protocol.  Christ, he made this bust.    which is why i'm going to make sure That sergeant batista gets a promotion Along with his transfer.  Have the papers on my desk by monday.  Sergeant.    fuck.  what is it?   while everyone's chasing their tails over nikki wald, I'm going after the man who really shot my sister.  In a few hours, the enigma that is trinity Will be on my table.  A riddle wrapped in plastic.  [cell phone rings] Morgan.    i need to see you.    i'm kind of in the middle of something.  Can it wait?   no.    well, i'm way over on the other side of town.  It'll take me at least an hour to get there.    i'm not home.  I'm where frank was shot.  You can't even see our blood.  It's like it never happened.    deb?   what the fuck's your problem?   i got here as fast as i could.    you have everything, And you're doing your goddamn best To throw it all away.    rita told you about the apartment?   what the fuck were you thinking? You have to make this right.    i'm not sure i know how.    you figure it out.  I'm the fuck up in the family.  not you.    don't say that.    you have a choice.  To be a good husband.  To be a good father.    i know.  It's just, uh Sometimes i feel trapped.    by what? Three kids? A wife who adores you? Yesterday, i had lundy and anton.  And now they're gone because of me.    you didn't do anything wrong.    it doesn't matter what i do.  Or what i choose.  I'm what's wrong.  There's nothing i can do about it.  If i'm not hurting myself, I'm hurting everyone around me.  There's nothing i can do about it.  I'm  i'm broken.  I'm     no, you're not.  I am.  Why don't we go back to the house?   don't! don't.  I need to be here.  Where lundy died.  I can't do a fucking thing about it.    my sister doesn't deserve to be in this kind of pain.  But i know who does.  Trinity hurt my sister, And i'm going to hurt him back, And it's going to feel   uh oh.    your manager let me in.  He had no idea we were married.  Funny thing is, i'm getting to wonder myself.    rita, you're upset.    i actually convinced myself That by coming here This would all make sense Why it was so important That you keep this place a secret.  [harrison whines] As i was coming over here, All i could think about   That you were using drugs again.  That you were having an affair again.    that will never happen.    i went through your cabinets, Rifled through your desk, Looking for anything That would explain What would be so horrible That my husband would have to keep a place To hide it from me Or his own sister.    and?   i was gonna break the lock, But i was too scared of what i might find.  And you know why? 'cause you put me in this position, dexter.  This is not the type of person or wife that i want to be.    you really want to know what's inside?   yes.    it was harry's.  I wasn't comfortable having it in the house with the kids, So i kept it here.  See? I have nothing to hide.  Except for the syringes, scalpels, and bone saw Hidden in that secret drawer underneath.    nothing to hide.  Like your car accident And your concussion and this apartment? The most disturbing thing About your lying is that I'm beginning to see Just how good you really are at it.  You should sleep here tonight.  When you're ready to come home, We have a lot of work to do If this marriage has any hope.    hey.  pulling an all nighter?   yep.  no rest for the wicked.    have a good one.    always do.    it's almost poetic   One serial killer Ending the 30 year reign of another.  Trinity could be anywhere in this building.  I've got to get To the security surveillance room.    huh.  where's that security guard? He was here last night.  [man whimpering]   i've been so focused on trinity, I've neglected who his victim might be.    the bludgeoning victim Didn't he have two kids?   it's the security guard.  [man cries out] [elevator dings]   if he's here   then where's trinity?   aah!   take the bait.  Take the bait.    [whimpering] oh, no.  Please.  I'm a father!   you were no father.    aah!   you made me You made me [thud]   the recording disc is gone.    where are you, trinity?   [grunting]   oh, my god.    you made me do this.    trinity.  [suspenseful music] Shit.    the elevators aren't moving.  He's using the stairs.    which one? I can't risk picking the wrong exit And miss trinity.  His car has to be here.  [gate raising] No way i lose you again, trinity.  [indistinct voices] In miami, nobody sees.    he's scurrying back To whatever hole he crawled out of.    the lone wolf thinks this is over.  [tires screech, horn honks]   asshole!   what the hell's he doing? Where are you going, trinity?   stay with him.  He's not getting away.    he doesn't belong here.  it doesn't make sense.    hi, honey.  Mmm.  missed you.    hey, kids.    daddy.    hey, dad.    lundy was wrong.  I was wrong.  Neither of us Knew pieces of the puzzle were missing.  Trinity's a husband, A father.  He's Like me.      Previous EpisodeNext Episode"

Do you remember shooting at   Quinn.  you shouldn't be here, morgan.  Watching this is only gonna fuck you up.  I'm already fucked up.  Look, nikki's going away for a long time.  She confessed to the vacation murders And to killing johnny rose.  But not to lundy.  The whole department knows she's lying, But we got nothing.  No evidence, no eyewitnesses, So it is what it is.  Fuck.  Fuck.  I came at nikki wald from every which way, But she's still holding out on us.  Brass wants her transferred to county.  So it's out of our hands.  Shit.  I didn't want to leave homicide With Deb and lundy unsolved.  That's out of our hands too.  I haven't told anyone yet About me transferring.  There's no need until it's official.  I haven't even turned in the paperwork.  Is that it? No, that's homicide.  Just come in today? This morning.  Didn't make sense to call you in on something new.  Bludgeoning.  Nasty.  You got any leads? Hey, if i'd known you'd be transferred Maria, don't.  Telling matthews about us was the right thing to do.  Working fraud will be good for me.  Promotion to lieutenant, better hours, And chances are I'm not gonna be getting shot at Sitting behind a desk all day.  You hate sitting behind a desk.  But I love being with you.  Blood, snot, tears.  But the emotions that go along with them, Not so much.  Dexter, are you hearing what rita is saying? She's upset.  About the apartment.  The apartment isn't really the issue right now.  It's not? You see? it's like he doesn't even listen.  He's always in his head, And when he does talk to me, It's all lies, all the time.  Not All the time.  I thought we were past this.  You know, with the drugs and lila.  Who's lila? my sponsor.  The homicidal bitch he slept with.  Okay.  Now we're married.  You know, we have a child together.  And you're still keeping secrets.  Rita, I can see that you're upset.  But, as you describe it, This isn't new behavior for Dexter.  What do you mean? It sounds like you knew about him When you married him.  What? I hoped he would change.  When you married your ex husband, Did you think he would change too? Okay.  okay, so I have some responsibility here too.  I don't want to keep making the same mistakes.  Me neither.  We'll work it out.  we always work it out.  I need a partner, Dexter.  Someone I can trust.  Unless you can be completely honest with me I don't want to do this anymore.  I'm doing everything I can to save my family, And I'm still failing.  Rita's picturing her life without me, And I can't picture mine without her Or the kids.  Harrison.  Is that the hammer? The depth is too shallow.  Murder weapon was heavier.  Well, narrow it down, Dex.  We need a model number.  Maybe we can track it to a hardware store Or an internet site.  I'll try this 22 ouncer.  What's going on? Dna.  Whose DNA? the victim's? The killer's? wait for it.  Okay, that smudge You found at the crime scene? Cremated human remains.  That fragment was a little piece of bone.  And thanks to the wonders of technology And to my own scientific prowess You rehydrated it and? Dude, I told you to wait for it.  And I found two strains of DNA.  One from the fragment And one from saliva.  Whose saliva? The killer's.  come on, buddy.  Try to keep up.  How do you think he got the ashes to stick to the wall? We got the killer's goddamn DNA? You f in' know it.  I rock, right? yeah, you do today.  Run it through every database you can think of.  Okay.  we're gonna find this guy.  No, you won't.  Arthur Mitchell isn't in any Of our police databases.  I already ran him.  he's squeaky clean.  He hides the real him, Except from those ashes.  He can only be honest with the dead.  Morgan.  I need those vacation murder files back.  Got to finish my report.  Just give me another hour.  There's got to be something that puts nikki at m.  I need to.  Morgan, we got it covered.  And you shouldn't be working anyway.  You're on sick leave.  Go home.  I'll keep you posted.  Okay? One unheard message.  Hi, I'm calling for debra morgan.  This is valerie hodges returning your call From a few weeks ago.  Sorry it took me so long To call you back, but when you said You were harry morgan's daughter, I wasn't sure what to do.  I figured i'd just call, be direct, So if you want to know the truth I told you to stop working.  That wasn't work.  That was way personal.  come on.  For you? same difference.  She wants a partner.  One who can open up.  Okay, I'll share.  About what? Work.  Spatter analysis? No.  something personal.  Trinity? too personal.  Food? I'm hungry.  I could tell her that.  We're out of bread again.  I'll go get some.  Arthur's kept this up for, what, 28 years? My family may not last 20 minutes.  Warmth, intimacy.  He's convincing.  But why the show? I'm the only one watching.  Unless it's more than just camouflage.  That's honest affection Sustained for years.  But he's like me.  how does he do it? I will kill him.  I need to.  But right now I need to save my family more.  His cycle is over.  It'll be a while before he kills again, So he's not an immediate threat.  And I have so much to learn.  Arthur Mitchell.  Kyle butler.  Four walls, one heart.  We build homes for the homeless.  We meet at my house, then head to the site together.  My address is right on the flyer.  Thanks.  I've been looking for a way to get more involved.  What brings you to sacred fellowship, kyle? Um Looking for something.  Answers.  My wife and i, we separated.  She kicked me out And took the kids.  I didn't know where else to go.  You came to the right place, son.  I just got an email from my editor.  Yeah? anything good? Well, he wants more from me on the vacation murders.  I'm not asking for any inside scoop.  Yeah, 'cause we know how well that worked out last time.  What? If you could just help me get an interview With debra morgan You got to be kidding me.  It'd be a hero piece About the shooting.  No.  no way.  She's your partner.  Yeah.  add to that the fact That her brother has a bug up his ass about me.  Let's just say i'd rather you left it alone.  Oh.  Since when did that ever stop me From getting what I want? Oh, hold on.  it might be the station.  Quinn.  Look out your window.  Be back in a sec, okay? Hey.  I want to be an eyewitness for the shooting.  I thought you said you didn't see anything.  I was in shock.  My memory was fuzzy.  Now it's clear.  There's no doubt in my mind That nikki shot me and frank.  Mine either.  Are you talking about going on the record? And what happens later If you decide you're still confused? I won't.  You sure? Because if this comes back to bite you in the ass, You're screwed.  My dad used to say a good cop Does whatever it takes to close a case.  Other cops.  not you.  Just think about it, okay? I'd hate to have you make a decision When your head's not on straight.  They're on a wild goose chase.  No way they'll find a match to trinity's DNA.  He's too well hidden.  I could be helping, Finding the hammer he used.  Or I could help someone in need   Me.  Preliminary spatter report On the bludgeoning.  We land on the specific hammer For the murder weapon? Narrowing it down.  I'll keep you posted.  I'm actually heading out now to do some field research.  Well, how about you, vince? You got anything for me on that DNA? No matches in the criminal database.  Duh.  Wait.  You're gonna miss the big reveal.  Because I'm me, and I happen to think outside the box, And I happen to be an awesome forensic tech   Masuka.  I ran the human remains against the saliva.  And guess what I found? Matching mitochondrial DNA.  English, por favor.  The killer is related to the human remains.  Same family.  He keeps his family with him all the time.  Well, are they gonna go visit him in prison? 'cause this is going to get him caught.  Maybe he wants to get caught.  Or he's sending a message.  Or he's trying to leave Some kind of a legacy.  Hey.  how come you're not working this case? I'm busy.  Got a report to finish.  His family keeps him safe, But these ashes leave him exposed.  Maybe this is how I get to the truth.  The murder weapon.  He's using it out in the open For all the world to see.  Not something I would do.  But Arthur has tools that I don't.  Hey.  glad to see you made it.  Kyle butler.  You remember my name.  Oh, I'm like an elephant.  I never forget.  You didn't have any tools to bring? Lost 'em in the move.  Well, here.  take my hammer.  Take good care of her, though.  We've been through a lot together.  So I saw.  Very kind of you, Arthur.  Well, generosity of spirit, kyle.  It's the reason we're all here.  Not all of us.  Come on.  I'll get you set up.  Okay.  Grant 24 ounce steel framing hammer, model number 514.  Laguerta will be pleased.  Just bang in these three.  They're already marked.  Uh huh.  But I have more important questions.  So, Arthur, you and your family been doing this A long time? oh, yeah, for years.  I took sally on a build for our very first date.  And the kids have been coming Ever since they could hold a hammer.  You all seem really close.  happy.  Yeah.  We are.  Envious.  You're Arthur's son, right? I'm kyle.  Oh, jonah.  Nice to meet you.  seems polite.  Well adjusted.  how's it going? It's hot.  It's nice that you're here, though.  There's got to be other ways You'd rather spend your afternoon.  Well, no, it's okay.  You know, mom and dad are big on the family time.  That's nice.  For too many kids, family time means fighting time.  Not mine.  never? Not much to fight about, really.  My parents are cool.  Yeah, your dad seems like a special guy.  He is.  I i really lucked out.  How so? A lot of ways.  like, you see that? It's been my dad's baby for years.  A few days ago, he hands me the keys.  Generosity of spirit.  Foundation of love, man.  Best dad ever.  Father of the freakin' year.  Oh, I got to get back to work.  Dad's not a big fan of idle hands.  Hey, nikki.  You remember me? Yeah.  that cop.  Detective.  The one you shot.  Jesus christ.  Here we go again.  I told your boss everything already.  Now you're gonna tell me.  Only this time you're gonna tell the truth.  I told you.  I've been telling the truth the whole time.  Well, then come here and tell it to my face.  This is so fucking stupid.  A bit closer so I can see your eyes.  The night that you got shot, I was in a hotel room with johnny.  Bullshit.  We did meth, We watched porn, we fucked.  I mean, we were watching cartoons all night.  What do you want? what do you want? You fucking liar.  No matter how many times you ask me, It's not going to change.  I didn't shoot you, okay? I didn't kill that old man.  Ow! fuck! jesus christ! I'm gonna say I saw you.  People get mugged every day.  Maybe somebody else wanted you dead.  Huh? like who? like who? Oh, fuck.  you're a fucking cop for christ's sakes.  You piss people off for a living.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  fucking hurting me.  You think that hurts? Try watching the man you love Die right in front of you with nothing you can do.  Oh, right.  You shot your boyfriend.  You nasty piece of shit.  I killed johnny.  I know.  I killed I do miss johnny.  I know.  If you   if you say That you saw me kill frank lundy, Then you're the liar.  You are the liar! I'd like to be transferred Out of homicide.  Always looking for the next best thing, Hey, lieutenant? aren't we all? Yeah.  I could use a change of scenery.  I'm thinking press liaison.  Well, p. r.  could certainly use your political skills.  And sergeant batista could stay in homicide.  Well, let me think about it.  We both know you're not easily replaced.  That didn't seem to be a problem before.  I'll let you know what I decide.  Hello.  Tell me that's the last of it.  The last bag from your apartment.  It's not from my apartment.  But, rita, wait, wait.  Surprise for you, for all of you.  No way.  a nintendo ds? I know it's not an ipod a mini dvd player? This is awesome.  For harrison.  And for my lovely wife.  A bread maker? We're always running out of bread.  We're always running out of milk.  Did you get me a cow too? Thank you so much! This is so awesome.  thank you, Dexter.  You're welcome.  What's the matter? you don't like your gift? I appreciate you trying.  I really do.  But we don't need gifts.  We need you.  Need me to do what? Just talk to me.  I'm, uh People just do this? Say what they're thinking? Out loud? How hard can it be? I'm trying.  I'm trying.  You know what? You can try harder in therapy.  I'm moving up our next session.  Wow.  What's the occasion? I have good news.  You want to guess? Um, you're naked under there, And I get to see? Guess what else you get to do? Okay, now I'm really having impure thoughts.  You get to stay in homicide.  Really? mm hmm.  Wow.  how did you   I had a little talk with the deputy chief, And I told him homicide couldn't afford to lose you.  And neither could i.  You Are Amazing.  Mm hmm.  So he's okay with both of us staying? Well, we can talk about logistics later.  Right? You told him you'd leave instead.  Angel.  It just makes more sense.  You're full of it.  You're sweet, and you're beautiful, But you're full of it, And I can't let you do that.  Well, I'm not gonna let you leave homicide.  You love it.  And if you leave, you won't be you.  At least not the you that I want to be with.  What do we do? I don't know.  How are we supposed to decide what's more important? Our jobs or each other? Shit.  Shit is right.  This is Arthur Mitchell At his core.  Is there something in his DNA That lets him keep a family? Some magic gene I'm missing? Looking for something? You're surfing on my turf, blood guy.  Just curious.  Then you'll be interested to know That the mitochondrial DNA Female.  So mother, daughter, Sister Could even be his granny he smudged on that wall.  Probably whacks off with her ashes.  Why would he do that? Why wouldn't he? Because she's important to him.  Dude.  joke.  His history with her shapes who he is.  Like how my mother breast fed me till I was six And now no one will ever match up.  Lieutenant.  It's a grant 24 ounce steel framing hammer.  Sorry? It's the murder weapon in the bludgeoning case.  I did some independent research.  Updated my report.  If it's okay with you, I have some personal stuff to take care of.  Oh.  Take care of the personal stuff, Dexter.  Take very good care.  Sure as hell trying to.  You know those things never go bad.  Well, yeah, tell me about it.  I've had these since I was a rookie.  So I never heard back from you about being an eyewitness.  That mean you changed your mind? Yeah.  Just 'cause nikki's a piece of shit And my dad was a lying sack Doesn't mean I have to be.  Thanks for talking some sense into me.  Just looking out for my partner.  What's all this? I'm thinking maybe nikki wald was telling the truth.  Since when? Since I talked to her myself.  Wait, you what? I've been going over everything you collected From lundy's hotel and All his personal effects.  Here's the thing.  Some of it's missing.  No way.  It was all logged in.  by me.  Lundy had research books On that serial killer he was hunting.  And audio tapes.  I saw them in his room.  You still wrapped up in that, deb? I don't mean to speak ill, But the guy was chasing a ghost.  I think that ghost stole his books.  You got to stop.  You're making yourself crazy.  I'm telling you, someone took lundy's stuff.  And I'm telling you, you got to let this go.  Look, I'm sure you're tired.  Why don't you go home   and what? Paint my fucking nails? I'm kind of sick of hearing it, quinn.  Then I guess I won't say it anymore.  I am no longer seeing lieutenant laguerta.  I mean, I see her every day, but We broke up.  Officially.  And permanently.  Are you sure? Because, frankly, I'm getting a little sick Of the back and forth.  I apologize for the inconvenience.  Well, it's middle school bullshit, lieutenant.  I really don't want to have this conversation again.  You won't have to.  We've both signed affidavits to make it official.  Our relationship didn't interfere With any ongoing investigations, And the department will not be held liable for any fallout.  Well, that's something at least.  For the record, neither one of us was sexually harassed.  Yeah, all advances were very welcomed.  And there was not nor will there be A hostile work environment.  So it's done.  We're both staying in homicide.  Let me be clear.  The paperwork you're filing is serious.  If I find out this is bullshit, There will be consequences.  Severe, career ending consequences.  Don't, angel.  It's over.  Right.  sorry.  I should get back to work.  This is the last of it.  My dark passenger'sstuff And the reason I can't let go of my apartment.  If I don't figure out how to hide this, I'm gonna lose my family.  Trinity has the answer.  He's kept his family close.  even after death.  Who did you lose, Arthur? Vera Mitchell.  Sister of Arthur Mitchell.  Found dead in a Bathtub.  Marsha Mitchell.  Jumped to her death off the collins canal bridge.  Henry Mitchell.  Died in an alley of a fatal head wound.  Sister, mother, father.  He's recreating their deaths.  Decade after decade.  Cycles of three.  I watched my mother get sawed into pieces.  Now I cut people up.  We both have skeletons, Which means we both get a closet to keep them in.  Arthur has a closet.  I know almost everything about you, Arthur, Except where you hide.  Ready or not, here I come.  Oh, my goodness.  kyle, you all right? Yeah, cut myself at the build.  I didn't think it was a big deal, But it won't stop bleeding.  Here.  Right out in the open.  There must be more he's hiding inside.  Come on in.  We got a first aid kit in the house.  Sorry.  No boots in the house.  Here, I'll get the kit.  You make yourself at home.  Thanks.  I will.  Tacky, but normal.  His secrets must be under lock and key.  Not the dirty laundry I'm looking for.  Shit.  Arthur has a place to put his lamp.  The dates and locations from lundy's books.  Arthur's been using four walls builds Around the country as a cover to kill.  And these are his trophies.  Hanging right up here on the wall Just like his hammer in the garage.  His blood slides.  He doesn't need a secret apartment.  He's hiding in plain sight, Right in the center of his family.  I'm the one who's lurking in the shadows.  And here she is, Arthur's own dark passenger   His sister vera.  The tank is low, But then, she's been on the road for 30 years.  Kyle! Hiding in plain sight is one thing, But this is your weak spot.  What happens when it's exposed? Come out, come out, whoever you are.  Okay.  Let's have a look at that hand Don't touch My sister.  I'm sorry.  I didn't know.  I can't breathe.  I'm sorry.  Forgive me.  I'm so sorry.  Jesus, Arthur, what the hell was that? It's just My sister She died when I was young.  It was very painful for me.  I understand.  I've lost people too.  Yeah.  have a seat.  If the ashes bother you so much, Why do you keep them out? Because she's a part of me, kyle.  Helped make me who I am.  But if your family ever saw you so upset They'd understand.  This is my home.  I can be myself here.  You make it sound easy.  I used to push people away Because of my past.  Even lost a relationship over it.  Like you.  But you changed.  Yeah, I met sally, Had my kids, And I realized The only way it was gonna work Is if I jumped in with both feet.  Jump in with both feet.  Uh huh.  And that saved your family? Kyle, My family saved me.  Wait.  I want to give you something.  For the next build.  I thought you should have your own tools.  It's the least I can do.  Thanks.  For giving me your murder weapon.  See you at the next build then.  Wouldn't miss it.  I want to be a part of this family.  And I know I need to jump in with both feet.  I'm glad, but I want to let you in.  Honestly, I don't know How.  I never learned.  No, of course you didn't.  God, i I mean, with your mother and   What about his mother? She was murdered right in front of him.  Wow, that's That's quite a history.  And it shaped who I am.  But I want to change.  Let me ask you a question, Dexter.  And i'd like you to be honest.  I'll try.  Would you say that you're afraid To let rita get close to you? Yes.  why? Because of my past.  Are you afraid she'll abandon you? Yes.  But rita is not your mother.  No, definitely not, but if she Ever sees me for who I really am Then what? You think I would leave? Yes, absolutely.  Oh.  Well, then you've got something to learn about me.  I married you because I want to get To know the real you.  That's what i've been trying to tell you.  Dexter.  Tell rita the truth.  Why did you keep your apartment? Because I need space To keep my stuff.  We have a house.  There's plenty of room.  I think what Dexter is trying to say Is that he needs space for himself In the marriage.  Okay, yeah, But I really do need a place To put my stuff.  Of course.  Of course.  I'll  I'll give you space.  You will? Yes.  See what happens when you're honest? You get what you need.  I know you're here.  You always catch me.  Mind if I join you? Look how beautiful you are.  Mm.  I'll never get tired of hearing that.  You look better.  I feel better.  You know why? Nikki wald didn't kill lundy.  How do you know? 'cause somebody stole lundy's trinity research.  Me.  And there's only one person who'd have a reason To do that.  me? Trinity.  You're kidding.  He must have realized lundy was getting close.  Think about it.  that newspaper article.  Maybe he even saw lundy staking out that office building.  I guess.  He killed lundy, he shot me, He stole lundy's books to cover his ass.  Not exactly, but you were on a roll there For a while.  Do you know how awesome this is? It means that cocksucker is still out there, And now I don't have to sit around and wait For someone else to take care of it.  I can get him.  Great, now I have got to worry About you getting on trinity's radar.  Have you told laguerta your theory? Not yet.  I need to make sure I have a case first.  I don't want to step on my dick.  No, definitely not.  I got to get to the station.  Lots of work to do.  By the way I think I know who dad was fucking.  What? wait, who? I'll tell you when I know more.  I don't want to step on my dick with that either.  So you ready? I was born of primordial ooze.  I crawled out of my own mother's blood.  I hid among the humans, hoping not to be seen.  But somewhere along the way, I grew legs, Stood upright.  Would you give me a hand? Absolutely.  So what do you think? Is it too stuffy? Nope.  It's perfect.  Thank you.  I became a husband, A father.  I had to evolve.  It was the only way to survive.  I have something else I want to give you.  Being myself in front of my family Will take some getting used to, But Arthur was right.  It does feelgood.  Got it.  A padlock? For the door.  To keep it locked.  Shouldn't I leave it open? Please, we have three young children.  There's dangerous stuff in there.      Previous EpisodeNext Episode"

Come up here all the time.  Try to eat my dogs.  This one I was gonna eat.  He shot the animal in the head.  He started to gut him and he found the arm.  Adult female No blood flow from the ruptured blood vessels.  The bite was post mortem.  What's this? Ligature marks.  Her wrists were tied.  I'm guessing the gator didn't do that.  Well, we got a homicide, guys.  Alligator alley, A perfect spot to dump the body.  And knowing that it won't last.  I'll test for fingerprints.  Let's get a search team here.  Maybe they could find some more body parts.  A head would be nice.  Dexter, finally.  You have to help me finish my report on african animals.  No, I need him to put up the shelves in my room.

Yeah, we needed some supplies for the next build.  Let me give you a hand.  oh, thank you.  I'll help you load it up.  Oh, good.  So jonah's not around to help you this morning? No, he's got rotc in the morning, Football practice in the afternoon, And no time to help out his dad.  That's too bad.  No, no.  it's a good thing.  Is it? Kyle, you're a father.  You know we're responsible To push our children out into the world.  To make them prepared and self sufficient.  Right, yeah, of course.  Push them out.  right.  How do you do that? You have to encourage their outside interests.  Jonah's got all his activities and rebecca's got her ballet And she has college level science classes.  That sounds very busy.  Well, so busy that I hardly get to see them.  And they hardly get to see you.  Allowing you to do whatever you want.  Simple advice, but there's got to be more.  So hey, if you ever need any extra help, Just let me know.  Oh, thank you.  Really, I mean it.  Absolutely.  It's just that   Just what? Well Honestly, I'm new here and without my family, I don't know anybody.  So What are you doing tomorrow morning? Nothing.  Meet me at my house.  Okay.  Hey, Deb, great to see you.  Welcome back, detective.  Welcome back.  thanks.  Hey.  You're getting the hero's welcome, I see.  Hey, welcome back.  It's not like they haven't seen me, i've been around.  Yeah, but now you're officially back.  So glad you're okay.  Who was that? I have no fucking clue.  Take a bullet and suddenly You're everybody's best friend.  Oh, on the house.  Welcome back.  Fat Jesus on a bike, get me out of here.  Cover me, bro.  Hi, Dexter Morgan.  Of course.  we met before.  Uh, excuse me, I have to talk   Yeah, that's why I'm stopping you.  As a favor to me, I'd really like you to not write about my sister.  I think she'll make a great story.  I should interview you as well.  You can give me some background   No, Debra's recovering from a serious injury.  She needs to be left alone.  Stay away.  Why don't you, uh, get us a couple coffees.  What's with the attitude? She's just trying to do her job.  Everybody's trying to get a piece of Debra right now.  She's been through a lot.  Your sister's a big girl.  And she can take care of herself.  I don't see why this is any of your business.  Look, I know you and I have had our little differences.  You might want to keep in mind how all that started.  So what are you saying? I'm saying the guy who saw the other guy Steal the money from the crime scene Wants christine kept away.  Sorry Sorry I'm late.  Actually, that's bullshit.  I'm not late.  I was hiding at the end of the hall So I could tell you all at once and get it over with.  Um Thank you, I'm great.  No, I don't need your help, And no I'm not gonna show you the scar.  So please, can we just fucking move on? And, uh, why is there a picture Of a fucking arm up there? Well, let's all welcome back detective fuckin' Morgan.  I was just about to ask sergeant batista To update us on his case.  Based on the fingerprints, we've i. d. 'd the victim As estrella carazo   19 years old.  She is a citizen of nicaragua, Here on an expired visa.  Uh, the m. e.  estimates that the arm Was ingested less than 72 hours ago And the time of death less than 24 hours prior to that.  She worked as a cocktail waitress At the bayside club.  But she also did some modeling.  Yeah, she had a job scheduled four days ago With a photographer named Jonathan Farrow.  He's a very big fashion photographer.  That's disgusting.  what the fuck? That is sick.  Even I'm disturbed by this.  Ms.  carazo didn't report for work The night after she was scheduled to see Farrow.  The kicker is, seven years ago Farrow was arrested In new york on suspicion of rape.  The charges were ultimately dropped.  So he's clean? When I spoke with the lead detective of that case, Uh, he thinks the victim was paid off.  Okay, so he's dirty.  The guy's surrounded by a firewall of lawyers.  He's well protected and playing hardball.  Maybe i'll get a turn at bat.  Well, he's agreed to come in for questioning this morning But I doubt if we'll get anything out of him.  I'd like to be there.  okay.  Well thank you, ang   sgt.  batista.  Excuse me.  You're welcome, Lieuteant.  What's with batista and Laguerta? What are you talking about? They're afraid to look at each other.  Why would that be? Because they're doing it? Makes sense.  When you put two people in a room together long enough Eventually they're gonna fuck.  Oh, wow.  that's so romantic.  You should have that tattooed across your fat head.  What? I'll need to find the right activity for astor.  What did I like to do when I was 12? Okay, then, moving on.  Hi, this is mr.  Farrow's assistant, hold please.  Uh, no, I'm sorry.  mr.  Farrow is not available For any bookings right now.  You have nothing better to do? I wouldn't say Farrow's nothing.  Compared to Trinity, he is.  Trinity's not going anywhere.  With his kill cycle over He's not a threat to anyone for the time being.  Not sure I could say the same about this guy.  I haven't the faintest idea who estrella carazo is.  Oh, yes.  God, she had a nice ass.  I shot her in my studio last thursday For a jamaican rum campaign.  Nothing sells rum like a nice booty.  What time was that? Yeah, then I drove down to the keys For another commercial shoot That lasted well into the night.  That can be verified? By my assistant and about a dozen other people.  Tell me, Dexter, What's the real reason you're stalling On killing Trinity? I still have things to learn from him.  I spent my entire life trying to teach you Not to be like him.  You also taught me I couldn't be with people, I couldn't get married.  You taught me a lot of things I learned were wrong.  You're taking a risk here.  Isn't that what life is? A risk? Any ideas who might have wanted to harm miss carazo? Look, the girl was gorgeous but she was f. o. j. j.  F. o. j. j. ? Fresh off the jumbo jet.  yeah.  Very rural, you might say.  Sensitive guy I like you.  I could make you a star.  I just need to get you in my studio Whip your clothes off and rough you up a little bit.  I think you just jumped to the top of my list.  It's gonna be so nice To finally have my own place again.  Nice apartment.  Yeah, right? I've wanted it for years.  Who's was it? Dexter's.  No shit? How come you're just now getting it? I mean, he got married, like what, eight months ago? Well, he kind of held on to it for a while.  For what, like his secret fuckpad? No I think he just has a problem with change.  He's very slow to evolve.  Anyway, I should be going.  Yeah, thanks for the help.  I'm not suppose to lift anything for a while.  You kept your apartment after you got married? What kind of guy does that? What are you hiding, Dexter? Stay out of my life.  I know this is, like, your place now But are you always gonna, like, Have people here? Yes, dex, sometimes I'm gonna have people over.  This is, uh, the rest of your stuff from the house.  Thanks.  I'm picking up right where Lundy left off with Trinity.  I owe him that much, right? So look There are over 60 deaths linked to Trinity.  I have every little iota of evidence Frank collected Except what was stolen by Trinity.  And I'm gonna run it all by Laguerta tomorrow With the kicker That Trinity shot me and Lundy too.  Wow, that's a lot.  Fuck yeah, it's a lot.  Deb's right but it sounds like Some mad conspiracy theory.  Which is exactly what Laguerta will think When she hears it.  I'm gonna fuckin' blow her away.  Are these   They're dad's old c. i.  files.  Didn't know you had them.  So you haven't told me how it's going   Your search.  I finally got some real info On who dad might have been seeing.  My mother, you mean? I'm having coffee with her tomorrow.  Okay, now I'm confused.  Coffee? Her name's Valerie hodges.  I left a message for her, like, a month ago, And she finally called me back.  Not my mother.  Debra's headed in the wrong direction.  But when she realizes that and gets headed the right way   Laura Moser leads to brian Moser, Leads to the ice truck killer, leads to Harry Morgan.  So many little stepping stones That lay a path directly to the real me.  Let me know how it goes.  I will.  Hi, Dexter.  Hi, Dexter.  hey.  Hey, sweetie.  Hey, buddy.  Tough day? Elliot's girlfriend moved out this afternoon.  Oh, that's too bad.  What's too bad? What's too bad is That I found all this fun stuff for kids to do today And I can't do any of it 'cause I'm too big.  Like what? Well, for cody, I thought he might like to join the young sailors club.  Yeah! Wow, that's great.  Elliot's son danny's in that.  I think they have an outing this weekend? I wanna sail.  Then sail you shall.  What about me? How does soccer grab you? You get to kick things.  No, thanks.  Okay, how about ballet? Yuck.  Okay.  How about the little scientists association? Why do you hate me so much? We'll keep working on astor.  But this is a good idea.  How did you decide to do all this? Well, I feel it's my responsibility as their father To help push the kids out into the world.  Make them prepared and self sufficient.  I'm impressed.  Dinner's almost ready.  Good, i've got an early morning meeting.  Okay, two serial killers go for a ride Why do I get the feeling this joke ends With only one of them coming back? I've barely skimmed the surface Of arthur mitchell.  Still so much to learn about handling the kids.  The wife Choose your weapon.  Or maybe not.  I have plenty of experience with the chainsaw.  But it's heavy, difficult to wield, Has a short reach.  Um, axe.  This is a little too into the woods for me.  So what is it we're doing out here? We're gonna cut down a tree.  Oh.  God damn it! Want me to give it a try? Stand back.  So about the kids, Uh, one of them doesn't wanna do Any of the things I suggested.  So don't make them suggestions.  What do you mean? They're just children, kyle.  If you let them do whatever they want, They'd suck their thumbs and diddle themselves all day.  So why did we come out here Instead of just go to the hardware store? I don't want the lumber in the hardware store.  This is better   Yeah, it's better.  Okay, arthur, you're a bit off today.  Uh Kyle, I didn't mean to hit it.  Of course not.  it was an accident.  Huh, we should go.  It's gonna die.  it's suffering.  It needs to be put out of its misery, arthur.  You need to kill it.  No, i  i can't.  He spent his life killing innocent people, But he can't kill bambi? This is your new role model, dex? It's in pain, arthur.  Please, I can't.  Get that axe from him.  Kill him now.  Would you like me to kill it? Would you do that for me? Now, Dexter.  kill arthur, now.  Man, early mornings with Trinity can be murder.  Lieuteant? The judge won't issue a search warrant On Farrow's studio.  No probable cause.  Well, that's bad news.  Very, cause I'm still sure he's our guy.  I think this means he's my guy.  And this case may be bigger Than what we originally thought.  I've got the names of at least three models From central and south America Who have all gone missing over the past year.  All here illegally.  Now we know that at least one of them Worked for Farrow.  I figure he picks his victims Knowing that once they've disappeared, Their families have no way Of getting an investigation started.  And I can't get a search warrant on this come mierda.  Fortunately, unlike batista, I don't need a search warrant.  Keep working it.  find another way in.  Can I ask you something? Off the record.  Go for it.  Is it true that you and batista Are in some kind of relationship? Excuse me, detective? It's just that there's a rumor going around   Then please stop spreading it.  As a fellow woman in the largely male work force, I'd think you'd have a little more sensitivity To this kind of situation.  Sgt.  batista and I are co workers and friends.  Shit.  Farrow has a reputation for partying Late into the night.  And tonight should be no different.  Farrow's trusty assistant closing up shop.  Right on schedule.  Estrella carazo, Are those tears for real? I know you like to create images of violence, But this isn't fake blood I'm seeing.  Someone was hit right here Managed to make it this far Before she was Hit again.  And then here A fingernail.  Not exactly cinderella's glass slipper.  But it is a fit.  Valerie? that would be me.  Debra Morgan.  I figured.  Sit down.  I left you messages weeks ago.  I figured you weren't gonna call.  Well, I was on a cruise.  Rich old men love to spend money on me.  Um, so you use to work for my dad, Harry Morgan? I did.  I still have my sources, If that's what you're wondering.  Pick up where we left off.  Of course, my fee's gonna be a little higher now.  No, actually, I just wanted to ask you about my dad.  Did you and my father Did you ever have a romantic relationship? Oh, um, I'm not sure romantic is the right word.  I was one of his girlfriends, If that's what you're asking.  There were others? I think he picked the c. i. s Based on how good we were in the sack.  I'm sorry  that's just That's just not the picture I have of my dad.  Oh Hey, I knew he was a hound when I met him, We all did.  I was one of his favorites though.  I use to drive him crazy with this one thing   That's enough   that's enough.  Thank you.  Thanks.  Does this mean you're not gonna hire me? I should have listened to everybody.  It was a huge mistake to look into dad's past.  What happened? It's too much.  I don't need to know all this stuff.  What stuff? Dad was fucking Valerie hodges.  Really? But apparently she was just one of many.  It's every father's nightmare Disappointing his children.  That doesn't sound like Harry.  Thank you, dex.  I don't even know who Harry is anymore.  He's still everything you remember him to be.  Is he? We all have secrets, Deb.  Some of them shouldn't be found out.  I don't have any secrets like that.  No, me neither.  I should just leave it alone.  My mother Yeah, I think that's probably for the best.  I'm gonna turn these in and be done with it.  No, you don't have to.  i'll do it.   thanks.  You need to destroy that file, Dexter.  Close that door forever.  I can't let her be cut up again.  Hey, sweetie.  hey.  Not another gift.  No, it's not a gift.  It's a push, remember? What's that for? It's for you.  it's your new guitar.  Why? 'cause you're gonna take guitar lessons.  Says who? Me.  We'll see.  I learned a long time ago you can't force them To do things they don't wanna do.  Yeah, I guess.  So are you ready for your big weekend? What big weekend? The overnight camping trip with the young sailors.  I'm not a young sailor, cody is.  I'm a 30 something sailor.  But you have to go with him.  that's part of the deal.  They need adults with boats.  You're signed up to take four of the boys.  I didn't realize that.  I didn't know I'd have to get so involved.  This isn't a good weekend for me.  Dexter, what do you have to do That's so important? Stuff.  Stuff? stuff.  You can't cancel because of stuff.  Cody will be so disappointed.  Well, what time do we have to leave in the morning? If I can't do Farrow tomorrow, i'll do him tonight.  Everything's ready.  Where are you going? I gotta prep the boat.  If we're camping out, we'll need a tent, Sleeping bags, food, water.  I gotta get two children's life vests.  Abduct Jonathan Farrow take him back to his studio, Kill him, cut him to pieces, dump him in the ocean.  Honestly, rita, this is gonna take me a while.  Do you need some help? No, I got it.  This really means a lot to cody.  Me too.  And suddenly Tonight's the night.  Jonathan Farrow, party animal.  Okay, Jonathan, party like there's no tomorrow.  I'm on mr.  Farrow's list.  I don't have all night.  Neither does Jonathan Farrow.  Excuse me, could you tell mr.  Farrow I just saw a homeless guy throwing up In the back seat of his car? Quinn? What is he doing here? It couldn't be coincidence.  This whole thing just became too risky.  Can you believe he's here? Uh, who is he? That's quinn.  I've never heard of him.  You'd be making a big mistake.  Hello.  Hello yourself.  You must be quinn? I am.  This lab geek just fucking ditch me? Okay, tonight's not the night.  Guess I'm prepping the boat to go camping after all.  The biscayne bay, boys! Home of the seminole indians, the spanish conquistadors, Cutthroat pirates And now Dexter Morgan and four skinny boys.  Harry used to take me camping.  If I can't kill Jonathan Farrow tonight, At least I can make the most of my time with cody.  See, you just pull it tight, like that, And that's your bowline.  That's my personal favorite.  You might prefer a taut line hitch, though.  I'll show you on the other side.  Or maybe you wanna see a trucker's hitch That's a fun one.  Dexter? What? Can I throw dirt clods? Oh, okay.  You forgot the rope.  Right You seem a little distracted.  Yeah, well, arthur's technique Of keeping the kids busy and therefore keeping me free Isn't working out like it was supposed to.  So maybe it's time to kill him.  After Farrow.  Hey.  I just got the official go ahead from Laguerta To open a Trinity killer investigation.  Really? She went for the whole Serial killer thing? Okay, let's call it a limited Trinity investigation.  What's that mean? Right before I went in, I realized if I pitched the entire Trinity theory And I added that he also shot me and Lundy, I'd look like a fucking lunatic.  So I boiled it down to the bare essentials.  Which are? The bludgeonings.  They still go back 30 years.  So I can investigate Trinity Without Laguerta knowing I'm investigating Trinity.  Smart.  What's the next step? I don't know.  I don't know, but what I do know Is that Trinity killed Frank.  And I'm gonna catch him.  I'm sure you will.  So sarge.  What's this about you and Laguerta? A little bump and grind? Do not talk about Lieuteant Laguerta that way.  Comprende? Wow, I'm sorry.  You must really dig her.  Angel.  Quinn just asked me If you and I were bumping and grinding.  Debra Morgan asked me the same thing.  Well, not in those words.  Where are they getting this from? I don't know.  It's you.  The way you keep looking at me.  Everywhere I go you're staring at my culo.  Okay, that is so not true.  It is too.  Now I know That I have a pretty nice ass, But you gotta stop.  I miss you, angel.  I miss you too.  But we made our choice.  Yeah, yeah.  When all of a sudden They heard a scratching noise on the roof of the car.  What was that? And they thought, \"let's get out of here. \" So they drove home as fast as they could.  And when they got home, He went around to open the car door For his girlfriend And there hanging from the handle, A bloody hook! That doesn't even make sense.  Your turn, Dexter.  Uh, actually, I don't know any scary stories.  Oh, come on.  give it a shot.  All right.  There's a man.  You can call him the man of three.  You can call him Trinity.  You can call him anything you want But the fact is he's not a man at all.  He's a monster.  He was born in a bathtub filled with blood.  For countless years he's roamed the countryside Killing the innocent, leaving behind Bits of his dead sister.  Sometimes he'll sneak up on a man And raise his hammer overhead, And then he'll swing it down   And smash his own thumb and then go crying all the way home, Like a little baby.  That's what happens.  That was funny.  thanks And now I think it's time to hit the sleeping bags.  You guys are beat.  you've had a huge day.  Hey, buddy.  You need anything? I'm good.  Do you need anything? No, I'm good too.  The kids won't wake up till it's light out.  Plenty of time for me.  What the hell is going on   what is this? This Is the decisive moment.  What's the name of the photographer Who always talked about that? Cartier bresson.  right  right.  Once you miss it it's gone forever.  A perfect moment Frozen in time.  Something like that, right? Yes, but   Ow, fuck, fuck, fuck! Who are you? I'm the person who's going to to keep you From killing any more women.  What? I've never killed anyone.  You killed Estrella Carazo.  Who knows how many others I didn't fucking kill them! I photographed them! It's too fucking bad they're dead but i   Too fucking bad they're dead.  Life is hard, and it's brutal and ugly, And way too fucking short.  That's why I shoot what I do, beautiful women.  Who are bruised and cut and bleeding.  Oh, fuck It's for the contrast! You add a little bit of the real world It makes them all the more beautiful.  Until you kill them.  If they could thank me, they fucking would.  Because of my pictures, Those women will live on forever! Nothing lasts forever.  Man has always been drawn to the sea.  But it's an unnatural setting for us.  A place of great danger.  Tides, currents, waves, wind Each presenting their own hazards.  None of which can be ignored.  The slightest lapse of judgment Can be a mistake you might never recover from.  But a good sailor doesn't fight Against these elements.  A good sailor works with them, Using them to his advantage.  While others less fortunate might be forever cast adrift, Often in several pieces.  He always comes home safely.  What the hell? Isn't that   Farrow's assistant.  I just arrested him for the murder Of estrella carazo.  But, no, I thought   Yeah, at first it looked like Farrow, But this is airtight.  We got camera footage from the tollbooth Of him heading over to alligator alley.  We got dna evidence.  we got everything.  I killed an innocent man.      Previous EpisodeNext Episode"

He moved the arm For a reason.    that smudge you found at the crime scene   Cremated human remains.    we got the killer's goddamn dna?   the killer is related to the human remains   Same family, the same dna.    he keeps his family with him all the time.  Vera mitchell, sister of arthur mitchell Found dead in a bathtub.  This is arthur mitchell at his core.  Is there something in his dna That lets him keep a family   some magic gene i'm missing?   i just got the official go ahead from laguerta To open a trinity killer investigation.    what's that mean?   i realized if i pitched the entire trinity theory And i added that he also shot me and lundy, Look like a fucking lunatic, so i boiled it down To the bludgeonings.    i am no longer seeing lieutenant laguerta.    we broke up, officially.    if i find out this is bullshit, There will be consequences   Severe, career ending consequences.    who are you?   i'm the person who's going to keep you From killing any more women.    i didn't fucking kill them! Because of my pictures, Those women will live on forever!   nothing lasts forever.    [screams]   isn't that     farrow's assistant.  I just arrested him for the murder of estrella carazo.    but, no, i thought     yeah, at first it looked like farrow, but this is airtight.  We got dna evidence.  we got everything.    i killed an innocent man.  So i made a mistake.  It could've happened to anyone   Well, any murderer   Not that murderers typically care Whether their victims are innocent or not.  Then why is it eating at me? Jonathan farrow   \"s\" and \"m\" photographer, Abuser of women, asshole, but not a killer, Not up to harry's code.  Yet i killed him.  Now i'm Uncomfortable.  It should've been arthur mitchell on my table [sighs] trinity, shooter of my sister.  I should've No, no \"should'ves. \" i don't do \"should'ves. \" That's not me.    [whispers] this isn't me.  [glass breaks] aah, shit.    i just need to stop thinking about it.    jonathon farrow Originally a suspect, now possibly a victim.    it was a mistake, for fuck's sake.    farrow disappeared right before his assistant, Timothy brand, confessed to murdering those models.  Missing persons has been investigating, And now they're passing it on to us.    you think brand killed farrow?   maybe he found out what brand was up to, it's hard to say.  Soderquist, yale, stay with farrow.    brand probably turned him into gator bait.    i wish i could take comfort That my crime has been pinned on brand.  But i can't.    what is wrong with you?   [sighing] i don't know.    okay, moving on.  morgan What do we have on your bludgeonings?   maybe this'll cheer you up.    not if you're making headway on trinity.    we've got a serial bludgeoner.  The victims are all men in their 40s.  I've got cases dating back 30 years, Which most likely puts our bludgeoner in his 50s or 60s.  The break in the case came with the discovery Of the human ash he left behind, Along with his own saliva   Read dna.    you're welcome.  just doing my job.    the killer leaves the ash as his sick ass signature, Making his vics point at it post mortem.  I can't be sure all of these are ash marks, But the finger pointing indicates A strong possibility that   ahh, how'd that get in there?   no  whoa.  could you go back? Go back.  This isn't a bludgeoning.    no.    yet the victim's finger seems to be pointing towards a smudge.  Ash?   don't do it, deb.    uh Yeah, probably.    when you presented this case to me, You said it was limited to a bludgeoner.  So how about we hear all of it, detective morgan?   it's gonna sound insane I hope.    all right, i found possible smudges In several old bathtub killings Also several jumper suicides.  And that's the pattern   Bathtub, jumper, bludgeon   All in close succession One cycle of three vics every year or so, Possibly for 30 years   Different cities, different states.  It's a trinity of victims Which is why frank lundy called him the \"trinity killer. \"   this is an fbi case?   the fbi never bought it.    yet we're supposed to.    lundy came to miami to hunt this guy.  I think he got too close, And i think it got him killed and me shot.    so this trinity killer did that to you?   come on, laguerta, say it's far fetched.    go on.    great, like i need you people getting in my way.  Well, trinity is past his due date.  This just confirms it.    dex.  Can you believe it?   yeah, you really did it.    i kept lundy's legacy alive.  I even got the bosses on board.    detective morgan, my office.  Is that a commendation i smell?   go get 'em, tiger Ess   Tigress.    dex.  hey, buddy.    keep walking.  not in the mood.    halftime?   it's called lunch, buddy.    off campus, as usual.  [elevator bell dings]   i really do need to stab something.  [building ominous music] ? ? The trinity killer This is good.  There's no question of his guilt, And i could use some certainty.    hey, jonah, how those wheels holding up?   like a dream, mr.  butler.  Like a real nice dream.    kyle! Hey.  what brings you here this fine day?   ah, just checking in.  You know, after the Deer.  Want to make sure you're okay.    oh, that's kind of you, but i've put it out of my mind, No need to dwell.    you can just do that?   no, no, no, smooth, circular motion, son, And the paint job will last for years.    got it, dad.    if you've got it, i wouldn't have to remind you.  There are two ways to things.  why not choose the right way?   small cracks in the perfect family, Which makes them perfectly normal.  [door opens]   kyle, hello.    hey.    honey, your clothes are clean, folded, and ready to be packed.    going out of town?   yeah, tampa.    oh.    a four walls build.    an out of town build   Is his cycle starting over again already?   rebecca.    mm hmm?   the ground needs to be really soaked.  A good soaking, or all these flowers are just gonna die.    sorry, dad.    so tampa   the whole family going?   no, not on out of towners.  It's too expensive to put 'em all up.    oh, admit it, arthur.  You enjoy those vacations from us.  He always comes home so relaxed.    i'm sure.  You leaving today?   no, tomorrow, right from work.    there's the \"where\" and the \"when. \" An out of town kill   trinity's own m. o. , How poetic.    well, happy travels.    take care, kyle.    now i need to come up with my own \"where\" and \"when\" To convince my boss and my wife to let me leave.  All i need is some convention That smells a little like blood spatter   Something science y.  Brake and muffler exhibit  no.  Knitting and needlepoint convention   No blood there unless someone impales themselves.  A trade show convention.  Oh, a convention on conventions.    remember me?   debra morgan, sister.    debra morgan, former detective on the trinity case.    former?   fucking laguerta took me off the case, 'cause officially i'm a victim of this cocksucker's crimes.    that's too bad.    too bad? [chuckles] it fucking sucks.    well, the bright side is this frees you up To help the department in so many ways.    in the course of one day, I go from bringing in the biggest case Miami metro has ever seen To being \"freed up in so many ways\"?   [sighs]   i love you, bro, but sometimes you're a fucking tard.    yeah, i know.  [computer beeps]   tampa   what the hell's in tampa?   something science y.  A crime scene is basically a micro climate Subject to so many variables.  In the world of blood spatter, Those variables can mean the difference Between good science and the guilty going free.  Everything from the anomalous effects of barometric pressure On particulate liquids in a high humidity environment To the ionization of     point, please.    oh.  Meteorological conference, tampa.    if i let you go, will you stop talking?   you see, learning even more about hemoglobin dispersion And the magnetic effects of lightning In the case of severe thunderstorms Could prove invaluable, Because it can all be considered causal In the determination of bloodstain analysis.    oh Is that it?   that's all i could come up with.    well, i it sounds like you're very excited About this conference.    not to mention how it will look When my salary revue comes up.  We could start paying for your college.    i love your dedication To work, to this family.  It's one of the reasons why i married you.    one of the many, right?   right.  [harrison coos] You know, and, actually, Elliot's taking the kids fishing, So they'll be busy at least one of those days.    he's a good neighbor, that elliot.    but i do need some space too, So i'll trade you.  I'll cover the kids this weekend, And you cover them tuesday nights when i go to yoga?   yoga?   it's the new me.    well, i like the new you.    though scheduling my activities Around her downward facing dog could prove challenging I'll dwell on that later.  [salsa music] ? ? What does one pack for an out of town kill? Got to travel light.  can't raise suspicion.  I just need a reliable tool, Something i can count on.  [blade sings]   hey!   oh, you startled me.    sorry.  I was hoping to catch a ride to tampa.    kyle     i need to get away, even just for the weekend.    um, i'm sorry.  [engine turning] There'll be other opportunities, but not this one.    i can't wait.  arthur, i need to do this.  Give something back to the world.  Make things right.  I can't do that without your help.  I have to get out of here Out of here Away from this Feeling, whatever it is.  And with you, i feel focused, Like i have a sense of purpose and certainty.  I need you.    i I have nothing to give you.    generosity of spirit, arthur? I know those are more than just words to you.  Tell me they're not just Words.    you need my help?   more than you know.    there's nobody else?   you're the one, arthur The only one.    well, come on.    i knew i could count on you.    according to dexter's spatter work, Our suspect is at least six feet tall.    [quietly] closer to 6'4\".    more like 6'4\".  The dna profile says we're looking For a caucasian male of northern european descent, Blue eyes   50 to 70 years old.    so we're looking for a potentially retired, Old, white guy.  In miami?   great.  And this is the snowbird season.    which quadruples our old white guy quotient.    there's got to be something else we can do, Some other angle     uh, dna sweep.  We could do a targeted dna sweep Of white males, 60 ish, in the miami metro area.    you know how much work that is? I've got a big weekend planned.  as in twins.    you got twins lined up?   not yet, but that's the plan.  Besides, the aclu will shut this down The minute word gets out.    and they always do.  You can't do a roadblock without drawing some attention.    uh, it's the weekend.  Um Next week's thanksgiving, So, uh, the courts will be closed.    sweeps have worked in miami before.    right, the south beach rapist, The robbery homicide case in '06.    '07.    '07.    wait, wait, who's gonna   who's gonna pay for all this? The department's so strapped, We can't even afford coffee filters.  I used toilet paper to make the coffee this morning.    if dna is our only lead, then dna is what we'll look for.  Let me worry about the budget.  Masuka, write up a protocol for random field swabbing That patrol can follow.  Everything goes through you.    there go my plans.    happy?   how are we gonna pay for this?   i have no idea.  But i'm about to spend a lot of hours Looking for loose change in the budget.    that's a lot of work.  Want some help?   absolutely.  come on in.    okay.    you know The briefing room might be better.    out  out in the open?   mm hmm.    yeah? Better?   i already feel the cloud of farrow lifting In anticipation of tonight.    so what time do we get started in the morning?   6:00.    it'll be mostly local guys?   yeah, women too.    the first kill in his cycle of three is always a woman, But he won't get the chance.    do we all stay at the same hotel?   i don't know.    is it close to the build?   it's walking distance.    does everybody hang out     good lord, you have a lot of questions.    sorry.    you told me you were troubled.  About what?   i did something.  [sighs]   well, let's hear it.    i made a mistake.    we all make mistakes.    it was a big one.    you're being purposely vague, kyle, Like one of my tenth graders Who's trying to explain why he didn't do his homework.    i have a feeling i'm gonna Make some tenth graders very happy.    pit stop.    you're a brave man, kyle.    how so?   eating from a vending machine.    years of training   iron stomach.    maybe you could show some of that same bravery By sharing what's bothering you.    [breathes deeply]   how am i supposed to help you When i don't know what the problem is?   it's not that important.    it's important to me.    why?   because helping someone is a good deed, And god rewards good deeds, But in order to help, i need to know the problem.  That's how these things work.    i really don't want to talk about it.    you asked me, remember? that's why i brought you.    why don't we just     tell me, kyle! I'm gonna get into my van And just leave you here to fend for yourse     i killed a man.    you killed someone?   you of all people act appalled.    by mistake.    how? what happened?   i thought he was the right   [sighs] I thought he was an animal.    you  you were hunting?   yes, it was a hunting accident.  I was so sure.  i'm always so careful.    then it truly was an accident.    still, it's left me with this Feeling.    there are few things harder to bear than remorse.    remorse?   guilt.  remorse.  It's what separates us from the animals.  Your conscience is eating away at you.  But you're gonna feel better.  Confession is good for the soul.    all the more proof i have no soul.  Doing good deeds, scoring points with god.  You and i are way beyond the point system, arthur.  The best deed i can do is rid the world of you.  A fitting kill room Small, but i'll be cutting him down to size.  I just need to pick up a few supplies.  [cell phone rings]   hey, deb.    how's the weather?   funny.    you talking climate with a bunch of dorks and nerds, You really lead the life.    is there a reason for this call? It's getting late.    that jumper out at the warehouse, You took a bunch of crime scene photos.  Did you put them all in the file?   i take a lot of photos.  i don't use 'em all.    but you save them?   i do.    i want to look through 'em, See if i can find any ash smudges.    well, they're all on the lab computer.  Masuka can access 'em for you.    i can't ask masuka.    why?   because i'm not working this case.    could've fooled me.    i know, right? At least i got quinn to start dna sweeps tomorrow.  That's something anyway, right?   dna sweeps?   yeah, we're gonna do random cheek swabs On tall white men over 50, preferably with blue eyes.    good luck with that.    thanks.  Hey, you run into that weather guy, sonny skyes, You tell him he's got a stupid name.    will do.    but first a little shopping.    oh.  [chuckles] Are you headed out?   yeah, for ice.    change of plan for tomorrow.  We're not going to the build.  I got a surprise for you instead.    uh I don't like surprises.    you'll like this one.  it'll make you feel better.    how will it make me feel better? Could he have some kind of formula For remorse or something? If anyone does, it'd be him.  It's not like i can't kill him tomorrow night.    good.  so far we've saved   $24,000.    not bad.    mm, it's not enough.  We need at least $12,000 more.  What?   your hair.  My heart skips a beat     stop it.  And thank you.  what time is it? dios mio.    it's late.  We're the last ones here.  [acoustic guitar music] ? ? [door opens]   yo.    you're still here.    me and a bunch of guys were at the bar.  I came back with some good news.  They want to donate a vacation day to help pay For this dna sweep thing.    that's amazing, bro.    fucker shot one of our own.    look at this.  all those days.    it's enough.  it fills the gap.  ? ?   [sighs] ? ?   fuck it.  ay, papi [knock at door]   who the fuck is it?   it's me.  I called, but you didn't pick up.  [sighs] i know it's late, but i've had the worst day.    i'm sorry, babe, but i i   i could lose my job.  Not like i'm the only one, Being a journalist these days Is a straight ticket to the unemployment line.    you're not gonna lose your job.    my editor laid it out.  He said either i get \"a lead that bleeds,\" Or basically i'm done.    so you're here.    what?   look, christy, i'm half asleep and half in the bag.  I can't give you anything.    how about a little support? You know, like a hug? Or an \"everything's gonna be all right\"?   everything's gonna be all right.    that's bullshit.    hey, come here.  It is gonna be all right, 'cause you're a kick ass reporter, And i'm gonna help you dig something up, Just not in homicide.  Maybe you should stay.    not if you're on the fence.  I'll see you tomorrow.    quick cab to the meteorological conference.  Check in, establish an alibi.  I'll be back in time to     kyle! Hey.  You're an early bird too, huh?   yeah, how else would i catch the worm?   yeah, i'm so excited about today's surprise, I practically sprang out of bed.  [laughs] You ready for this?   so ready.    [laughs] that's the spirit.  Come on.    yesterday he's jumping down my throat, Today he's the happy dancing man.  Is that mask of his crumbling? [engine turning]   oh, frank.  So i was thinking It might not be a bad idea to ask masuka     oh, fuck me.  Don't you have other cases you should be working on?   i'm trying to help you.  Maybe you should ask masuka if you could get Dexter's old discard photos From the tarla grant crime scene.  You know, tarla grant, the supposed jumper?   yeah, i know who tarla grant is.  Why do i care about your brother's snaps?   well, because if she's one of trinity's victims, You might find an ash smudge.    so basically i'm your tool.  that it?   yeah.  that's it.  I'm using you to make you look good, But i wouldn't want you to feel like a tool.    make sure each kit gets a chain of custody sticker.    these swab things gonna take a long time to turn around?   well, in the real world, yes, but since i'm organizing it, We've got mad mojo, top of the pile action going on.  Come on, people, the faster we get 'em out in the field, The faster we get 'em back here digesting.    you got access to dexter's discard crime scene photos?   we share everything Not in a gay way.    yeah, that jumper, tarla grant   Maybe he accidentally snapped a smudge or something.    good idea, especially from you And one more thing i have to handle While he's at his conference.    you guys and your fucking geek fests.    i'll have you know, I've almost banged so much tail at those \"geek fests. \"   sure.  you.  but poindexter?   dexter is pure jungle cat.  You should've seen the hot english muffin He was \"bow chicka wowing\" a couple years ago While he was dating rita.    huh.    lila was insane Literally.  I could tell you stories.    really?   mom! look, i caught one!   wow! that's a monster.    yeah, and astor caught the biggest fish of the day.  Come on, show your mom.    impressive.    no biggie, just lucky.    can we eat him?   absolutely, but we have to wait till dexter comes home.  He's the fish gutter around here.    i clean a pretty decent fish.    oh, no, it's all right.  you don't have to.    no, please, my pleasure.  How about i clean 'em, you cook 'em, And we all eat 'em together?   yeah!   all right.  i do make a mean mango salsa.    all right.  kids, fishies, to the sink.    what are we doing here?   trying to help you.  [doorbell ringing] Hello, my name is arthur mitchell.  This is my friend kyle butler.    no, thank you.    i'm not trying to sell anything.  You see, i grew up in this house many years ago.  I was hoping to take a look.  We'll just take a minute.  we'll be out before you know it.  [both speaking korean]   upstairs.    you have a lovely home.  [both speak korean]   a bathroom?   this is where it all started.    what started here?   i was standing here Watching my sister take a shower.    you were watching your sister?   i was ten.  It was innocent.  But vera saw me In the mirror.  I startled her, and she slipped Shattered the shower doors.  The glass Sliced her leg.  She was dead by the time the ambulance came.  So much blood.    born in blood, both of us.    my parents blamed me.  My mother became a shell, a ghost.  She eventually killed herself.    jumped to her death.    left me all alone With him.  He was always a drinker But without mother, it became worse.  So did the beatings.  \"little fucking pervert, Fucking cunt, you killed them. \"   what happened to him?   he died.    no, you killed your father.  I'm betting hammer.    i never told anyone Any of this.    why did you tell me?   so you'd know you're not alone.  You're just like me.  We're both responsible for the death of an innocent.  We share that.  You feel better?   you have to go now! Leave!   i call the police!   don't be absurd.    uh why don't we grab some lunch? I heard about a great place back in tampa.    yeah.  lunch does sound good.    sorry.    little coffee with that sugar?   can't beat the combo   caffeine and sugar rush.  Quinn's out on a warrant check.    actually, i'm here to see you.    i don't know nothing about nothing.    not even about the dna roadblocks Popping up all over the city?   quinn's been fucking with you And not in that heavy breathing kind of way.    yeah, if i got it from him, would i be asking you? Are the sweeps connected to the shootings of agent lundy and     we're just dragging for drunk drivers.  We toss up roadblocks all the time around the holidays.    yeah, patrol Not homicide.  Why the dna testing?   uh, lieutenant's idea.  got a lot of open cases.  She's trying to up her solve rate.  Really no story here.    yeah, well, it's all i got.  My editor's breathing down my neck, so   well, you'll embarrass yourself.    [chuckles]   look, i know it's really tough for reporters right now.  And as girls we've got to double prove ourselves.  So maybe instead of this one, I can give you that interview you've been wanting from me.    are you serious?   as long as you make me look good.  Call me.  we'll set up a time.    yeah.    uh, two.    this is the great place you heard about   A hotel coffee shop?   well, it says their tuna melts are \"taste tastic. \" I'm gonna go to the men's room.  Would you order me a     a tuna melt?   yeah.  Uh, dexter morgan.  sorry i'm late.  Thank you.    hey, sonny skyes.  love you, man.    hey, sonny skyes?   that would be me.  hi.    do you mind? my wife is a huge fan.    sure.    oops.  here we go.

Come kiss mr.  fish head.  kiss mr.  fish lips now.    that's disgusting!   don't leave mr.  fish     [screams]   kyle! over here! Hey, where you been?   sorry, there was a line.    no, no, gave me a chance to say hello to the neighbors.  Kyle butler, this is, uh, bob and sally moore of sarasota, Their beautiful daughter hanna, and their son, uh Spencer!   hi.    sit, sit.  There's plenty of room, right, bob?   i guess.    i've been telling them about our  our morning.    what about our morning?   you know, how we visited my childhood home.  I showed you the bathroom where my sister died.    kids don't need to hear any more about that     bob, they should learn to speak the truth.    i think they know how to speak the truth.    we all need to confess our mistakes, So we can go into the light unburdened.  That's what kyle taught me yesterday.    [sighs]   not on purpose.    it was such a revelation to me When he told me what he did.  Huh?   we're leaving.    what about your tuna melt?   these folks want to enjoy their family time alone.  Let's go.    that was rather rude.    yeah, sorry.  i'm just not as open as you are.    it's the remorse.  you need to shed it.    believe me, i'm trying, But there's only one thing that'll do it.    what's that?   giving.  Is it okay if we stop by a hardware store? I want to pick up some things to donate To the four walls build tomorrow.    that's an excellent idea.  [door opens]   [humming] Morgan.    lieutenant.    what are you doing?   nothing.  Why were you singing?   i wasn't singing.  i was humming.  People have been known to hum.    not without reason.  You happy about something?   are you hiding something?   are you?   [humming]   oh Dissolving stitches my ass.  Fuck me.  Mother shit fuck.  How tall was my shooter? These wounds have a trajectory that's totally fucking straight.  Jesus, masuka, they're just tits.    but they're yours   perky, perfect.    grow the fuck up and tell me how tall my shooter is.    uh, if it was the trinity killer, Then he's about 6'4\".    up.  That puts you at about his height.  So if you're trinity, How exactly do you shoot me and get wounds like this?   casings and gsr from your shirt put you about About five feet away.  So i'm 6'4\", And the vast majority of shooters Hold their guns like this.  Unless he's trying not to attract attention.  Then like this.  Either way, To hit you on the side from up here, I got to shoot you with a downward trajectory   there's nothing downward about this.  it's completely level.    unless i'm kneeling.  But then again, i'm, like, 60, and i got to be mobile.    plus lundy would've reacted To some old guy kneeling behind me.  I remember his face exactly.    so i'm not kneeling.    then how tall is he?   my height, approximately.    oh, fucking fuck.  Then it wasn't trinity.    nope.    then who the fuck shot me?   nothing like the spirit of charity To make the heart right.    about time i gave back.    it's a good call with the plastic sheeting, by the way.  This is florida.  you never know when it's gonna rain.    [yawns] ah, compadre, i don't know about you, but i'm bushed.    we're kindred spirits, you and i.  Keep doing good work.    oh, i will.    just go to sleep No more surprises.  [door closes] [muffled tv noise]   good enough.    you know what's great?   your mango salsa?   [laughs] Wine.  Nine months without it sucked.  [both laugh]   you want to polish this off?   no, i'm   I'm already pretty buzzed.    oh, lightweight.    yeah.  If you'd said that 15 years ago, nobody would've believed you.    oh, so you weren't always a soccer mom?   mm, are you kidding? I was a dress over the head party girl.  Oh, god, did i just say that?   [laughs]   you must think i'm     totally charming.    i, um  i better start cleaning up.    yeah, let me   let me help you.    no, no.  it's getting late.  I'm sure you want to get home.    right.  i'll, uh, get the kids.  [percussive working music] ? ?   where the fuck did you go?   he's on foot With his tools.  The four walls build   A little early, but walking distance.  Empty, no security.  Just me, arthur, and a little m 99.  No more confessions, no more good deeds, And no more fucking remorse.  What are you doing? No, you're mine.  [vial shatters]   [grunting]   this isn't how you die.    let go!   why keep him alive just to kill him? But as long as it's by my hand   gotcha! gotcha!   hold on.  Give me your hand.    [grunting]   this is his solution to remorse  suicide.  That's why he could unburden himself.  He knew this was next.  Will it be my only solution someday?   i thought god sent you so that i could save you.  But god had another plan.    so did i.    he sent you to save me.    not exactly.    you're a hero.    thank you.  [people chattering]   so much for anonymity.  Arthur mitchell, you just got a reprieve.    so the trinity killer didn't shoot you and lundy.    nope.    someone masuka's size shot you.    yep.    and that's all we got to go on lundy's case?   that's it.    well, the upside is there's no longer A conflict of interest for you in the trinity case.    you mean i can work it again?   thank christ, no more backseat driving.    nobody knows this case better than you.  You're taking lead.    motherfucker, really? Well, what about lundy's case?   that's my case now.  Don't worry, i'm gonna find the shithead that shot you.    oh, oh, whoa   oh, are you okay?   i'm f  i'm fine.    you okay?   [laughs]   well, we're done here.    we're done.    morgan, update the squad at 3:00, please.    glad that didn't happen last night.    any regrets?   that we didn't have breakfast together.    at least i'll get trinity Promise.    i've killed an innocent man, and i've saved a guilty one.  I won't make that mistake again.  Is that the purpose of remorse, To keep you from repeating mistakes?   you're watching me.    i'm just concerned.    no need.  i was confused before.    but you're not anymore.    no.  embarrassed, perhaps.  In fact, i'd appreciate it If you'd think of this weekend's events as a A little accident.    you stepped off a roof.    it was a mistake.  We all make them.  Don't worry.  Your accident will never be spoken of by me.  To err is human.  Little early for a drunk driving checkpoint.    looks like one of debra's dna sweeps.    stand over here, sir, please.    you, sir, pull over here.    step on out of the car, sir, please.    yeah, i heard about this on the radio.  The police are looking for some huge serial killer.  They have his dna.  they're looking for a match.    sounds scary.    exactly how much do you want to live, arthur?   i think this gentleman in the red car has the right idea.  This line is endless.  What say we take the scenic route?   yeah, sure, arthur.    a changed man at peace with himself.  Maybe only monsters feel no regret.  If erring is human, then remorse must be too.  Wait, does that make me human? Huh.      Previous EpisodeNext Episode"

Are the sweeps connected to the shootings of agent lundy?   i know it's really tough for reporters right now.  So maybe instead of this one, i can give you That interview you've been wanting from me.  Mother shit fuck.  How tall was my shooter?   my height.    then it wasn't trinity.    nope.    i was a dress over the head party girl.  You must think i'm     totally charming.    we broke up officially.    if i find out this is bullshit, There will be severe, career ending consequences.    fuck it.    no more confessions, no more good deeds, And no more fucking remorse.  No, you're mine.  Arthur mitchell, you just got a reprieve.    this'll do the job.  Cut you into exactly the right size pieces.  You got one more day.  [laughter] Happy families are all alike.  They never leave you by yourself on holidays.    so i got some interesting thanksgiving greetings From your coach davis.  Well, if you're not gonna play baseball anymore, I suppose you aren't gonna need this.    no, dad     all right? How about this? Oh, you're full of awards.    once the turkey's gone, so is arthur.    how about this one? This one's for most valuable player.  [car door closes and engine turns]   fuck you, dad.  [engine revs and tires screech]   family business.    it's my business too.    [grunting]   okay.  Healthy way to blow off steam.    [grunts]   what the hell? Jonah? Hey, it's just me.    mr.  butler, what are you doing here?   i stopped by your house.  I saw you arguing with your father.    no, i don't argue.  i never argue.    still looked like a bad one.    man, you have no idea what he's like.  How he treats my mother and rebecca.  You don't know what he's capable of.    well, actually     he hits me.    that's not right.    you know, i'm running out of cliches to tell the coaches.  You know, \"hey, i fell down some stairs.  I walked into a door. \" I know it looks like we have the perfect fucking family, But in that house, when he's there, It's not a life.  It's a tour of duty.  Shit.  He'd kill me if he knew i was telling you this stuff.    i won't say a word.    you should have just let him die.    where you going?   anywhere away from here.  I can't go back.  Not to him.  not with the car like this.    so i'll go with you.  I'll be there when you tell him.    why?   you're not the only one with father issues.    well, you know, maybe I mean, i guess if you came to thanksgiving tomorrow, Dad would be on his best.    thanksgiving?   dinner's at 1:00.  I can stay at luke's house until then.    guess i'm having two turkey dinners this year.  The dna sweep didn't give them trinity.  But it did bring in a cornucopia of criminals.  That should keep miami metro off the trinity case Through the holiday.  Deb won't be anywhere near as easy.    i'm sorry, dex, but i'm spending thanksgiving With 90 or so of my newest friends.  Look at these victims.  It looks like a family portrait.  The bathtub women, they're always young and single.  A first girlfriend maybe.  And then the jumper's always a mother of two.  Maybe that represents his mom or his wife, But i don't think this guy's married.  And the bludgeon ee's always a father.    you used to love thanksgiving when we were kids.  You wore the little indian headdresses.  Picked the pearl onions out of the green beans.    yeah, mom's green beans.  And then she died.  And it was you and me and dad and football And tv dinners in aluminum trays.  Talk about your lonely.    well, you won't be lonely at our house.  You'll never get the chance.    dexter, i am lead detective On the biggest case of my career.  This is where i belong.    i thought batista was lead.    he's the lead on lundy now.  Once we figured out trinity didn't shoot me, There was no conflict for me     what? Wait.  Trinity didn't shoot you?   while you were at your rain man convention, Masuka and i put it together form the bullet's trajectory.    how did i not see that?   we were too close.  That's what happens when you make it personal.    [sighs] So i've heard.  So who shot you?   maybe trinity knows.  I'll ask him when i haul his ass in here.    deb, you really, really need to come to thanksgiving.    tell the family i said, \"hi. \"   all right, heads up, everybody.  This dna sweep has been like christmas.  We got hits on three open rape cases And one open burglary case.  But best of all, hits on two homicides.  Merry thanksgiving, soderquist.  And this one is mine.  Keep up the good work, guys.    sarge, any news on any other cases?   we'll find the fucker who shot you.  You know that.  Focus on what you can control.    catching trinity.    catching trinity.  [knocks on door] I heard the aclu's filing suit on the sweeps.    we've got maybe 72 hours till we're shut down for good.  We'll just have to keep pushing harder.    well, the holidays may slow us down.  We'll have a skeleton crew.    i'll be here.  Never been much for family holidays anyway.    particularly when they're all still in cuba.    particularly.  You with auri tomorrow?   she's with her moms this year.  Plus i have a chance to close an old case of mine, so   so i guess we'll both be working thanksgiving.    together.    how unfortunate.    put it up higher, mom.    no, i want it lower.    are happy families all alike?   much better.    dexter's home.    oh, good.  They didn't run out of pies.    here you go.    [giggles]   okay, bird, confess.  How big are you?   22 pounds.    that's a lot of bird.    better too much than not enough.  I mean, that's what the holiday's about.  That and family.    about tomorrow   uh oh.    it's not a big deal.  But the monroe county p. d.  needs a spatter interpretation On a bar fight and their blood guy's in the bahamas.    [sighs]   should just take a few hours.    does it have to be tomorrow?   well, that's when the reconstruction is.    mm.    plus i'll be making triple overtime.    sure, that's a plus, But you'll be missing all the fun.    yeah.    poor you.  poor us.  At least elliot will be here.    yeah, good old elliot.    so is deb coming?   she's on the fence.  [sighs]   no, tell her that this is our first family thanksgiving And that we're establishing traditions That will shape our kids and that they'll pass on To their kids and that she's a part of that.  An important part of that.  [grunts] [sighs]   rather than me tell her all that Okay, guys, now look real sad.  I mean, really miserable.  And Action.  [cell phone beeps]   hi, aunt deb.  We just heard that you might not come To thanksgiving dinner, and well     we really want you to come.    look sad, retard.    all right, all right.  Just take two.    will you please come over?   fuck me.  [sighs] You're here late.    ah, didn't even notice.    big plans tomorrow?   [chuckles] you're looking at them.  Whatever about tomorrow, right? It's just another day where people eat turkey.  I can eat turkey any day of the year.    dexter's having people over.  Well, me.  he invited me over.    have a good time.    you know [sighs] I could use a wingman.    yes.    i can't promise it'll be any fun.    well, i could be your thigh man.  [chuckles]   don't press your luck.  I'll let rita know.    [exhales] What time do you want to eat tomorrow?   oh, bad news, babe.  i got to work.    oh.  Well, what time do you get off?   uh   you do want to spend the holiday together, don't you?   it's a holiday.    [chuckles] exactly.    spending it together makes things allserious.    ah, it's just a casual thanksgiving With your girlfriend.    girlfriend? That sounds really serious.    joey I don't want to spend it alone.  [chuckles] Plus, uh I make the best pecan pie in the state of florida.    i guess i could, you know, Come by for dessert.    oh, so you just want to eat my pie.  Is that it?   [chuckles]   happy thanksgiving, mr.  mitchell.    happy thanksgiving.    i'll be at arthur's by 1:00, home by 4:00.  A serial killer's thanksgiving recipe for success.    how can none of these be big enough?   well, maybe if we, um [imitating julia child] turn the bird on its side And then  and, um   [laughter] Hey, dex.    howdy, pilgrim.    did you hear that the pilgrims didn't eat turkey On the first thanksgiving?   really?   they ate corn and eel, which the native americans Taught them to plant and fish.    then the pilgrims slaughtered them all, Took their food, and went to church the next day To thank god for all their good luck.    mm, it's a phase.  don't worry about it.    what you said about traditions shaping our kids My not going to work, will thatmisshape them?   [scoffs] look.  I wish it was otherwise, but you'll be home soon, right?   right.  i just   I don't want to do any damage.    [chuckles] you're a parent.  Parents do damage.  Hopefully we'll do enough of the good stuff To balance it out.    hopefully.  Thanks.    \"ashes to ashes\"   doughnut to doughnut.  It's all the store had left.    what are you doing here?   avoiding christine.  She can be a little intense.    tell me about it.  She keeps calling to set that interview with me.    you said you'd do it.    little busy here.  Look at the timing of the trinity kills.  What's the pattern?   long haul truck driver? Migrant worker?

Traditions matter, kyle.    yes, they Shape people.    yeah, and give children A sense of history, tradition.  Teaches them who they are and what's expected of them.    and what is expected of them?   generosity, common sense, obedience.  It's a father's responsibility to set the boundaries.  Child's duty to honor them.  No, there's nothing down there.  Stop! kyle, no! I made that When i was still confused.    well, it's beautiful.    which is why i haven't torn it apart.

My family is nothing like that.    what's 18 more years of being with you gonna do to them?   arthur's terrorized them into maintaining his cover.  They're nothing but human shields.    the only reason you started dating rita was for cover.    [sighs] She's much more than that now.  She and the kids.  much more.  My family is nothing like that.

How much did you tell christine about the lundy shooting?   nothing.    well, maybe you left lundy's file Lying around accidentally.    no.    and maybe christine saw some of the pictures.  She saw how he was lying on his side, How he fell in front of me, so that i could see him Take his last     morgan, i'm telling you, i learned my lesson.  I never even took the lundy files out of the station.  There's no way she could have seen it.    dinner's ready.    not all happy families are alike.  They are happy Aren't they? Are they normal kids? How can you tell a loving wife from a frightened one? A friendly neighbor.  Co worker.  Sister.  Son.  Are any of them what they seem?

I think he got too close, And i think it got him killed and me shot.    i can't even imagine looking into the eyes Of the person you love Watching as he takes his last breath.    how much did you tell christine About the lundy shooting? i learned my lesson.  I never even took the lundy files out of the station.  There's no way she could have seen it.  how did she know that? How tall was my shooter? my height.  then it wasn't trinity.  Look, i know it's really tough for reporters right now, So maybe i can give you That interview you've been wanting from me.  i'm married.  we have this connection.  i have dexter.    that smudge you found at the crime scene   How do you think he got the ashes to stick to the wall?   we got the killer's goddamn dna.  going out of town?   yeah.  a four walls build.  an out of town build   Is his cycle starting over again?   this is where it all started.  Vera saw me.  I startled her, and she slipped Shattered the shower doors.  The glass sliced her leg.  She was dead by the time the ambulance came.  Don't touch my sister! fuck you and fuck vera.  get the fuck off him! I should have fucking killed you when i had the chance.  hi, dad.  a hypodermic needle.  The perfect drug delivery system.

I don't know how you're not a complete wreck.  serial killer.  remember? Well, a little pain now means a lot less later on.  I should know.  I had my chance to eliminate arthur early on.  I didn't and now   we ready?   okay, buddy, look at daddy.    i know, i know, i know.    all right, that's one down.  three more to go.    the good news is, you won't remember any of this.  I didn't remember what happened to me as a child Until i was forced to.  Keeping my tools in a shipping container Makes more sense than a backyard shed.  After all, it's where my dark passenger was born.  And, after tonight, It's where arthur mitchell will call home.  Arthur is a man of ritual, like me.  Gas up the car, a quick stop at starbucks, Choir practice And that's where i'm going to take him When he's alone in the parking lot of his church.  Wait.  why isn't he stopping?   scott, hold your sister's hand until we're inside.  you're not my mother.    if arthur thinks he can lose me in a crowd, He's dead wrong.  \"nick, barb, scott Abby. \" i know that look.  I'm not the only one on a stalk.  But it's too soon.  Arthur just finished his last kill cycle.  By saving his life, have i set it all in motion again? Where'd you go?   scott, i'm officer carney.  am   am i in trouble? no, no.  Are your mom and dad nick and barb? yes.    i'm afraid they've been in a car accident.  are they okay?   they're gonna be fine, but they've asked me to take you To go see them in the hospital.    we have to go get my sister.    no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  My partner's got abby in our patrol car.  Come on.  I'm just glad i found you.    it wasn't the babysitter he was after.  this isn't a police car.  i work undercover.  wait, where's my sister?   well, let me radio in and see where my partner is.  arthur! shit.    kyle, i don't appreciate being followed.    arthur, what are you doing?   i don't know what you think you saw, But i promise i'll preserve this boy's innocence.  i'm calling the police.    if i so much as see a police car, The boy pays the price.  You like protecting children, don't you? Like my son.    arthur, just pull over.  tell me where you are.  i have a process.  As long as it's not interrupted, I'll set the boy free.    arthur, don't do this.  let the boy go.    dexter, he's gonna kill that child.    he's never taken a child before.  that you know of.  If this is new, this is on you.  not if i find him first.  mr.  butler? where's your mother?   she's picking up rebecca from ballet, But she'll be back any minute.  I really don't think that you   jonah, don't talk.  Just listen and answer.  Do you have any idea where your father is?   he's at some teaching thing up in naples.  how long? a couple days.    a couple of days.  good.  If arthur's process takes that long, The boy still has time.    you know, it's like thanksgiving never happened.  except for this.  Why are you still here?   i can't leave my mom and sister alone with him, And my mom won't leave, so i'm fucked.    look, i need to find your dad, and fast.  I need your help.    don't you understand? The longer he's gone, the better, for all of us.    jonah, we both know what he's capable of.    did   did he hurt someone else? i hope not.  That's why i need to find him To keep him from doing something really wrong.  You have the chance to finally break the cycle.  what do you want me to do?   go through his desk, journals, computer.  Anything, everything.  Find out what he's been working on.  he'd kill me.    i'll make sure he never finds out.  you know, i I'm   i'm not   i'm not sure if i can   If i can do it.  That's my mom and rebecca.    there is a great big shit ugly world out there, jonah.  The bad stuff doesn't just end at your doorstep.  You can help put an end to all of it.    to all of what?   the sins of your father.  Help me, jonah.  where am i? What is this place?   do you like trains, arthur?   my name isn't arthur.  it's scott.  look at that.  It's a thing of beauty.  i want my mom and dad.  whoo whoo.  Choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo Choo choo choo choo choo choo choo.  Whoo whoo.    if arthur's ritual, like mine, was born in the past, The past is where i'll find him.  His last cycle of kills took place in new orleans.  Matthew hicks, ten years old, Went to the local pool, never came home.  Five days before a woman was found murdered in her bathtub.  Before?   you always did have a soft spot for kids.  They remind you of what you lost that day In the shipping container.  innocence.    arthur said that's what he would preserve In the boy he took.  If each of arthur's victims Represents members of his family, Then the boy must be arthur himself.  He was ten when his sister died.  Omaha, another ten year old goes missing.  Five days later, another bathtub murder.  St.  paul.  Denver.  lundy misread the pattern.    it's not three victims he leaves behind; it's four.  Lundy didn't think to look at missing children Because they were never recorded as homicides.  which means five days Before the lisa bell bathtub murder here in miami   another ten year old went missing.  My god.  the boys begin the cycle.  hey.  sorry.  working late.  like always.  is everything okay? harrison isn't sleeping, So i'm gonna keep him in our bed tonight.  i'll be there in a sec.  okay.    arthur could have that boy anywhere, And now there'll be an army of police And volunteers surrounding his parents To help find their son.  I need to be one of them.  If arthur picked this particular boy for a reason, I need to know.  Come in.    hey, dex, you wanted to see me?   gordy, thanks for coming.    yeah, sure, no sweat.  what's up?   i dinged a parked van last night, And i left a note, But the driver hasn't called me back.  And i'm thinking, after i totaled my car, I can't afford To let the insurance companies get involved.  You think you can do a stake and notify So i can find this guy, pay him in cash?   yeah, sure.  just, uh, give me the plate, And if patrol spots your van, I'll give you a heads up on its location.  perfect.    hold on.  as soon as he's done with the uni, i'm next.    next for what?   i have to talk to him.  he's right in there.    i'm still figuring out how to phrase it.  how gay are you? look, i   I saw something at thanksgiving i wish i hadn't.    morgan.    gordon.  Jesus, ever hear of a comb? It looks like you have a cat on your head.    i'm kind of on a mission here.  what's up?   i've got that interview with quinn's squeeze today.  christine? Are you sure it's a good idea To dredge up all that lundy stuff?   actually, i've got a few questions for her.  I think she might have some ideas about who shot him.  The real question is, do i give quinn a heads up or   no, you don't.  I gotta go.    just no? he's my partner.    yeah, he's also her boyfriend.  You don't know where his loyalties are.  Deb, i've got field work i've got to do.    yeah, and i've got a briefing on trinity In, like, two minutes.  My case.  I need your big brain, bro.    there's no new blood.  there's no need.  no way.  You do realize i will stand here all fucking morning.  If trinity works in the public school system And we can't get the okay to swab these guys, We are beyond boned.    if he's even in the school system.  Sorry, deb, but the sooner this is over, The sooner i get to that missing boy's parents.    we've had better luck with private schools, And so far we're looking at 240 males Who fit our trinity profile.    well, collect their samples and get them to masuka.    oh, wonderful.  more old man spit.    dexter, i need the blood evidence in that bar stabbing.  proofing it.    proof faster.  prelim's tomorrow.  Where are we on the lundy shooting?   i'm still on the foreign nationals That were staying at the hotel.  So, no significant developments.    when you say it like that, no.  okay.    hey, uh, dex, you got a minute? It's about thanksgiving.  later, vince.  uh Okay.    uh, lieutenant, could you authorize this requisition? Could it be so wrong if you and i Hopped on the first plane to an island somewhere?   yes, and this isn't a requisition.  It's a thai menu.    mm hmm.    thank you for bringing that to my attention, sergeant.    start at community colleges, work our way up? detectives.  babe?   keep it in your pants.  she's here to see me.    oh, you're finally doing the interview? she is persistent.  tell me about it.  and when i'm done, Everyone in miami is gonna know what a true hero is.    don't forget your partner.  that's quinn with two ns.    oh, shit, i forgot to run something by batista.  Will you show her to the box? And i'll be there in two seconds? yeah.    i need you to watch christine interview me.  and i would do that why?   this could have something to do with the lundy shooting.  No significant developments, remember? okay.  i'm hungry.    well, why don't you put your pajamas on And we'll have something to eat.  no, i won't do it.  I won't do anything you tell me to.  don't you understand? Father drinks, and mother pays the price.  I'm just trying to protect you, arthur.  my name is scott! very well.    mr.  smith.    yes.    i'm dexter morgan, miami metro.  I'm not here in any official capacity.  I just want to do anything i can To help find your missing son.    we haven't set up phone banks yet, But, uh, we have some flyers.  may i take some with me? great.    i'm the only one here who knows what happened.  I could point the police in arthur mitchell's direction.  But the slightest misstep on their part Ensures this family is never whole again.    is there any information at all on your son? A tip, a lead, a phone call? Anything that could point me in a direction? none.  I keep waiting for a ransom note.  Something.    i'd better go post these.  I'm gonna do everything i can to help you get your son back.  thank you.    can you imagine walking by your kid's empty bedroom, Not knowing where he is? no.  i can't.    how does a guy like this make a dead body Just disappear into thin air?   the gulf stream does the trick for me.    but there's no ocean in omaha, Des moines, st.  paul, or denver.  the four walls houses.  He goes to each one of those cities on a build As a pretext for his killing cycle.  construction site Would be a convenient place to bury a body.  or to hold a boy captive.  three years on patrol, Two years in vice.  Why homicide?   my dad was a detective here.  hmm.    but it was completely different being a cop back then.    yeah, i bet.  talk about your man's world.    oh, no, no, it wasn't just that.  I think you had to rely more on your instincts back then.  There wasn't all this forensics stuff To lean on to break a case.  Back then, you had to rely on your gut.  amen to that.  have you seen these?   forensically, we're at a dead end with the lundy case, So i just stare at these, looking for answers.  you know what? I've got enough background info.  How about i just write this up and give you a call If, uh, we didn't cover everything? sure.  Can i ask you something? You live over in the gables, right? yeah.    ah, that must be really nice, Being away from all that touristy stuff.    well, i got lucky.  found a great building.    yeah, so the gables, that's what, like, uh, where frank was staying?   i guess.    wow.  You sure got to the crime scene fast.  There's no traffic at 5:00 a. m.  oh, i know that.  But dispatch didn't put out the call till 5:05.  You were the first reporter on scene at 5:20.    i like to roll out of bed and hit the gym early.  I was on my way there when i heard the scanner.    bullshit.  she's lying.    um, how do i get out of here?   you just follow the windows Till you get to the elevator.    we've got to tread very, very lightly with it.  If quinn     no shit.  That's why i'm asking you to help me sort through this.  Tell me i'm not crazy.    you're not crazy.  I spoke to christine at your crime scene.  Hair made, full makeup.  No way she rolled out of bed at 5:00 a. m.  looking like that.    i'm telling you she knows more than she's letting on.  She's a hard boiled crime scene reporter, And she couldn't even fucking look at those photos of lundy.    suspicious, but it doesn't prove a thing.    well, there's something else.  I know it sounds weird, but the other day, She was talking to me about how i was Looking in lundy's eyes when he died.  How the fuck does she know he didn't die instantly?   laguerta got broward county school district To let us collect samples.  Still working on dade.    great.  everything okay? yeah.  great.  Be right there.  great.    we can't be doing this with quinn around.  thank you.  build's nearly finished.  No one's here.  They're not here.  Fuck! Hello?   kyle, i went through my dad's desk.  You know, there's nothing here.  what about his computer? i already looked.  There's   it's just school stuff.    look at the search history.  does anything stand out?   okay, okay, okay.  one sec, one sec.  Nothing, really.  We got some bible stuff.  A hardware store.  a real estate agency.  The local paper.    the real estate site.  What was he looking at? uh, let's see.  It's just a bunch of homes for sale.  an empty house.  Good place to ensure his process isn't disturbed.    i can email you the list if you want.  I don't have email.    who doesn't have email, kyle?   off the top of my head, people who don't exist.  Fax them to the kinko's near your house under my name.  I'll pick them up there.  okay.    jonah, you're doing the right thing.  you know, how   How come you're the only one Who can see my dad for what he is?   we have a few things in common.    police are searching for a north miami boy Who went missing last night.  Ten year old scott smith was in an arcade with his sister And their nanny at around 7:45 p. m.  When the nanny, susan peterson, Realized that scott was no longer at her side.  fight, fight, fight! Fight, fight, fight, fight, fight! cody?   let go.  let go of him, cody.    cody! cody, come here.  cody, what are you doing?   he said he saw dexter leave the young sailors camp out In the middle of the night 'cause he was scared, So i hit him.    i'm so sorry.  boys, huh?   if my son said that's what he saw, I believe him.  Come on.  why, hello.  I'm so glad i finally got you.    actually, i'm in the middle of a project.    dad, i really need to see you.    you just did.  thanksgiving night.    i can't wait another four months until my birthday.  Can we meet in between our usual visits? Just this once?   there's a reason why we only see each other A couple of times a year, christine.  I have a full life and a family who needs me.  i'm your family too.  I need you.  more than they do.    sorry, sweetie, it'll have to wait.  Love you.  i think i'm in trouble.  Dad?   so are you gonna let me go? in due time, arthur.    why do you keep calling me that? is that food for me?   you can have something to eat Once you put your pajamas on, arthur.  Oh, this is delicious.    so far i've looked at six empty houses on jonah's list.  This one, not so empty.  hey.    dexter, are you on your way home?   just finishing up a few things.    oh.  the baby has a fever.  How long do you think you're gonna be? not very.  There's still another house i can check on the way home.  scott? Scott smith?   me and my kids got nowhere else to be.  My babies just need a place to feel safe at night.  We don't make a mess or nothin'.  You ain't gonna tell? no.  No, i won't.  shh.  Thank god.  Hey, can you take him? yeah.  Oh, he's so warm.    yeah.  those shots really did a number on him.  Look, can you take his temperature again? The thermometer's on the counter.  You're late.  big day?   yeah, i was helping out with that missing boy.    oh, that's so sweet.  those poor parents.  Speaking of which, paul's folks called.  They want to take the kids to disney world one weekend.    you sure that's a good idea? I've never even met them.  they're nothing like paul.  He was the abusive black sheep of the family.  Plus, i think it would be good for cody right now.  what happened to his eye?   one of the young sailors said you disappeared The night of the camping trip.  Cody was defending your honor.  huh.  The only time i left my tent that night Was to find a tree.    well, cody doesn't want to be part of the group anymore.  He said he doesn't want to be around somebody who tells lies.  too late.  oy.  You mind giving him a sponge bath, cool him off? Food will be ready when you're done.    okay.    okay.  this is so frustrating.  None of it makes any fucking sense.    what if christine was covering for a source That knew something about this? possibly.  I couldn't even look quinn in the eye.  don't worry.  We're gonna figure this out.  We just gotta think outside the box.    how's this for outside the box? Christine's the same height as the shooter.    christine shoots lundy.  why?   beats the mother fuck out of me.  She doesn't have a record.  you ran her prints? after the interview, I lifted them off some pictures i got her to pick up.    maybe she has priors that she hasn't been nailed on.    we get her dna, we check it against the database.  you and i both know We don't have enough to get a warrant.    think outside the box, sergeant.    nothing like clean, cool water, Huh, big guy? You'll be as good as new in no time.  But will i? I killed an innocent man When i left the campsite that night.  Now rita and cody have been drawn into defending a lie.  My lie.  Trinity's not the only one Using his family as human shields.    are you out of your fucking mind? No way christine had anything To do with shooting you or lundy!   you've been dating her for what, two months? How well do you even fucking know her?   what is this, some morgan vendetta against me? Is your asshole brother behind this?   why the fuck would my brother have anything to do with this? forget it.  it   Look, you're probably right about christine, And i am totally off base, But you're a cop, and a good one, And i know you know what it's like When you have a hunch.    who else knows about this? batista.    great.  you're making me look like a fucking asshole.    don't make this about you.  Does she keep a toothbrush here? Christine will never know about this.  And when the results come back clean, You can shove this up my ass anytime you want.  I need you to get a dna panel on this asap.  that's your emergency? project runway is on.  fuck you.    i'll owe you one, all right?   who's it belong to?   we may have a big fucking lead on the lundy case, And just fucking run it.    six houses down, another eight to go, And i'm running out of time.  Morgan.    dexter, where the hell are you?   en route.  traffic.    okay, well, the da's all over me about that blood report.    i'll have it on your desk in half an hour.  what? i was just thinking.  Christmas is coming up.  You got any plans? you and me.  what about your family?   hmm.  we're not that close.    i guess that's why you never talk about them.    have you seen my toothbrush?   oh, the cleaning lady must have thrown it out by mistake.    she's jealous of my perfect teeth.  here.  brand new.  are you okay? yeah.  yeah? Are you sure? now's not a good time.    well, maybe it is a good time for me.  You ever consider that? wow.  um   this is about your partner, isn't it? Did she say something to you? about what?   she gave a shitty interview.  I'm ditching the article.    so you think she's pissed about that?   i don't know.  it doesn't matter.  I'm gonna be late for work.  Daddy, i can't wait.  i need to see you now.  We might be in trouble.  We have to talk about, uh That woman in the bathtub that night When i was little.  Please call me back.  please.    now what'll we call this station? why can't i go home?   northern springs? rainbow valley? How about, uh, copper flats? this is stupid! You should take me home.

In a very happy turn of events, Ten year old scott smith Was reunited with his parents earlier today.  Although police have no leads as to who abducted the boy Or how he came to be returned, His family is simply happy he's home.    interesting.    authorities say they will continue their investigation.    with all the dna samples from my sister's sweep, There should be one bad guy I can cast in the role of trinity.  But i'm striking out.    hello.    let me ask you a question.  What kind of a man Witnesses a child abduction And doesn't call the police? Who are you, kyle? What is it you want?   money.    money? Is that what all this is about?   i want $50,000, Or i'll tell the whole world That arthur mitchell, family man, Schoolteacher, church deacon, Is a pedophile.    i am most certainly not a pedophile.    50,000.  right now.    i'm a schoolteacher.  I don't have that kind of money.    take a loan out on your house.  Sell your car.  i really don't care.  I want the money today.    that's not possible.  I'm not even in miami.    where are you?   well, i'm not gonna tell you that, am i, kyle?   it doesn't matter.  You have 24 hours to get me the money.    i'll, uh   i'll be in touch.    but i don't know anything.    you know about morgan and lundy's shooting.  More than you should.  And you share trinity's dna.  I can play this game All day long.  But you're in here Until you tell us what we need to know.    you can't do that.  You can only hold me for 48 hours.    if you were under arrest.  But we're holding you as a material witness.    so you can keep me as long as you want.    that's right, So you better start talking, bitch.    she says she doesn't know anything.    and, what, you believe her? I know this sucks for you, But she's in there because she's involved, So get your fuckin' head on straight.    we don't have any proof.    come on, quinn.  you're a detective.  What does your gut say?   i don't know.    you're too close to this.    i'm not the only one too close.    she say anything yet?   nope.  she won't.    let's hope not.  For quinn's sake.    fuck you.    huh.  And you.  Keep me posted.    whoa, where you going, half day?   to find a trinity decoy Before christine says the magic words.

I want both of you.  In your office.  now.  This is security footage Of a robbery in coconut grove last night.  Fortunately, our detectives Were able to i. d.  the suspect And make an arrest.  But they sent this up to me For a whole other reason.  A half hour before, The security cameras recorded this.    chief, we were off duty, and   two of my senior people Who had signed sworn affidavits with the department Stating that there was No romantic involvement between them.    if you'd just let me explain     there's nothing to explain.  You both lied under oath.  You committed perjury, and that's a felony.    look, i understand that we made a mistake, And if necessary, we're willing to accept the consequences, But this is     you went back on your word, And then you rubbed my face in it.  Your board of review hearing is the day after tomorrow.  I suggest you call your union reps And start looking into career alternatives.    wait a se   hang on.  This isn't the first time That you and i have squared off, So what exactly is your beef with me? My gender? my race?

Before her lawyer gets here, Let me take a shot at her.  I thought you might want to refuel.  Breakfast burrito.    no, i don't eat that shit.    i figured.  that's for me.    you put some kind of drug in there to make me talk?   you watch way too much tv.  I get it, why you did what you did.  To protect your dad.  I would have done the same thing.  My dad and i were close too.  Actually, we weren't.  I wanted us to be, But he never noticed.  He was always too busy with my brother and work.    is that why you became a cop?   yes, actually.    hmm.  You thought that maybe, Just maybe, if you became a cop like him, He'd give you that approval You'd been so hungry for?   well, when you say it like that, It sounds like a giant cliche.    that's because it is.  I don't want to talk about your daddy issues, okay?   fine.  Let's talk about yours.    hmm.  Oh, you don't know anything about me.    i know you can still do the right thing.  One day, i grew up.

You watch too much tv.    how'd it go?   it didn't.  Now what?   well, her lawyer's insisting that we let her go.    let who go?   christine.    well, if she cares enough about her father To lie for him   he could be her first stop if we cut her loose.    lead us right to him.    you take care of this? i got a meeting.    i'm here.    this is our witness?   uh, dexter morgan, say hello to judge belford.    i need you to sign here and here.

Looking for the 10 20 On one stan \"the man\" beaudry, Driving a black peter car out of j town.    uh, copy, little chopper.  Just saw him pulling into freddy's truck stop Off the 91 exit.    thank you, driver.  Arthur.    i'm standing in front of your house, kyle.    what?   i called the four walls office For your home address.  Seems to be johnny's jet skis.    they're fun.  you should try one.    what this tells me is you've been lying to me From the very beginning.    well, in the big scheme of things, Being a liar isn't nearly as bad as being a pedophile.    do not call me that!   i want my $50,000.  Why should i trust you to be silent After i've given you the money?   here's what you can trust.  If you don't meet me with the money, I'll call your family, your school, And then the police.    give me until tomorrow.    how do i know i can trust you?   i guess that's just the world we live in, kyle.  ? ?   you don't let me out of here, I'm gonna kick your fuckin' ass! Aah! you fuck! What the fuck are you doing?   normally, we'd have a little chat.  I'd show you the error of your ways.  But i'm kind of in a hurry here.    oh, i am gonna fuck you up!   uh huh.    i'm gonna rip your heart out!   yeah, i heard.    i'm gonna gut you like a fuckin' pig! You'll be sorry that you ever crossed me! Aah!   i just need to make sure The police find arthur's dna.  When they see this picture of christine, They'll think she's beaudry's daughter.  Lundy's trinity books.    thanks.  Only be a minute.  Mine's dead.  Don't have a land line.    hello.    daddy.  It's me.  I'm sorry i haven't returned your calls.  I've been   i know where you've been.  Don't call me anymore.  you understand?   d daddy, i just     it's slightly unbelievable that beaudry Would even own a toothbrush, But i'm gonna go for it.  And now, the final piece of the puzzle.  I think i'm done.  Stan beaudry is now the trinity killer.  Love thy neighbor.  Bullshit.  I should leave it alone.  Go inside.  Watch the history channel.  Hey, elliot.    dex.    stay the hell away from my wife.    jesus.  dex Aah.  wow.  okay.  Uh, i guess i deserved that.  Now, now wait.  I know i'm an asshole, But just wait a minute.  I got caught up in a moment.  Rita's amazing.    you think i don't know that?   and i'm an idiot.  And if i were you, I would want to kill me too.    don't ever touch her again.    your hand.    yousaw?   i saw.  You're not mad?   no.  I'm not mad.    what are you?   glad.  That you cared that much.  Can't believe you hit him, though.    i know.    i didn't see that coming.    i didn't either.    professional courtesy dictates We give you a heads up.    mm hmm.  we're married.    as in man and wife.    well, i don't see how that changes the facts of the matter.    it's certainly gonna change the context of your accusation.    do you really want to go in front of the board of review And attack the sacrament of holy matrimony?   the issue here is perjury.    alleging an affair is one thing, But now you'd be going after us For embracing the bedrock of family values.    in heavily catholic, And heavily latino miami.    you'll come across as a soulless, Anti family schmuck.    but if that's what you want to do, We'll take the fight.    it's also worth noting That the chief of police Met his now wife On the job as well.    you can lecture him On how he is in violation Of department protocol.    i can only marvel at the level of cynicism.  Using the institution of marriage As a cheap political ploy.  You must be very proud of yourselves For being so clever.    you didn't give us a lot of options.    i hope that your life together Will not be as empty and as amoral As your decision to get married was.    we did the right thing.    of course we did.    batista.  Okay.  We just got a lead on the trinity killer.    according to this, He had a delivery two days ago in jacksonville, And due back here last night.    yeah, well, i'm guessing christine Found a way to warn him off.    well, hello, mr.  toothbrush.    don't forget mr.  comb.    oh, yeah.  We've got some dna going on in here.    great.    dex, That guy that was bludgeoned, You remember the kind of hammer?   uh, it was a grant     24 ounce framing hammer?   we got him.    it's a little hard to believe this is the same guy That never made a mistake in 30 years.    ah, i'm sure he made mistakes.  We just weren't looking.    a truck stop employee Noticed stan beaudry's truck during the night.  Preliminary investigations Reveals evidence pertinent to the trinity killings.  At this point, We're trying to locate mr.  stan beaudry.  He's become our number one suspect.    stan beaudry?   kyle?   daddy.    i told you not to call me.    i'm in trouble, daddy.

        "script": "Previously on Dexter Dexter Morgan, good suburban husband, happy father of three living the dream.  Daddy kills people.  It's always the same three kills with Trinity: A young woman in a bathtub\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 followed by a mother falling to her death.  And ending with a man getting bludgeoned.  Trinity he doesn't belong here.  It doesn't make sense.    Hi, honey.    Trinity's a husband.  A father.  He's like me.  Lundy came to Miami to hunt this guy.  I think he got too close, and I think it got him killed.  I need a partner, Dexter.  Someone I can trust.  Unless you can be completely honest with me, I don't want to do this anymore.  I'm married.  Stay the hell away from my wife.  Ah! There's only one person who can help me.    Arthur Mitchell.    Kyle butler.  Four walls, one heart.  We build homes for the homeless.  Still so much to learn about handling the kids And the wife.    Choose your weapon.    Or maybe not.  Kill him now.  No more confessions, no more good deeds, \u00e2\u0080\u00a6and no more fucking remorse.  This isn't how you die.  It's been my dad's baby for years.  Fucking hate you! Fucking asshole! Get the fuck off of him! I should have fucking killed you when I had the chance.  Did you and my father have a romantic relationship? I was one of his girlfriends, if that's what you're asking.  There were others? Laura Moser, my mother.    You remember now?   I have a brother.  Watch your mom die It's all right, little guy.  You're safe now.  Arthur! Oh, my god.  The boys begin the cycle.  If I can make the police think The Trinity Killer is someone else, Arthur's all mine.  Stan Beaudry.  A decoy.  I just need to make sure the police find Arthur's DNA.  Stan Beaudry is now the Trinity Killer.    I killed Lundy.    Wait No! Don't, don't! Who are you, Kyle? What is it you want? Hello Dexter Morgan.  He knows my name, occupation.  He can find out about my family.  My family.  What the hell have I done? I'm sorry, sir.  You're on the wrong floor.  No, it's exactly the right floor.  We should talk somewhere else.  Somewhere private so you can extort money from the Trinity Killer? So what do you want? I want you to disappear from my life.  Like a ghost.  A really annoying ghost.  And you'll disappear from my life? I couldn't care less about your life.  Or death.  Unless you get in my way.  If I were you, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d give up vigilante ism.  You're not very good at it.  Good bye Dexter Morgan.  He's right.  I screwed up.  I let it come to this.  But no more.  No fucking more.  Morgan.  Come on, Quinn.  Not today.  Jesus, Morgan, middle of the day, you're out again? Yeah, I have some secondary analysis to do on the Kyle Butler case.  There's a spatter report on Christine hill's suicide Sitting on your desk  You even look at it? I don't need to.  It's a cut And Dry suicide.  Yeah, but you have to sign off on it.  That's how it works  You sign off, case closed.  It gets put in a file cabinet So I don't have to think about it or hear about it Or be fucking reminded of    I'll get to it.  What, when you're done chasing tail? You do not want to question my loyalty to my family, Quinn.  Not today.  Do your fucking job! Great.  Fucking mess.  Do you even have a plan here? Follow him and look for an opportunity.  What if he keeps on driving? Then I keep on driving.  It's Rita.    Don't answer it.  Could be important, about the baby or something.  Hey, you.  I have something very important to say.  Everything okay? I want my honeymoon with you This weekend.  It's not really a good time.  It's a perfect time.  Astor and Cody will be in Disney world.    With Paul\u00e2\u0080\u0099s parents.  I know, I remember.    And Harrison will be with us, but it'll still be romantic.  I think it's fantastic.  Great.  I'll start booking flights and a hotel    Hey!   Gotta go.  What the fuck, man! Told you not to answer it.  I'll deal with it later.  The messes are piling up.    Isolated.  No security.  Perfect.  Gotta risk it.  May be the only opportunity I get.  Three post cards don't have a match.  Trinity sent these to Christine from Cheyenne, Topeka, and Bloomington, Illinois.    Morgan    Lundy never uncovered Trinity killings in these cities which means there could be as many more as nine murders.    Go home.    I'm gonna call homicide In each of these cities.  Christine hill just committed suicide.  In front of you.  Four hours ago.  Now, take a personal day.  Get some closure.  That's an order.    These cities  I'll call their homicide departments.  Stan Beaudry is  Is our number one Trinity suspect.  We're on it.  What's she still doing here? She's going.  Closure, huh? Some of the cities on these post cards what? You're my husband.  And I have a wife.  So what do we do now? We find the Trinity Killer.  No.  I mean, do we move in together? Married people do that.    My house?   Your house sounds fine.    Valerie? Debra Morgan.  Yeah, fine.  You said my dad left you for another C. I. ? You followed him to her house? Any chance you remember where she lives? Really? Great.  My day just got wide open.  You up for a road trip? Finally, it's over.  Savings account closed.  Checking account closed.  You were gonna leave town, weren't you? And probably leave your family destitute too.  Eventually the police will see through Stan Beaudry, And they'll get on to you.  But you'll be missing with all your money, And everyone will assume that you skipped the country.  Luck is finally working with me.  That's the car right there That swiped me over on riverside.  Seriously? Fuck! Hey, that's him! That's the prick.    Who, me?   You fucking hit my car! Learn how to drive, you idiot.  'Cause being rude always helps In a tense situation, right? Calm down.  Look, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sorry.  I was on my way to a crime scene.  Miami Metro, forensics.  Come on, he's working the whole cop brotherhood angle? No one's above the law, pal.  Okay.  Be cool.  Diplomatic.  Look, obviously, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll pay for whatever the damage is.  You fled the scene of an accident.  I didn't flee.  I was in a hurry.  To solve a crime.    So you stop at a bank? That's bullshit! I'm just asking for A little professional courtesy here.  You might pull that shit down at Miami Metro, But here at the sheriff's department, We don't put up with that shit.    Come on!   Caught on tape, asshole.  Don't fucking point that thing at me.  All right, come here.  Okay, buddy we're taking you in.  So much for diplomacy.  You sure this is the right block? Pretty sure.  Want one?   Quit.  Ugh.  I remember when your dad stopped, cold turkey.  If harry said he was gonna do something, he did it.  He was a good man.    He was a man whore.  Yeah, but he was a lot of other things too.  Like he always made me feel safe.  And the crowd I ran with  That meant a lot.  Here it is.  What's wrong?   Fucking can't be.    No.  This is it.  I remember the porch.  Why, what is it? I've been here before.  Aah! Oh, god! He brought me here.  Who did? The ice truck killer.  Brian Moser.  That was her name! Laura Moser.  She had two little boys.  Dad, who the hell were you? I don't have time for this shit.  Why are you even in here? Because of Arthur fucking Mitchell.  Wrong.  All right, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m here because I didn't follow the code.  Everything you taught me was to keep me out of here.    What else?   What do you want me to say? I'm here because I lost it? Yes.  I fucking lost it.  On a fucking cop! Like a fucking amateur.    Fuck you! It's your number one rule, don't get caught.  They were gonna find him.  They were gonna find me with an unconscious man.  That's not why you lost it.  That's not why you're in here.  I couldn't just let them find him, goddamn it.  I have to be the one to kill him.  I have to know he's gone.  For my family.  Exactly.  You can't think clearly because of them.  They've done this to you.  No, my dark passenger has done this to me.  It's ruining my life.  It is your life.  I don't want it to be.  I don't want it.    You said you had something?   Nothing good.  Been back Checking Stan Beaudry's trucking routes, Dug up a couple of past employers.  They put him 3,000 miles away from Pittsburgh in '89 And Sacramento in '92.  And Beaudry's only been connected to a prostitute kill.  Nothing ritualized about it.  I told Matthews It was too soon to release Beaudry to the press.  If he's not our guy, we're gonna look like fools.  I knew it wasn't Beaudry.  What? I'm smarter than the rest of you.  Then how do you explain Trinity's DNA showing up In Beaudry's rig and shack?   Yeah, smart man.  Well, I can't yet.  Sergeant, you find something? I spoke with Bloomington homicide.  I asked about the dates on this postmark.  Summer of '92, there was a bathtub murder, A jumper, and a bludgeoning.  I see a big \"but\" on your face.  What? Guy said it was The worst month of his life.  In addition to those murders, There was a ten Year Old boy missing Five days prior to the bathtub kill.  Last week, that ten year old boy went missing here.    Scott smith.    Exactly.  So I called a few cities.  Ten Year Old boys missing? Every time.  Five days before each cycle began.  And Lundy was only looking at homicides, Not missing persons.  Get Scott Smith down here.  Let's check every Trinity city For missing ten year olds.  We may be looking at a whole new pattern.  \"Brian and Dexter Moser\"? Dexter Morgan? Yeah.  It's your lucky day.  Yeah.  It feels like it.  We're outta bunks for the night.  There's a shot Arthur's still unconscious.  Bummer.  Yeah, well, budget cuts are gettin' worse and worse.  But since you're Miami Metro, We figured we could at least do you the favor Of calling your wife, have her come pick you up.  My wife? How is it I can kill people and feel no regret but disappointing Rita Makes me feel like the scum of the earth? I'm sorry.  I know.  I just had a bad day and let it get to me, I guess.  First it was smashing that light, Which was weird.  And then you punched Elliot, which I actually liked.  But now you pick a fight with a sheriff? I don't understand.  I want to, but I wish I could explain.    Try.  Please.  Sometimes I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m just goin' along, And everything seems okay, and then this darkness creeps in, and it takes over.  Makes you sound crazy.  Maybe I am.  No.  No, I don't believe that.  I'll be right behind you.  Shit.  Well, you actually think Dad'll let you go to the winter prom?   He doesn't have to know.    We can figure something out.  Arthur! We didn't know when to expect you  Bring me your jewelry  Gold, silver, Anything with a stone in it.  And all the cash in your purse.  Why? What's wrong? And your wedding ring.  No.  This is mine.  Arthur!   Hey! Don't, Jonah, no! Okay.    Daddy, what's happening? I need the money you keep behind your headboard.  Don't pretend.  I know it's there!   No, daddy Daddy, why    The silver pendant I gave you.  Now!   What the hell is goin' on? What did you do?   Arthur, please, no! You're lucky I don't pull the fillings out of your teeth! Don't ever question me! I gave you everything you have.  I will take it all away! Collect your things.  I've got some business to attend to.  Other than stealing from your family? Someone stole something from me.  And I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m gonna find him.  We We should just go.  Leave and never come back.  He'll find us.  This This is our chance.  He's He's in trouble.  He's insane.  Mom!   What? Please.  We'll live in fear.  We already do.  Debra.  Oh, sorry.  Detective Morgan.  Have a seat.  Thanks for your time, deputy chief.  I know you're busy.  I need to talk to you about a case.  It was one of my father's old cases from a long time ago.  And you're the only one still around from those days.  Suddenly I feel ancient.  Look, it was a quadruple homicide out at the ports.  In a shipping container.    You were there?   No.  Wasn't my case.  But I remember Harry's face when he came back from it.  Said he'd never seen so much blood.  My dad said Dexter's parents died in a car accident.  That's not true, is it? No.  My father's C. I. , Laura Moser, Was murdered in that shipping container.  She had two boys.  One of those boys was Dexter? Please tell me the truth.  Harry adopted him.  The other boy was too damaged by the incident.  No shit.  He grew up to be the ice truck killer.  You knew.  Debra, your father wanted to protect you.  He didn't want either one of you to ever know.  And you both turned out pretty damn well.  So I think he made the right call.  Yeah? Well, I know now.  What the hell am I supposed to do with this? You keep it to yourself.  Oh, fuck! Jesus! Quinn, what? I'll be right there.  We should go to the keys tomorrow.  For our honeymoon.  No, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not sure that's  You can fly down in the morning.  I'll follow you after work.  Have a spa day.  Indulge.  Please? Dexter, uh look, I know you're upset.  You have every right to be.  You had to pick up another husband from jail.  Y You think I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m upset because you're like Paul? I'm worse.  I know.    Dexter.  Whenever they picked up Paul, it was a relief.  And life got easier.  Without you you're the most important person in our lives.  What's upsetting me is the idea of losing you.  You have your demons.  I accept that.  Because I know that you don't have to be a slave to them.  I wish that were true.  It is.  I know you.  Better than you know yourself.  You can conquer Whatever darkness there is in you.  I know you can.  I want to be that man.    You already are.    Please.  Please fly to the keys tomorrow morning.  I wanna meet you.  Truly, there's nowhere I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d rather be.  Trinity sure went through a lot of effort To make us think that Beaudry was our guy.    Planting DNA.  Planting Lundy's murder books.  Have we heard back from any more homicide departments? Almost every town.  Ten Year Old boys missing in all of them.  Quinn is talking to Scott Smith now.  No, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not.  I called in someone who knows about being kidnapped.  Someone took me once too without my permission.  Were you scared? Most scared I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve ever been in my life.  And as much as I want to forget, There are all these little things I remember.  The way his breath smelled like medicine.  The bad man.  Used medicine on me.  When I was getting in the van.  Do you remember any little things about the van? It was empty.  Except for some papers.  There was a picture on it.  Do you remember what it looked like? Uh we're looking for this logo.  We've got something.  We walked cadaver dogs over the whole area.  They led us to this spot, and the guys started digging.  They found something buried under the patio.  All right, hold up.  Male victim.  Approximate age ten years old.  Badly decomposed.  Looks to be wearing pajamas.  They found Scott Smith wearing pajamas.  I'll call judge morales at home, Have her get a warrant started.  I'll get the names of everyone who volunteered on this build.  Make it everyone who volunteered for four walls Nationwide.  Cross Check 'em with Trinity's cities.  We'll find Trinity's real name, Then we'll take this motherfucker down.  You're a little piggy, Dexter Morgan.  \"Debra Morgan. \" Debra Morgan! Fucking Debra! Astor and Cody, Disneyworld awaits.  They'll be safe there with Mickey, Minnie, And their Goofy grandparents.  Now for the rest of my family.  Found it! Oh wish I could go with you right now.  Me too.  I just got a few loose ends To tie up at work, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll see you tonight.  Can't wait.  Me either.  Can't wait to be with my family.  Can't wait to be done with Arthur Mitchell.  I just need a clue where he's headed.  Receipts.  Drug store.  Auto shop estimate.  Dry cleaner, groceries, gas.  No bus, train, or plane tickets.  Only one other place I can check.  Mr.  Butler, what  Jonah, have you seen your father? Yeah, he blew through here last night Looking for anything he could sell.  Jonah! Who is Kyle.  He's asking about dad.  Can you tell me what's going on? I'm not sure.  I hope he stays gone this time.  He took everything.  It's gonna be okay.  I promise.  I'll make sure you get Arthur's money.  Did he say where he was headed? He never does.  Did he take his tools pack a bag? Does he have a passport? I don't know.  When we got up this morning, he was gone.  Shit.  Aah! Get down! Down on the ground! We create our own destiny every day we live.    Freeze! Hands up.    Forensics.  All right.  Dexter.  Where's your flak jacket? I left it in the car.  Do you see this? Cabron! And over here look.  It's a framing hammer.  I'll get Masuka in here, get some DNA.  What? How'd you get here so fast? Word's everywhere.  You found Trinity.  Yeah, the four walls national database Led us to Arthur Mitchell.  Can you believe that fucking monster had a family? And he abandoned them? He's gone? Yeah, he emptied out his bank accounts and disappeared.  He's probably halfway around the world by now.  Probably.  Deb, what's  Why don't you get your fucking flak jacket So everyone knows you're one of us? Hey it's the fucking Karate Kid.  Yeah, about that, uh you pull that shit again, Next time I won't be the one who's on my ass.  This is their future, Dexter.  We both know it's inevitable.  No.  Arthur abandoned his family.  I would never do that.  Arthur left his family too late.  The damage was already done.  You can still save your family.  By leaving them? You'll always need someone on your table.  If you stay, Sooner or later, you'll be caught, And they'll pay a terrible price for what you've done.  Because long after you're executed they'll still have to go through life With your name branded across their foreheads.  Dex.  I have something to tell you.  And maybe I shouldn't.  I don't know.  Okay.  I found another C. I.  dad was sleeping with.  A woman named Laura Moser.  Harry was right.  This is it.  Does that name mean anything to you?   Should it?   It doesn't? Look, she died, But she left behind two little boys.  And one of those little boys was you.  Laura Moser is your biological mother.    Don't say the rest.  Don't know it.  The other little boy, your brother, Was named Brian.  Brian Moser.  The ice truck killer.  She knows who I really am.  It's over.  I wasn't gonna tell you, but then I saw Trinity's family, And I thought that it's better for you to know the truth.  The truth? The truth that's a lot to take in.  I know.  And that's all she knows? You think Brian knew about me? I don't know.  He must have glommed onto you as a way to get to me.  Don't you see, it wasn't your fault.  He wasn't your fault.  If I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d never been in your life  Fuck you.  Fuck me? If you hadn't been in my life, I wouldn't be who I am.  You've given me confidence And support.  And you've been the one constant  The one constantly good thing in my life.  I've been good for her.  And Rita says I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m good for her and the kids.  No one would ever say that about Arthur.  Maybe Harry's wrong.  Maybe things could turn out differently for me.  Morgan.  Debra Morgan.  Need you inside.    I'll be right there.  I love you.  I'm so thankful.  The Mustang.  Arthur brought it in two days ago.  Should have known he wouldn't leave it behind.  Here.  Take the rest of this.  Mr.  Mitchell, this gonna be nice.  Ah, it's beautiful work, Julio.  Especially on such short notice.  Por favor, the paint.  The paint.  It needs more dry! tres horas mas! The wife had no clue what the husband was up to.  Do we believe her? She threw up when I showed her the pictures of what he did.  That can be faked.  This is the team that broke the case.  Lieutenant Laguerta, Special agent Davis of the FBI.  First Rate job.  Congratulations.  It was detective Morgan Who brought these killings to the department's attention.  Building on the work of one of your own.  Special agent Lundy.  Fuck yes, special agent Lundy.    He told you guys    It's been a long day.  No disrespect, but she's right.  I agree.  In retrospect, The bureau should have proceeded differently.  Well, your retrospect cost a man his life.  We'll be taking over from here.  So after we do all the heavy lifting  You get all the credit.  I'm sure they're grateful for all your hard work.  We are.  Motherfuck.  I know.  But it is what it is.    baby     won't you let me   Damn it to hell.    darlin'     won't you let me have your number     we can go and dance la bamba     let me, baby, let me do   Where's my fucking oil cap? Hello, Arthur Mitchell.  Ah! Guess you were picturing a different scenario.  I was following my path.  So was I.  God led you to me.  Hardly.  Is this who you are?   ta da   Oh, look at you.  I never took pride in what I did.  No, you're a very special kind of monster.  You destroyed your own family.    I gave them everything!   No, you took everything.  Their future.  Their dignity.  Their hope.  Christine even killed herself.  No! Because of you.  S  She was weak.  I can't believe there was a time When I actually thought I could learn something from you.  You think you're better than I am? No.  But I want to be.  You can't control the demon inside of you Any more than I can control mine.  Did you ever actually try? Oh, my god, yes.  I prayed to be changed.  To be made different.  That's not trying.  That's waiting to be stopped.  It worked, didn't it? Case in point.  So what's the alternative, Arthur? Leave? Disappear? Fake my own death and start over again? No.  You'll still be you.  I have a family too, Arthur.  And I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m good for them.  You're like a child.  A child with a big knife.  You dream of a heaven you'll never see.    I don't believe in heaven.    Oh, but you do.  This isn't your doing.  This is god's plan.  I accept that now.  You have to do the same.  I accept nothing.  Nothing is inevitable.  It's already over.  It's already over.  Could you thank you.    I promise that I always will be true     I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll give her all the love i have to give     as long as we both shall live     ooh ooh ooh ooh     ooh ooh ooh     hey, venus     oh, venus   Now it's over.    make my wish come true     ooh ooh ooh ooh     ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh   I wonder if Rita's looking at this same moon At this same moment.  I like that connected by light.  The dark passenger's been fighting against it, trying to keep me all to himself.  But it's my turn now to get what I want.  To embrace my family.  And maybe one day not so long from now I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be rid of the dark passenger.  It all begins with a getaway.  Time away from the old me.  It's okay.  Life doesn't have to be perfect.  It just has to be lived.  Unheard message.  Hey, sweetie, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m a dope.  I was in such a rush to get Harrison organized I forgot my ID.  For the plane, so I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m zooming home for it.  Means I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be on a later puddle jumper, but we'll still be there waiting for you.  Oh, and I know you're not into this stuff, but the moon tonight is gonna be amazing.  So take a moment.  You deserve it.  We love you.  Bye.  Rita? No.  Born in blood both of us.  Harry was right.  I thought I could change what I am, keep my family safe.  But it doesn't matter what I do, what I choose.  I'm what's wrong.  This is fate.      Previous EpisodeNext Episode"

        "script": "So, how the hell was your date with Rita last night? Great.  I think I met the right woman for me.  She's perfect, because Rita is as damaged as me.  I can't believe I found the one good, truly decent man left on the planet.    I have a dark side too.    Somehow I doubt that.  I watched my mother die when I was three.  She was murdered in front of me.  You have your demons, but I know that you don't have to be a slave to them.  I wish that were true.  I want to someday be content, like everyone else.    I want   A normal life.    I wanna marry you.    Yes! You guys are my family.  Now I have a partner for life.  I'm content.  Maybe even happy.  I hope you're not taking any of this seriously   the wife, the kids.  It's all great camouflage.  It's gotten more complicated than that.  I'm pregnant.  You want to see him come into the world.    Yes.  Raise him with Rita.    I know.  I've never wanted anything so much in my life.  Wanna know a secret? Daddy kills people.  There's a monster walking around free.  I call him the Trinity Killer.  Kills in threes.  Trinity's a husband, a father.  He's like me.  What kind of father keeps blood slides in his shed? If I don't figure out how to hide this, I'm gonna lose my family.  Arthur's kept this up for, what, 20 years? My family may not last 20 minutes.  Arthur Mitchell.  Kyle Butler.  Only way it was gonna work is if I jumped in with both feet.  Jump in with both feet, huh? This is your new role model, Dex? Get that axe from him.  Kill him now.  I still have things to learn from him.  You're juggling too many people, Dexter.  Blood tech, husband, father, serial killer.  Now Kyle Butler.  Which one are you? All of them.  Hello Dexter Morgan.  Hello, Arthur Mitchell.  Hey, sweetie.  The moon tonight is gonna be amazing.  So take a moment.  We love you.  Bye.  Rita? Born in blood.  Both of us.  I thought I could change what I am, keep my family safe.  But it doesn't matter what I do.  This is fate.  Sir, did you call this in? Sir.  What happened here? I've watched 67 people die, and at the moment of truth, I looked into their eyes and they knew and I knew they got what they deserved.  But what if that's not what happens? If you don't get what you deserve? If what you deserve is a white picket fence and your kids all around and a husband who loves you? What if the least you deserve is a real human being and what you get instead is me? Sir.  Sir, we're going to take the child into safe custody now.    Sir, hand me the child.    What are you doing?   Back off!   Ma'am! Miami Homicide.  He is too.  I said back the fuck off! What happened? Jesus.  Rita's inside.  It was me.  Skin's wrinkled from hours in the alkaline water.  Rigor mortis full blown.  Epidermal mottling.  I imagined her naked plenty of times, but never like this.  Single cut to the femoral artery.  We're looking at Trinity's MO here.  Did he ever kill a married woman in a bathtub? First time for everything.  Unfortunately for Dexter.  We're still waiting on the coroner to move the body.  But overall lividity puts time of death somewhere between eight and twelve hours ago.  You OK? Dexter came home to that.  He's gonna need our support here.  Obviously.  What do you want us to do with him? The first thing I want you to do is pack up and get out of there.    Well   What? The FBI's here.  Trinity is their case.  I already ceded jurisdiction.  What are you looking at him for? It's what I was saying on the way over.  Rita's one of ours.  She's family.  We should be working on this for Dexter.  Damn it, Angel, it's done! Just do what I say.  She's stressed.  We all are.  My father Harry taught me a few simple rules.  Ne\u00ce\u00bder hurt an innocent and never make a scene.  Harry? Where are you, now, when I really need you? When it's my wife in the body bag, everybody's looking, and it's the neighbour crying, not me? Sir? We're ready for you.  The first responders told me when they went inside and found your wife you said, \"It was me. \" You sure? That's what was reported to me, yeah.  I don't know what I said.  It could have been anything.  I'm very upset.  Of course you are.  Who wouldn't be? Mr Morgan, before you came home and found your wife, where did you say you were again? Dexter, take off your clothes, then we're going home.  I was asking him a question.  He already said he came home and he found her there.  If you wanna help, why don't you find Trinity? Or is doing something actually useful not in your fucking job description? Detective Morgan.  FBI? Fucking Bunch of Idiots.  Stop.  Finish up here, then take your brother home.  You wanna talk to Dexter, schedule an appointment.  I'll do that.  He can sleep on the floor until we can bring his crib over from the house.    It'll be safest, don't you think?   Yeah.  I gotta tell you, Dexter, don't say things like, \"It was me. \" People will misunderstand.  In fact, I don't understand.  What did you even mean? Dexter.  This is Dexter Morgan.  What is your emergency? I just got home and found my wife dead in the bathtub.    What is this?   The 911 call Dexter made.  Listen.  I just got home and found my wife dead in the bathtub.    Did you say your wife is dead?   Yes, I did.  She has an approximately one inch incision midway up her right thigh, dissecting the femoral artery.  All right.  That's enough.  He obviously is in shock.  \"Midway up her right thigh\"? \"Dissecting her femoral artery\"?   Habit of precision.    His wife just died.  He's submitting a lab report.  Seriously, the next door neighbour, the guy with the, you know, forehead? He was more broken up about Rita than Dexter was.    So?   So it's weird, that's all.    What are we working on here?   Not Rita.  It's Dexter's 911 call.  Did you hear me or not? I said the case is with the FBI now.  You should have taken her on a honeymoon.  You were right about one thing   that neighbour Elliot being all broken up about Rita.  I'm thinking now there's some things I shouldn't have told Dexter.  What? What shouldn't you have told him? About a significant exchange of saliva I witnessed at Thanksgiving.    As in a kiss.    Elliot and Rita? Dude was totally in love with her.    And Dexter knew?   Yeah.  If I'd known she was gonna I should have kept my big mouth shut.  Could someone get that? Deb? Damn it.  Hello.  Dexter, it's Maura.  Hello? I'm sorry if I woke you, but I have got two very excited kids here, and Rita's not answering.  Yeah, there's something you need to know.  OK.  OK, OK.  But first somebody really wants to talk with you.  Dexter! Hey, Cody, you OK? We've been having the best day.  I had cotton candy for breakfast.  That's great.  Here, give me the phone.  Gimme, gimme.  Hi, Dexter.  Can I talk to Mom?   Not now.    Why not? She's, uh She's in the shower.  Well, can you tell her we miss her? We miss you too, Dexter, and Harrison.  Here's my grandmother.  So, there was something that you needed to tell me? When you bring them home tonight, uh come to Deb's apartment instead of the house, OK? What happened, did you miss your flight? Something like that.  I'll explain when you get here.  You sure you don't want to tell them about Rita? I just want them to have one more good day.  Look, I know this is really difficult but there are a lot of things that need to happen before Rita can be buried.  I've been on the phone all morning with a funeral director who does a lot of cops.  And he's willing to see us right away.  You willing to do that? I'm sorry for your loss.  How does he do that? My sincere condolences.  He sounds like he actually means it.  Thank you.  Would you like something to drink? Coffee? Water? No.  I'm fine.  There are Kleenexes here if you need them.  What we need to do now, Dexter May I call you that? What we need to do now, Dexter, is make some very important decisions about how your wife Rita will be remembered.  OK.  We like to start with the obituary.  It's a good way to let people know about services and where to send remembrances.  But most importantly, it's a chance to express your feelings about Rita in your own words.  Excuse me.  I'll get you something for the paper.  What else do you need? So this is how normal people do it.  No hefty bags.  No diesel fumes.  This is what she would have wanted   a grieving spouse for once doing what a person's supposed to do.    Dexter Morgan?   Rita?   Hi.    Hi.  Sorry I'm late.    That's no problem.    There was traffic, of course.  I went to the wrong caf\u00c3\u00a9.  I went to the one in town.  I didn't know there was anything even out this far.  How did you find this place? I, uh tracked it down.  So, I Your sister Debra's told me so much about you.    Uh oh.    Oh.  Nothing bad, of course.  She omitted the fact that I'm an axe murderer? No.  She said that you were a bloodstain pattern analyst.  Which I have no clue what that is.  Believe me, I barely do either, and I do it 40 hours a week.  She seems nice, your sister.  You seem nice too.  Thank you.  So, um, what's good here? There must be something special to bring you all the way out this far.  I I usually play it safe and go with a Caesar salad.  But I don't see one on here.  You know, I think I'm gonna get the special, the mushroom ravioli.  Dexter?   Do you know what you want?   Yes, I do.  Dex.  What are you doing? I was just thinking about Rita, how much How much you miss her? How much I lied to her, from the very beginning.  Funeral's the day after tomorrow.  I chose an oak casket.  I hope that's all right.  White roses.  I think she'd like those.  They want to know if there's a particular dress you'd like her to be buried in.  Not really.  OK.  I'll find something.  Quinn called, and the FBI has released the crime scene at your house, so there are some things I want to do there and I'm gonna drop you two off at the apartment.  Is that OK? Yeah, that's fine.  You're worrying me.  I really didn't expect you to come.  We're partners.  I'm here.  What are we looking for? Nothing.  Trinity wouldn't leave anything behind.  What are we doing, then? I wanted to clean the place up.  Make sure Dexter didn't see it like this.  The FBI left it this way.  They have people who'll do that.  This much blood, usually you call Dexter.  How you holdin' up? OK.  I guess.  I mean, you know my brother.  It's a little hard to tell.  No, I mean you.  How are you holding up? Oh.  Fine.  Not used to having to be the strong one, you know? It's always been Dexter.    And now   He's the strong one? To me it's always seemed the other way around.  Swear to God, I can't even tell what he's thinking.  Sorry.  I didn't mean to make things worse.  It's OK.    What are you doing?   I don't know.  Open the door! Come on! Hurry, come on, open up! Dexter! Are you there? Open the door! Dexter, you came back early! Hey, guys.  Did you have fun?   It was awesome.    We got you stuff.    Perfect.    There's one for Mom too.  Where is she? She's not here.  Well, where is she? Just sit down.  I need to tell you something.  Dexter? Is everything OK? What's going on? You're You're freaking me out.  Something happened to your mom.  Something bad? Yeah.  Something bad.  Is she OK? A man came into our house, and your mother came home and he killed her.  What? She got killed?   Somebody killed her?   No, she's fine.  Dexter.  What You're kidding, right? I don't understand.  You said spend the day at Disney World.  I'm sorry for your loss.    Astor?   Go away.  I mean it! Leave me alone! Just listen to me.  Everything's gonna be OK.  It won't be.  She's dead! I know.  And it doesn't even matter to you.    How can you say that?   Cos it doesn't.  I can tell just by looking you don't even care.  Where were you? Where were you when someone was killing her? You should have been there to protect her.  You're right.    That was your job!   I know.  I should have been there, and I wish I could take it all back.  I wish that none of this had ever happened and your mom was still alive.  Wanna know what I wish? That it was just my mom and me and Cody and Harrison.  Cos we all would have been so much better off if she hadn't met you! I wish you were dead!   Do you mind?   What? Look somewhere else.  What are you doing? Jesus, Quinn, you can't grab a sheet or something? Sorry.  So, what are you doing? Trying to find a dress for Rita.  You gonna bury her in one of those? You got something better? Great.  I gotta go.  I gotta go home now.  You might wanna put some pants on there.  You wanna talk about it, or are you just gonna act weird?   There's nothing to talk about.    OK.  I mean, you show up here, which I didn't even ask you to do, so Yeah.  To help.  Is that what you call it? Morgan.  Elliot?   That's your name, right?   Yeah.  Hi.  Quinn.  Metro Homicide.  Hey.  You have kids, I take it.  Yeah.  They're with their mother.  We're divorced.  Plus, it just seemed better for them to get away after what happened next door.  Um you know, I already talked to the FBI.  I told them I didn't see anything.  What did you need? How well did you know Rita? I don't know, you know.  We were neighbours.  Yeah.  I just couldn't help but notice how torn up you were about her the other night.  She was a friend, you know? It was upsetting.  A friend.  I, uh, was told she might have been more.  Christ.  All right, look, I don't know what you've heard, but just so you understand the actual facts, all Rita and I ever did was kiss once.  That was it.  It was nothing.  Her husband was never around.  Anyway, Dexter found out about the indiscretion and, uh came over and punched me out.  Huh.    Dexter.    Shhh.  He's sleeping.  Brought some dresses for you to look at.  Where are Astor and Cody? At a hotel with their grandparents.  How'd it go talking with them? Astor's upset.  They got me a hat.  She'll be OK.  I don't see how.  Her mother's dead because of me.  No, she's not.  She's dead because of Trinity.  I know you keep blaming yourself, but you can't.  There's nothing you could have done differently.  I could have killed Arthur Mitchell the first chance I got.  You loved Rita.  You never would have let anything hurt her.  She was lucky to have you.  She told me that all the time.  How lucky she felt to have found you.  I was wondering what you were doing, sitting here by yourself for so long.  Now I see.  I paid her to say that.  You did? No, I was just kidding.  Me too.  So what does a blood spatter analyst do anyway? Excuse me.  Is this yours? What's the deal here? I have to go.  Is everything OK? It's a stomach bug.  It's going around the station.  I'm really sorry.  It was nice meeting you.  Lucky to have me.  I wouldn't say so.  She trusted me, and now she's dead.  Like your sister says, I'm toxic.  You'd all be better off without me.  Delete the past.  Leave nothing behind.  You're up early.  What are you doing over there that's so important? Getting rid of every trace of me.    Nothing.    Dexter Look, I know this is tough to talk about, but the funeral's tomorrow, and there's still a lot of stuff you have to do.  Like sign the coroner's release.  I need to grab my tools.  And go over the guest list one more time.  And torch the container.  And the eulogy, Dexter.  I can't do that for you.  That really has to come from you.  I need to top off my boat.  I'm low on fuel.  Yeah.  And the FBI interview, or the debriefing or whatever they're calling it   that's really important.  They're total dicks for wanting to do it today, but maybe you're better offjust going in there and getting it over with.  You sure you don't want me to come with you? No.  I'm fine.  All right.  I'm off.  I've been thinking about Harrison.  How he needs his mother.  Someone decent in his life.  You've done everything for me.  Not just now.  My whole life.  But I need to ask you this one more favour.  That that person be you.  That you Iove him as if he were your own.  He is my own.  And he has me in his life.  Of course he does.  But more importantly, he has you.  You're decent and good.  I'm not.  You are.  What's her mood? How would I know? I don't know, there's this rumour floating around the two of you are married.  Look, I just need to talk to her about something.  I was wondering if this is a good time.  Just remember she's the boss.  All right.  No.  No further comment.  \"Serial killer murders cop's wife. \" The press won't let up.  They want all the gory details.    So what do you tell them?   Same thing I told you.  It's not our case.  So, what can I do for you? There's, uh, something I think you should know, having to do with Rita.  OK.  And Elliot, the next door neighbour.  I was at the house with Debra  Detective Morgan, cleaning up.  And this Elliot and I struck up conversation.  Turns out he and Rita had like a mini fling.  What's that mean exactly? Well, nothing really happened.  But apparently, Dexter found out about it.  Why are you telling me this? What are you implying? I'm not implying anything.  And what are you doing interviewing witnesses? I wasn't interviewing.  I was there What, cleaning? Please.  Look, if this were anyone but Dexter, we'd at least be thinking like detectives.  Which means what? What do you always say? When the wife is dead, LaGuerta.  Um Hang on for a second.  I need to take this.  We'll finish later.  OK.  Can you repeat that? Yeah.  I just got a call from the FBI about your brother's interview.  Don't tell me.  What'd he say? Nothing.  He didn't show.  So now they're asking for his personnel files.  God damn it.  I knew I should have gone with him.  Morgan? I so did not fucking need this.  Yeah, you and me both.  I'm headed home now.  I'll figure out what happened, and I'll get him down there.  OK.  Dexter? Who the fuck are you? Excuse me? Who the fuck are you? You're the sister, right?   Yeah, I live here.    Well, I'll be leaving, then.  He said you would know what to do.  He said what? Don't go.  Wait.  Dexter Morgan.  Please leave a message at the tone.  Guess who I just met.  The fucking cat lady from downstairs.  She was feeding ice cream to your son.  So, I don't know where the fuck you are or why you think you can fucking run away from the FBI, but you better get back here Fuck! Dexter, where are you? Hope you don't mind I chose that dress.  You were wearing it when we first met.  So I thought since I won't be at the funeral, since I don't deserve to be Kids'll be fine with Deb.  Way better off without me.  I think we agree about that.  I was never really honest with you.  I'm a serial killer.  That's what I am.  I know I led you to believe I'm a human being, but I'm not.  That's a lie.  There are only a few things you really need once you decide to mo\u00ce\u00bde on, what you'll require wherever you land.  A fine suit of clothing the tools of your trade and some token of your past, a reminder of who you really are.  Everything else you just don't need.  So, where are you, Harry? Speak now, or forever hold your peace.  I've disappeared so many people.  My turn now to disappear myself.  Fucking FBI.  Damn it, Dexter, don't do this.  The sea breeze has always brought me clarity.  It's hard to get enough oxygen on land.  It's hard to breathe.  Oh.  Hey, you.  Hey you.  It's Rita.  Yeah, I know.  I was just checking in.  Wanted to see if you were feeling better.  Much better.  Glad to hear that.  The way you left the restaurant so quickly, I don't know, I felt maybe I said something to offend you.  No, you were fine.  Uh, very understanding.  I wasn't completely honest with you.  Um You didn't really get stuck in traffic? I have two kids.  Astor and Cody.  They're nine and seven.  I like kids.  You do? Yeah, they're fun.  Besides, Deb already told me.  And my ex husband and our problems? Did she tell you? Yeah.  So, you know all about me.  I'd like to know more.  So So, maybe we should get together again sometime.  I would like that.  A lot.  A lot.  I know I should hang up right now, but I just need to say it.  I don't know why exactly, but you make me feel good.  Like things could be different.  So do you.  Make me feel that way too, I mean.  Glad I called.  I don't know, I felt up in the air the way things ended.  You know, like we never said a proper goodbye, so Goodbye, Rita Bennett.  Goodbye, Dexter Morgan.  Goodbye.  I'm sorry.  Where's the key to the fucking bathroom? Or should I just dump out on the floor? What's your problem? Nothing.  Fucking retard.  Get the fuck outta here! He's right.  I should keep moving.  Hey.  Hey, hey.  I said what the fuck is your problem? I've had a bad week.  My wife died, and it was my fault.  Well, I'm real sorry for your fuckin' loss, but your dead wife can suck my dick.  I never meant to hurt her.  That's the first human thing I've seen you do since she died, Dexter.  I thought you'd left me.  I'm here.  It's OK, son to show what you're feeling.  They're not better off without you.  You're not better off without them.  You need to go back.  Deb says she's sure he'll be here.  Better be.  If we don't get going soon, we'll be burying Rita by candlelight.  So you're not talking to me now? Is that it? I have been trying to talk to you.  You're right.  You have.  I just need you to understand So, tell me.  I could have fought for this case, but part of me didn't want to.  Rita died.  She died, and it scared me.  We'd been married, what, ten hours? Dexter was the witness at our ceremony.  For all I know, he was there with us while she was   being   I know.  Well, I didn't want to be reminded of that.  I didn't want to investigate.  I just wanted I just wanted it to be our wedding day.  I don't like it, Angel.  I don't like the way this makes me feel.  I don't know what to do with any of it.  Maria.  What? No one does.  What's more important than his own wife's funeral? People are getting restless.  Thank you for reporting in with the obvious, Quinn.  Like I'm such a moron that it's lost on me.  You ever given a eulogy? No.  Well, I can't do it.  And those agents, those vultures, are just waiting for him.  Look, there's something you should probably know.  What? It's not exactly an easy thing to say.  The next door neighbour Elliot, I spoke to him the other day.    What the fuck?   I know I shouldn't have She had a big heart.  Big enough for both of us.  Had to be.  I wasn't even human when we first met.  I never expected that to change.  She reached out and found something I didn't even know was there.  She never hurt anybody.  She was innocent.  And she died a brutal death and and I can't fix it.  But I know I have to try here in Miami with the people who knew her and who who cared about her.  And who loved her.  Like I did.

Uh Kyle Butler.  Something happened to your mom.  She's dead! And it doesn't even matter to you! I wish you were dead! I just got a call from the FBI about your brother's interview.    Don't tell me.  What'd he say?   He didn't show.

That's the first human thing I've seen you do since she died, Dexter.  They're not better off without you.  You're not better off without them.  You need to go back.  It's said there are seven stages of grief.  I suppose killing someone with my bare hands in a men's room was my way of working through the anger stage.  Whatever the other six stages are I don't have time for them.  Cos now I'm a full time dad.  Once the kids and I are back together, it'll all be fine.  I can't believe we're all gonna squish in here.  It's just temporary, till we can get a new place.  Here.  He needs to be hosed off or something.  Hey.  Welcome home.  This isn't our home.  And why do we need a new place, anyway? I think starting in a new apartment will be good for us.  Look, I found a place practically on the beach.  Or another one right next to a park.  But, until then, Astor, you get to share the bed with me.  And, Dex, you're on the couch.  Cody, you're on the cot.  Time for you both to get to bed   school tomorrow.  How can I go to school? I don't even have any of my things.  Make a list.  I'll go by the house tomorrow.  I want to go with you.    I don't think that's a good idea.    Why? Well because of what happened to your mother there.  I know what happened to my mom.  She was murdered.  Don't forget, 9am tomorrow.  FBI interview.  One final loose end to tie up before putting all this behind me.  At the time of your wife's death, you were I already told you.  I was on my boat.  Right.  Just seemed odd.  You do a lot of night boating, Mr Morgan? Sometimes.  It's more peaceful.    And you were by yourself?   Yes, I was alone.  There are security cameras at the marina.  You can see me leaving and returning.  We've seen the footage, Mr Morgan.  The problem is, according to the coroner's report, your wife was killed several hours before you got on the boat.  Is that what this is about? Are you fucking serious? Suggesting I have anything to do with my wife's death that I'd slice her artery, let her bleed out in the bathroom Mr Morgan, we know that you were at Arthur Mitchell's house.  At the time of your wife's death, you were part of the team that raided Arthur Mitchell's house.  Right, of course.  We know you didn't kill your wife.  We're just looking for a reason why Arthur Mitchell might have targeted her.  Because he's a serial killer? How'd it go? Fine.  I'm just glad it's over, and I can move on.  We miss you, brother.  Yeah? How's handling the department all by yourself? Ah, it's a breeze.    I'll be back in a few days.    Oh, no, you won't.  You're taking at least another week.  You need to spend time with your family.  Thanks.  Excuse me.  Anything you need, Dexter, just ask.  I will.  See you tonight.  Oh! Grandparents stopping by too.  They're all staying at your place? Yeah.  It's crowded.  But it's temporary.  He just doesn't want the kids   staying at the house where their mom   Right.  So, we all good here? Yeah, he's airtight.  But otherwise, we got jack shit.  Arthur Mitchell disappeared.  The only lead we have now is this Kyle Butler.  We had a murder victim by that name a few weeks back.  Well, our guy's alive, as far as we know.  Unfortunately, he's disappeared as well.  We're gonna have a sketch artist meet with the family, and get a composite of him.    I'd appreciate it if you'd keep me posted.    Will do.  Hey Maria, your mail.  So, Dexter Morgan, let's get you a moving van.  Aren't you a cute kid, huh?   Huh?   He's not actually talking yet.  Here's your 18 footer.  What's his name?   Harrison.    14 footer.  It's a family name? Blood.  Er Sort of.  So, what kind of stuff you moving? Just, uh, furniture, clothes, a dresser, maybe.  Plenty of reasons for blood to be there.  Someone cut himself mo\u00ce\u00bding If that's all we're talking about, save yourself some money, go with the 10 footer.  I can't let myself think about this.  I've just got to move the kids.  Actually, I think I'll go with the 14 footer.  OK, let's, uh, write you up.  We're gonna get a much better place.  What do you think, closer to the park or the beach? Hello? Dexter? No annoying neighbours.    Hey, Dex.  Brought your mail.    Thanks.  Wow.  Look at Harrison.  Boy, he's just getting bigger every day.  Hey, look, Dex, you know, we haven't had a chance to talk, but I wanted to let you know how sorry I am about everything.  Thanks.    Have they caught the Trinity Killer yet or   No.  Man, if I could just get my hands on him.  I can only imagine.  Hey, listen, I know we've had our differences, but, you know, I'm a single dad.    I know the ropes, so if you need any help   No, I'm good.  Cos you gotta give up a lot.  I mean, I actually had a pretty decent career going, but I had to turn down some major job offers so I could just work at home and just be there for those kids.  Good for you.  I mean, forget about any free time.  Or any life of your own, really.  I mean, you just you have to be there.  Right? Every morning.  Every evening.  Every weekend.  You ready to do that, Dex, for the kids? Yes, Elliot, I'm ready to do that.  For the kids.  Whoa, whoa!   Here, let me   No.  I got it.  But you know what? It works out.  It really does, you know? I mean, you have to give up your life and all, but you know what? You just You live for those kids, and it's satisfying.    Excuse me.    Yeah.  I'll be a good father.  Everyone makes sacrifices.  I can too.  Focus on the kids.  Wow.  I didn't know you were gonna bring so much.  You can just put that   Right there is great.    I emptied the refrigerator.  Someone left another cake at the door.  I just ate a whole tuna casserole to make room in the apartment.  Cody, this is a good job for you.  Wanna help me unload the food? OK.  Wow.  You sure do have a lot of beer, Aunt Deb.  People just keep bringing it.  This is all you brought? Well, we're a little short on space.  You didn't even bring the right clothes.  This is my reject stuff.  I can't wear any of this to school.  Astor, come on.  No one's gonna notice you.  Honey, would you hold the baby?   Come here.    Cody.  Why don't you help us carry the last load in? Hm? I like it here.  It's like camping.  Exactly.  Boys are easier.  It doesn't matter how much I lo\u00ce\u00bde my children, I'm still a creature of the night.  Can't sleep either? The blood probably means nothing.  Someone cut their finger while moving.  But I won't be able to put it out of my mind until I know for sure.  Someone did a quick cleanup job but forgot to wash the door.  Yeah, it's pretty.  I know.  But not the story it tells.  Once upon a time, an evil green ogre left a circular spatter at three feet high, consistent with blunt force trauma which seems to indicate the handsome young prince was hit while on his knees, at least two or three times.  Or the princess was on her knees.  Small hands.  Female.  I thought the kids were your number one responsibility.    They are.    But here you are in the middle of the night.  It's not that simple.  It never is.  It's like when you get on a plane.  They tell you if the oxygen masks come down to put yours on first before helping the kids.  I have to take care of my own needs too.  Otherwise, I risk spinning out of control.  And that's not good for anyone.  I'm not just saying this for the sake of the kids, Dex, but for you.  They're not only your responsibility.  They're your salvation.  I have to give him a bottle.  No reason a truck rental agency would put any serious safeguards on their records.  The truck was most recently rented to Boyd Fowler.  Boyd seems to have listed his address as the Department of Sanitation.  No home address.  Miami Dade County Department of Sanitation, Division of Dead Animal Pickup, meaning the blood belongs to an animal.  But what about those little handprints? Two lines.  Human.  Well, well, well.  What do we got here? Raccoon.    You call this in?   Yeah, I did.  I was driving down the road, and I saw it.  Kind of creeps me out.  You're probably used to seeing dead things, though, huh? Can't say I ever get used to it.  I don't usually come this way, but I'm in the middle of moving to a new place.  It's a hassle, huh? Moving?   I wouldn't know.    No? Lived in the same house for over 20 years.  So why did you rent a moving van? Hello there, bandit.    This don't look right.    What do you mean? Usually, you find a dead animal in the road, it means he was hit by a car.  But there's no tyre marks or blood on the asphalt.  This raccoon was killed someplace else and dropped here.  He's CSl ing me.  He's got defensive wounds on his paws.  Little guy put up quite a struggle.  All righty, then.  He's definitely peculiar.  But I guess the best and brightest don't typically get into dead animal pickup.  Just so you know, OK? What do we got? We got a female victim.    Part of a female victim.    Part?   We got a head.    Just a head? Yeah.  Decapitation.  Probably some kind of drug killing.  Nice.  Let me ask you a question, hypothetical.    Say a newly married person   Mm hm? accidentally discovers that his or her new spouse has a savings account with a lot of money.  Is that something that one should expect to share? Fuck, no.  That's your money.  You tell the lieutenant to keep her fuckin' hands off it.    Take me to the head.    All right.  She was still alive when they cut her head off.  Excision of eyes and tongue was done postmortem.  That's considerate of them.  You were right.  It's just a head.  Unless they buried her standing up.  What are you doing? Just trying to help.  You're looking a little ragged.  I'm exhausted.  There are five people in my tiny apartment.  I shared a bed with Astor last night, and she kicked me all night long.  You know, you're welcome to crash at my place, if you want.  No, thanks, Detective.  OK.  It looks like Santa Muerte.  What? Santa Muerte, the cult.  \"Saint Death. \" Yeah, I know what it is, but why do you say that? Well, the missing eyes and tongue were meant to send a message.  You didn't see anything, you're not gonna say anything.  Who are you? Officer Manzon, Cira.  The golden candles mean money.  The icons, I don't know.  There are so many now, you might need an expert on it.    And you know all this because   It's my neighbourhood.  And if it is Santa Muerte, they used a machete on her.  OK, well, we'll keep that in mind.  But this park is a local drug hangout, and drug cartels like to cut heads off,   so we might follow that lead.    Of course.  Hey.  We found the body on the other end of the park, under some bushes, no ID.  Gotta canvass the neighbourhood, start asking questions.  No one will talk.  They're too afraid.  Well, we still ask, Officer.  \"Helping Your Children Cope With Grief. \" \"Grandpa's Gone To Heaven. \" \"Saying Goodbye To Fluffy. \" But nothing on \"Mommy bled out in a bathtub. \" Boyd Fowler, you have a prison record.  Assault with a deadly weapon.  You said you lived in a house, but there are no mortgage records in your name.  In the same house for over 20 years.  You inherited it from your parents Rich and Elsie Fowler in Opa Locka.  Hey.  How was your day? A whole afternoon getting doors shut in my face.  Sorry.  You? OK.  We finished LaGuerta's cacerola de camarones and Masuka's chocolate lava cake, and Astor told me she hated living here.  They're both asleep in the bed.  Looking at apartments.  So it's everything as usual.  They're seeing their grief counsellor tomorrow.  Maybe that'll help.    Still, even after   What? You're gonna be a single dad raising three kids.  Gonna be hard.  Rita was a great mom.  There's nothing I can do to make up for that.  But I'm gonna have to try.  Well, I'll be here.  You can count on me.  The kids'll be OK.  I know that place.  It's near the station.  They have an open house tomorrow.  Maybe I'll check it out for you.  Great.  You want the couch tonight? No, you take it.    Hey.    Hi.  Glad you called.    Hey, fuck puddle.  What are you doing?   Just giving you a kiss hello.  I came over here to sleep, not to have your fat little sausage fingers all over me.  There's no room for me at my own place.  Unless I want to curl up inside a fuckin' toaster oven.  I'm trying so hard to be a good sister.  Fuck knows, Dexter's always been the best brother, but it is fucking exhausting.  I'm sure.  Well, look you're, uh, welcome to stay here for as long as you want, whenever you want.  And I promise to keep my fat little sausage fingers off you.  You better.    How's your brother?   You know.  I heard the FBI interview went well.  That must be a load off.  Why would that be a load off? Nothing.  Never mind.  They're looking for someone named Kyle Butler who's a friend of Arthur Mitchell's.  They think if they can find him, then he can lead them to Mitchell.    But they can't find him?   Well, not yet.  They're having sketches done.  They're trying to get a positive ID.  Kyle Butler.  Why does that name sound so familiar? Well, that's the weird thing.  We worked that case, remember? A dead Kyle Butler.  Right, he got his head smashed in.  Went unsolved.    Any connection?   I don't know.  I'm sure the FBI will find a way to fuck it up.  Will you get the lights? Yes, ma'am.  What do you want to do for the next batch? Mickey Mouse? Silver dollar?   Great big ones?   Triangles.  A challenge.  Dexter's making triangle pancakes.  Actually, they're more freeform.    Wanna set the table for us?   Sure.  They're just blobs.  How dare you? Triangles.  I counted too many plates.  Mom's not here.    That's OK.    No, it's not.    She should be here.    I'm sorry.    That doesn't make a difference.    Astor, I'm doing the best I can here.  Let's just sit down and have some breakfast.  I don't want to!   I wanna go back home!   Astor   Stop it!   Yeah, just stop it! Both of you, just stop fighting all the time! I hate it! While they're seeing the grief counsellor, I'll be getting my own kind of therapy.  So, is this, uh something we should talk about? Whatever's going on between us?   No.    We have sex one day, and then I'm sorry, I'm not the kind of person who would ever have sex with you.    I don't know what we're doing.    We're not doing anything.  We never did do anything.  We never will do anything.    So we never had sex?   Exactly.  That's really weird.  Cos I remember I gotta go now.  I'm gonna go.    How's it going?   I hate this shit.  This is Dexter's job.  Blood.  It's gross.  Well, whoever cut the head off used the same weapon to cut the eyes and the tongue out.  But I can't find anything that fits.  I've tried two swords, three knives.  Try the machete.  Yeah.  Huh! I think we have a match.  I'll send somebody over there right away.  OK, yeah.  How's it going in there? Masuka said he really likes working with the blood.  He hopes he can get more assignments like this.  I'll keep that in mind.  Let me ask you a question.  If you were married, and you found out that the person you were married to had a secret bank account with a lot of money, do you think that person should share it? Jesus, Angel.  Just because you married her doesn't mean you own her.  It's her money.  End of story.  Well, you got a dead body waiting for you.  Oh! Fuck me.  Why couldn't he have just hanged himself, took some pills, stuck his head in the oven? People are so rude.  Excuse me.    You again.    It's my neighbourhood.  You were right about the machete.  Good, I guess.    So, what do we have here?   Well, golly gee, Deb, I think we got a shotgun wound to the head.  Approximately 24 hours ago.  Make sure you swab the gun.    And check his hands for GSR.    I got it, I got it.  I'm just checking.  Dexter usually works cases like this.  Do we have an ID? According to this, Francisco Alfaro.  Hey, can we roll him over? Oh! Looks like his face has changed a little since his driver's licence picture was taken.  Looks like him.    Hey check out the girl.    What? Look at her.  Imagine she has no eyes and no tongue.    Holy shit.    It's her, isn't it? Those are the exact same earrings.  We've got our head.  Bingo.  Looks like we've got a murder suicide here.    How you figure?   Guy gets pissed at his wife, cuts her head off, leaves it in the park for everyone to see and comes home, blows his head off.  Masuka, we've got some brain goo on the ceiling you need to photograph.  Fuck me up the goat ass.  What about all that Santa Muerte stuff, then? Yeah.  There is no Santa Muerte stuff.  That's what I'm saying.  There was at the park.  There was missing eyes and a tongue and the gold candles and the icons.    There's none of that here.    No.  What do you think?   I think you're right.    Who's she? Hey when is Dexter coming back? Boyd Fowler works the seven to four shift, which gives me time to check out his house, see if there's anything that'll put him on my table.  Let me guess.  This is you putting on your oxygen mask first.  Being on the hunt keeps me sharp.  Focused.  Thus, the better killer I am, the better father.  So he takes his work home with him.  No crime in that.  A man of simple taste.  Looks like my grandmother's house.  A loaded handgun.  A no no for a convicted felon.  But even so, not much to go on.  Boyd, you are very boring.  Shit.  Boyd comes home for lunch.  OK, that's interesting.  Do you want to have control of your life? You have that power.  You just have to learn how to use it.  You can make up all the excuses you want.  You're too tired.  Who keeps their attic door locked? Too old.  Too fat.  Too stupid.  You know, I've heard them all.  Chicken noodle, chicken noodle, chicken noodle.  Where's the tomato?   But if you want something, take it!   Take it! You want that job?   Well, then, take it!   Well, then, take it! It's entirely up to you.  The world does not You want that nice house on the beach?   Take it!   Take it! The world does not put limitations on what you can have.  But if you want something   Take it!   Take it! You have that power.  I can see having an old girlfriend's lock of hair but identified only by a number? We are our own worst enemy.  Make no mistake about it.  But with a few simple steps, I can teach you how to take control of your life.  Take it! All I'm saying if a woman pissed me off enough, yeah, I'd wanna cut her head off.  Well, that's great to hear.  No, I'm not saying I would do it.  But I understand the impulse.  What are we doing here? I told Dexter I'd check this place out for him.  Oh! Come in, come in.    Hey.    Hi! We've just painted and installed new flooring throughout the house.    Looks great.    Ooh! Lots of young couples in the neighbourhood.  And the elementary school is about three blocks away.  I'm sure you'd be very happy here.    Oh, it's not for us, we   I think we'd be very happy here too.  Thank you.  Well, I have to get a few things out of my car.  But if you have any questions, I'll just be right outside.  Thank you.    It's a nice kitchen.    Uh huh.    Decent appliances.    Uh huh! Oh, look at this.  Great bedroom.  Check it out.  Don't.  Oh! Wow.  Comfy bed.  Feel it.    Get off the bed.    What do you say? A little nap time?   I'm leaving.    What did I do? I've got to drop you off at the station, then pick up my brother's kids.  How desperate am I, to follow Boyd to the middle of nowhere when all I've got is a bit of blood and a lock of hair? But with nothing else to go on It's a rule of nature.  Leave some old bedsprings out in the middle of nowhere, and soon it'll be joined by a refrigerator, couch, car engine.  And now, a barrel, most likely holding dead animals.  Too lazy to drive it back to the incinerator, I suppose.    Hey, Deb.    Do you have the kids? Harrison's with Bill and Maura and Astor and Cody are with you?   Shit!   What's going on? Did you drop them off at school this morning? Yeah, they were seeing the counsellor first, then going to their regular classes.  I just went to pick them up, and the woman said that they never went to class.  So I called the apartment, and there's no answer.  Well, where are they? That's my question, big brother.  Where would they go? Same place Astor keeps saying she wants to go.  Astor.  Cody.  Hey.  How'd you guys get here? We walked.  Don't be mad, Dexter.  They wanted to see where it happened.  Where they lost their mother.  I'm not mad.  Astor, I'm sorry.  I should have listened to you.  I should have brought you back here, like you asked.  If you want to move back here, we will.  We'll find a way to make it work.  No, we won't.  Astor, I'm sorry.  You keep saying that, but I don't care.  You ruined everything.  We'd gotten used to it.  It wasn't that bad!   Used to what?   To the way things were! Before you! Without a dad! Oh.  And then you come along and become a part of the family, and we thought that everything was gonna be good forever.  You made us think that! And it's not true.  Things got worse.  Now, every time I look at you I get so angry, because it was all just a lie! It's not Dexter's fault.  I thought coming here would help.  But that was stupid.  No, I understand.  It looks exactly the same as before.  Yeah, it does.  You can't even tell what happened.  But I know my mom died there.  And things will never be the same.    I miss her so much.    I do too.  We all do.  I don't want to live with you.  I want to live with Grandma and Grandpa.  I want to go back with them tonight.  Right now! Hey.  I'm heading out.  You want to grab a bite somewhere? No.  Why would I wanna do that? All right.  Hey, Lieutenant.  Deb told me about the Kyle Butler sketches.  Yeah, well, I'm not sure how useful they'll be.  The mother and two children all gave very different versions.  It's their biggest lead.  Seems to be going nowhere.  Do you mind if I keep a copy of these? No, I got plenty.  Angel.  Let me ask you a question.  Can you tell me why you kept this much money a secret from me? It was never a secret.  That's my retirement fund.  Now that we're married, aren't we supposed to share everything? I don't think we ever discussed that.  Maybe we have different ideas about what a marriage should be.  Because I always pictured you and I at 80 years old, walking down the beach, hand in hand.  I like to picture that as well, Angel.  I love you.  But I think maybe I have more of a   practical side than you do.    What does that mean? I mean I've worked my entire career to save up, to protect myself, and you live every day like it's a party.  It's one of the things I like about you, but it also means that you spend money faster than you even make it.    OK.    And it's, I'm OK, I get it.  I don't mean to hurt your feelings.  No, I'm fine.  I'm irresponsible.    Oh, Maria.    Everyone knows that.  Hey, everyone! Drinks on me.  Tonight.  Yeah! Angel.  Hey.  So, everyone's home safe? Yeah, they're all inside.  You think they're finally settling in? They're packing.    What do you mean?   Astor and Cody are leaving.  Soon as their grandparents get here, they're going back to Orlando with them.  Dex, I'm so sorry.  For how long? I don't know.    Well, maybe if I talk to Astor   I already tried.    And Cody wants to go too?   No, he wants to stay.  It got very upsetting.  What did you say? I reminded him that you and I are brother and sister, just like him and Astor, and that it's important that they never split up.  All the shit we've been through.  I never would have made it through without you.  That's what I tried to tell him.  Did it help? Not really.  I really was trying to make it work.    In my own way.    Yeah, I know you were.  I guess it's time to face reality.  Reality.    Quinn.    OK, we had sex.  Was it good sex? I've said all I'm gonna say.  Are we gonna have more sex?   Goodbye.    Come on.  Help me out here.  I'm hanging up now.  If she wants to live her life stashing away all her little pennies, that's her problem.  I can't do anything about that.  You know?   You want another drink?   You buying, right? Bartender, a Cuervo silver.  You know how much money she's got? It's sick.  Did she tell me? Did she tell me? Cheers.  Angel.  It true you married Maria LaGuerta? I did indeed.  You got yourself a little sugar mama.    What?   Oh, yeah.  I remember when she was first starting out.  Such a fine piece of ass.  I think you need to get the hell out of here.  You fuck! If they need anything, just let me know.  I'll send it.  We will.  Thank you.  I lost my innocence at such an early age, and it left a very damaging mark.  Can't I stay with you, Dexter? For now, you need to go with your grandparents.  Don't worry, we'll still see each other all the time.  Orlando's not so far.  Yes, it is.  Any shrink could tell you that's why I've always liked children.  Because they connect me to what I can never get back.  I don't want to go, Dexter.  I don't want you to go.  Astor What? Your mother loved you more than you could ever imagine.  And I Me too.  Cody and Astor showed me that I can still care about something.  That makes letting them go all that much harder.  And it's losing them that makes me realise there must be some small part of that innocent child still inside me.  Because, just like Astor, I was foolish enough to think that things would always be good.  But they're not.  They're worse.  Much worse.  Normally, having a target would make me feel good, give me direction, a sense of purpose.  But now it means nothing.  And I don't know what's going to make me feel better.  Should we go home? Give me a minute.      Previous EpisodeNext Episode"

I don't want to live with you.  I want to live with Grandma and Grandpa.  FBI? Fucking Bunch of Idiots.  We know you didn't kill your wife.  We're just looking for a reason why Arthur Mitchell might have targeted her.  We all good here? The only lead we have now is this Kyle Butler.  It looks like Santa Muerte, the cult.    Who are you?   Officer Manzon, Cira.  We have sex one day, and then I'm sorry, I'm not the kind of person who would ever have sex with you.    OK, we had sex.    Was it good sex? I've said all I'm gonna say.  You're welcome to stay here for as long as you want, whenever you want.  I heard the FBI interview went well.  They're looking for someone named Kyle Butler.  He's a friend of Arthur Mitchell's.  They're having sketches done.  The Mitchell family all gave very different versions.  Do you mind if I keep a copy of these? You married Maria LaGuerta? Such a fine piece of ass.  You fuck! Boyd Fowler.  You're probably used to seeing dead things though, huh? Can't say I ever get used to it.  You want that nice house on the beach.  Take it! I can see having an old girlfriend's lock of hair but identified by only a number? I'm just trying to get to the truth.  However long that takes is up to you.  I'm telling you the truth.  I'm not lying.  First you said you didn't do drugs, and then you said you did.  I said I might have tried some at a Tri Delt party once.  You might have? What the fuck does that even mean? You did or you didn't.  You can't kind of do blow.  But that was six years ago in college.  And I'm supposed to believe you're not on anything now?   I'm totally clean.    Then why are you so nervous? Because I wasn't expecting on getting these kinds of questions.  I mean, you sound like a cop.  I am a cop.  I work for Miami Metro Homicide.  Look, I don't know what's going on here.  I came for a nanny job.  I'm not, like, planning to kill the president.  Harrison needs a nanny and Deb insisted on running point.  The way it's going, only Mary Poppins would make the cut.  I don't care what doctors say.  I think it's important for children to eat a lot of cheese.  Well, if a child's choking, I just do what my mama always did.  You get ahold of it by the legs and you give it a little knuckle slap.  No, I've never had martial arts training, but I can scream real loud.  I have a nursing degree with an emphasis on infant toddler growth and development.  Why not work at a hospital? Well, I did, but there were budget cuts, and my ward was downsized.  I live alone.  I don't need a big salary.  So a nanny position would work very well for me.  He's tired.  May I?   I don't bite.    OK.  Hi.  Oh.  What a little prince you are.  Mmm.   Bye, baby Bunting  Daddy's gone a hunting  Gone to find a rabbit skin  To wrap the baby Bunting in  And then there was Sonya.  Practically perfect in every way.  Well, you have my number.  I'll look forward to your call.  Again, my condolences for your loss.  Thanks.  We'll be in touch.  Bye, prince Harry.  She's the one.  Are you sure you don't want to keep looking, Dex? I just don't want to lose her.  Prince Harry likes her.    Ditto me.    Then call her.  Don't forget, you and Harrison Crisis counsellor.  I won't forget.  Love you, bro.  Me too.  Emptiness wasn't always a problem.  I used to cherish it.  But now it feels like something to overcome.  Emptiness is all she has left.  Boyd Fowler.  Department of Sanitation.  Division of Dead Animal Pickup.  Hobbies   self impro\u00ce\u00bdement and storing women in formaldehyde.  I don't know if killing you will fill the void, but it's a place to start.    What's this?   ATM surveillance video.  The bank sent it over.  This is our shotgun guy.    Francisco Alfaro?   Yeah.  It's what he looked like when he had a face.  When was this taken? Two hours before he killed his wife and blew his own head off.  Trying to get cash, but he keeps putting in the wrong PIN number.    0371.  His wife's birthday.    Ouch.  Good thing she's dead.  He never would have lived that down.  What the hell happened to you guys? Battle scars.  We had to get ghetto on some dirt bag at the club last night.    You guys got in a bar fight?   It's not worth talking about.  True warriors are humble men.  Oh, please.  You got a reason to be humble.  You got fucked up running the other way.  You're confusing cowardice with a tactical retreat.  Hermano, back me up here.  You backed up just fine on your own.  OK, let's focus on the case, people.    Remember why we're getting paid.    OK.  I'll go first.  Guy offs his wife, wants to skip the country.  Needs cash, but he's so wigged out, he can't remember the PIN.  Gives up, goes home, kills himself.  Only problem with that theory is Alfaro doesn't have a motive to kill his wife.    Maybe he's just sick of her.    Oh, yeah, he got sick of her? Got sick of her, so he cut off her head and put it in a park and put candles all around it? Yeah.  Have you watched the video? Cos he's a little fucking crazy.  Crazy does not explain why he doesn't have a drop of blood on his clothes.  Why don't you think about that for a second? How do you cut somebody's head off and not get a drop of blood on you? What'd he do? Wear a bib? As much fun as this is, we're not gonna hash this out in the room.  I would like to re canvass the neighbourhood where Mrs Alfaro's body was found.  There are a lot of houses facing that park.  Somebody's bound to talk.    Start today.    And I think Batista should be there.  Hispanic neighbourhood.  Hispanic cop.  Might raise the comfort level, loosen tongues.  I get it.  OK.  The rest of you, stay with the case.  Work your leads.    Thanks.    Beautiful.  Angel? Just how big was this fight? Like I told you this morning, it was a disagreement that got out of hand.  Too much booze.  Too much testosterone.  Esp\u00c3\u00a9rate.  Uh You punched another cop.  I mean, qu\u00c3\u00a9 pas\u00c3\u00b3?   What started it?   We hashed it out.  Hombre a hombre.  It's settled.  Pretty sure his appetite's about the same.  He's always been kind of a messy eater.  It's hard to tell.    His sleeping pattern?   Same.  Unfortunately, he cries about three times a night, on a good night.  So you're not surprised that he's acting pretty much normal? No.  You and Harrison suffered a terrible tragedy.  It's no getting around that, but there is something to be thankful for.    Thankful?   Yes.  Harrison's cognitive abilities are really just developing.  So you're saying he might not be affected by what he saw? There's just simply no chance that he was able to comprehend what was happening.  I saw something pretty traumatic when I was three.  Harrison's only ten months.  It affected me a lot.  You don't have any idea.  I've seen a lot of children.  We'll keep an eye on Harrison, but I really think your son is gonna be perfectly fine.  Ooh.  He wants his head back.  Ahh.  Children Harrison's age can exhibit what might seem like violent behaviour, but they're just releasing energy.  It's important not to read into it.  I'll try not to.  The most important thing you can do right now, is take care of yourself.  Find some time to release your own energy.  Do something for Dexter.  Dexter will.  I have nothing to say.  I didn't see no one.  Well, if you remember anything, or if you hear anything Yes, mm hm.  I call you.  C\u00c3\u00b3rrele, mi hija.  We're never gonna hear from her.  All this no talking is fucking frustrating.  Yeah.  You know what's frustrating? Nine days, 13 hours.    What?   Since we, you know?   Just   You're counting? I can't help it.  I have an internal clock.  Well, unplug it.  I'm just saying, at this point, we might as well be married.  Shit on my face.  You ever use words like \"we\" and \"married\" in the same fucking sentence again Another case of temporary blindness.  Anything? These people are all afraid of something.  Yeah, I'm getting that too.  Maybe they just don't want to get involved.  No, I think it's more than that.  If the killer's dead, what are they afraid of? I thought I could make some headway, but the reality is, this is a Venezuelan neighbourhood.    So?   I'm Cuban.    Officer Manzon's from this neighbourhood.    Manzon? She's a uniform, but she might be worth bringing in.  She thinks these are about religious murders.  \"Santa Mierda. \" Ha! That's Santa Muerte.  It's \"Saint Death\", not \"Saint Shit\".  And Manzon might be onto something.  Might explain why no one's talking.  Shut up.    Hello?   Hi, it's Dexter.  Hi.  Yeah, I don't know if I mentioned, but for his nap, Harrison likes the puppy blanket just touching his face.  It's on your checklist.  Uh, item eight under \"sleep preferences\".  OK, good.  How's he doing? We just read The Very Hungry Caterpillar, for the seventh time.  Don't worry.  He usually gets sick of it around the 20th read.  I gotta go.  Yeah, you call me if there's anything.  Thought he'd never spot me.  Some coinkidink, huh? You find any more dead animals? Looks like you're working on something.  Tastes a lot better than it looks.  Have a seat.    Boyd Fowler.    Daryl Tucker.  You work around here? I just love the arabica.  Actually, I'm between jobs.  Hence the want ads.    What kind of work you looking for?   Oh, not choosy.  Whatever pays and gets me out of the house.    You like what you do?   I love it.  Probably wouldn't think so, driving around, picking up dead animals.  Ah, beats working in a cubicle.  You get out in the fresh air.  Well, I guess most of the time it's fresh.  It's not boring.  Never know what's around the next bend.  Full of surprises.  You know If you're interested, we might have an opening at animal pickup.    Really?   Yeah, there ain't exactly a line either.  You should take a ride with me.  See if you like it.  You got to be OK around dead things though.  I don't think that's a problem.  Great.  Tomorrow morning, eight sharp.  I would have settled for your work schedule, but this could be better.  Only 24 hours to get ready.  Boyd's patrol route.  Need to find a place where we can spend some quality time.  There.  An old tourist welcome centre.  Not very welcoming now.  Totally isolated.  Thank you, City of Miami.  You're gonna kill him in daylight? Doesn't matter out this far.  It's still very risky.  What if someone comes by? That could also happen at night.  But it's a lot less likely.  You have to do this right, Dexter.  It's important.  It's your first kill since You don't have to tell me how much I need this.  That's the problem.  What? This kill won't put everything right.  It won't bring Rita back.  It might bring me back.  If you make it mean so much, you'll only invite mistakes.  I won't make any mistakes.  I'm following the code.  Are you gonna help me or not? I only want to help you, Dex.  This is a big room.  I hope you brought enough plastic.  It feels good getting the details right.  It's more than just preparing a kill room.  It's like I'm putting my life back in order.  And it's almost enough.  Almost.  If anyone knows about these murders, it's Fauzi.  He knows everybody in this neighbourhood.  You really grew up around here? You make it sound like a disability.  I'm asking a question.  I'm not about to burn a cross.  I used to ride my bike around this block.  There was this mean dog that lived there.  I mean, I used to pray to Saint Anthony to make me invisible.  I never got bit.  You think prayer was the reason? Yeah.  That and some homemade pepper spray.  \u00c2\u00bfPodemos hablar con Fauzi? \u00c2\u00bfPor qu\u00c3\u00a9 raz\u00c3\u00b3n? Polic\u00c3\u00ada.  Es importante.  Por favor.  Un momento.  I was surprised you called.  Thought you didn't believe what I said at the crime scene.  Who says I do? At this point, I can't rule anything out.  Well, bringing me in was the best move, Detective.  You won't be sorry.  Me llamo Manzon.  Es el Detective Morgan.  Ask him if he's heard of the deaths of Mr and Mrs Alfaro.  S\u00c3\u00ad.  Qu\u00c3\u00a9 cosa tan terrible.  This was found at the crime scene.  Did he sell it to Mr Alfaro? He says Alfaro was a strict Catholic.  Came into the store now and then to buy some things, but he wouldn't have been caught dead back here.  Did he sell it to anyone else? He says he doesn't keep track of who buys what, and he doesn't even believe in this shit.  Is that why he has the tattoo? I got drunk one night, woke up, it was there.  You tell me.    \u00c2\u00bfTe llamas Manzon?   S\u00c3\u00ad.  Cira.  Ah, co\u00c3\u00b1o.  Eres la hija de Andr\u00c3\u00a9s.  Hey, hey.  We're doing great in English.  You live in Miami.  Why you no learn Spanish? Because me too busy making a living.  Is there anything else you can tell us? Anything that will help us with this case? Yo no s\u00c3\u00a9 nada.  Fauzi's holding back.  I should have talked to him by myself.  Might have been in a more sharing mood with someone he knows.  Oh, yeah? Maybe he would have said nothing, like everyone else in this neighbourhood.  Hey, I know you're up against it, but you might just want to take a breath.  Why don't we give him the night to stew over this and then you come visit him tomorrow alone? Fine.  Sonya? Where are they? Hi, this is Sonya.  Leave a message.  Yeah, it's Dexter.  I just got back and you're not here, and not answering your cell.  Call me now.  Can't help but think the worst.  Harrison's been stolen.  I shouldn't have left him with a stranger.  Rita would have never allowed it.  Hi.  Finally fallen asleep.  Where were you? Well, he was keyed up after his Yo Gabba Gabba! Videos.  I thought some fresh air would make him drowsy.  It worked.    You didn't answer your cell.    Well, I had my hands full.  Oh, I left a note on the fridge.  Oh, I didn't mean to worry you.  No, it's fine.  I'm just I'm not used to checking the fridge for notes.  Just messages from other serial killers.    Oh, I feel terrible.    Don't.  You were just doing your job.  Hey, I'm lucky to have you.  We both are.  Oh! A little courtesy, please.  Thanks.  You hitting the club tonight? No.  Home.  Oh, good.  Cos I won't be there to watch your back.  There could be wingmen out there looking to settle the score.  Just drop it.  With all due respect, this man is a knight in shining armour.  You should be polishing his lance.  Excuse me? I meant that metaphorically.  Not how it sounded.  Good night.  OK, I want to know exactly what happened at the bar.  I told you it's settled, tesoro.  I'm not asking as your wife.  Vince and I were having drinks, keeping to ourselves.  And then out of the blue, Sergeant Lopez starts talking shit.    What shit?   You know shit.    He was out of line.    Specifics.  He asked if you and I were married.  Then he said you were a fine piece of ass.    And you were my sugar mama.    Sugar mama? Yeah, cos you're my boss and your paycheck has more zeros.    Does that really bother you?   A little.  Do you know any guys it wouldn't bother?   So you hit him?   No, there's more.    More?   You wanted to know everything.  He then said you gave the best blowjobs in Miami.  And then I hit him.  And he's lucky that's all I did.  Angel, I'm a woman in a position of power.  Some men have trouble dealing with that,   so they spread garbage around.    I know.  I know.  And I'm trying to work through it.  Could you work through it without the bar fights? I'll keep the bar fights at a minimum.  He sleeping? Like a baby.  How was work? Dire.  I've been saddled with this uniform on a homicide case, and she's driving me ape ass crazy.    How's the nanny?   Aside from a little message hiccup It was totally my fault.  She did great.  I wonder why she left Ireland.    Maybe she's running from something.    I don't know, Deb.  Maybe you better check Interpol.  What about you? What'd you do today? Not much.  Cody called.  He wanted me to send my recipe for pancakes.  How are they? Cody sounds happier.  Astor wouldn't come to the phone.  She'll come around, Dex.  Well, other than that, I ran some errands.  That's good.  Get back in your routine.  When you lose someone close, routine can be a ladder that can help you climb back into some kind of normalcy.    Where'd you hear that?   I am capable of independent thought.  Oprah.  I watched her when I was laid up.  That's good.  Keep getting better, Dex.  I'll try.  Yeah, I'd like to report a dead animal.  Uh, County Road five, mile marker 31.  I'm not sure.  I think it was a gator.  It was long and scaly.  Yeah.  Thank you.  It's on Boyd's circuit, so he'll get the call.  When he does, Boyd will take a little nap and wake up in the tourist welcome centre.  But he won't be collecting any brochures.  Wasn't sure you'd be here.  Wouldn't miss it for the world.  Hey, I'm a safety guy.  Right.  Never be too safe.    Where we off to first?   Dead cat on Lindgren.  Boring.  Pretty neighbourhood though.  Lot of trophy wives out jogging at this hour.  There's a bonus.  You have to embrace the now.  Every second you waste is one more second you'll never get back.  Ever hear this guy? When I was searching your house.  Changed my life.  Really helped me see what's important.  Do the same for you.  Ease you through that divorce.  Divorce? Ring dent.  I didn't want Boyd to know that part of my life.  For a roadkill janitor, he doesn't miss much.  Hope it's not a touchy subject.  No, it just didn't work out.  If you need help moving on, listen to these CDs.  Take it.  Take it now.  That's the main idea.    Take it now?   There's more to it than that, but it really makes a difference.  Of course, you got to know what it is you want to take.  What is it you want, Daryl? That's kind of a hard question to answer.  Yes, it is.  But I really think it's what we're on this earth to find out.  Justin Bieber.  Not that I know who that is.  I know who purchased the Santa Muerte icons, and it wasn't our dead husband.    Fauzi talked?   I was right.  He was holding back.    What'd you get?   No names, but a description.  Two guys in their 30s, strong accents, possibly recent immigrants from Venezuela.  Criminal types.  Those were his words.  And big into Santa Muerte.  What if Alfaro isn't freaked out because he just murdered his wife? What if he's freaked out because someone's got his wife? And they'll kill her unless he pays cash.  This isn't drug related.  Maybe she was fucking held hostage for ransom.  You think Fauzi spilled everything he knows? He's been asking around.  Thinks he can dig up some more.  Well, let's fucking find out.  Sometimes it gets so hot, these things actually start frying.  And you got to you got to scrape 'em off like diner food.  Two hours and no call about my gator.  They must have sent someone else.  God almighty.  That stink gets in your soul.  Which means this kill is dead.  Man, you got a nose of steel.  You're made for this job.  Now I'm stuck with Boyd.  So much for getting my life back.  It's almost lunch time.  I usually eat at home by myself, but there's a Chinese place not too far.  Hang on.  Boyd.  Maybe the universe is showing mercy on me.  What's the location?   I'm on it.    What's up? Dead gator out on County five.  First promising thing all day.  But if you're starving, we can push it till after lunch.    I'm good.    Then let's rumble.  Gator runs can be hairy.  You got to be on your toes.    Hairy how?   Can't always tell if they're really dead.    Yikes.    Don't worry.  Like I said I'm a safety guy.  Must be at lunch.  Hello? Shit.  Detective.  Call it in.  Do it.  This is Officer Manzon.  Mile marker should be right around here.  Be careful.  Sucker could be anywhere.  You really don't want to step on it.  Finally it's right.  Shit.  Where am I? On your way to County Medical.    You know what city you're in?   Miami.  What day is it? Wednesday.  What happened to me? A motorist spotted you lying on the side of the road, called 911.  Seems this guy shot you with a tranq dart.  Boys have an argument or something? No.  No.  Went off by accident.  Crazy asshole, you were supposed to shoot the gator.  You got in my way, you fucking numbskull.  So what's your excuse? Why were you unconscious? They must not have found my needle.  I guess I was just so upset that I passed out.  There's one piece of good luck.  I really need to get back to my truck.  Yeah, sorry.  I can't let you jump out of a moving ambulance.  We'll be there soon.  Need to get you both checked over.  Got him.  Dropping it.  Let's go.  Let's go on three.  Trauma two.  Chart.  I'm Dr Lorre.  I understand you suffered a loss of consciousness.    That's what I'm told.    That ever happen before? Um First time.  You have any history of headaches, dizziness,   blurred vision?   Uh uh.    Hypoglycaemia?   Not that I know of.  OK.  We're gonna run a chem profile and check your glucose levels for possible dehydration.  We'll follow up with a tox screen.  See if anything's in your system.  I'll be right back to draw your blood.  Just lie still.  He's in there, OK.  Just give him aspirin.  No painkillers.  I'm sorry, Doctor.  I didn't know about his addiction.  Well, you got to check the patient's records here, he's Fifth time he's been in the ER this year.  This is his fifth accident.    It won't happen again.    All right.  Another head? And I was in such a good mood.  It's my fault.  I got him killed.  Fuck that.  You didn't cut his head off.  They did this because he started talking to me.  If I hadn't come back here, Fauzi would still be alive.  It was my call.  We're in this together.  And we're closer to catching him because of you, OK? You did good.  Looks like the same treatment as our other head case.  Eyes and tongue have been excised.  Damn, don't people just shoot each other any more? Excuse me a sec.  Hey, thanks for calling me back.  No prob.  Sorry it took so long.  We're up to our necks on this Trinity thing.  Yeah, that's what I want to talk to you about.  I think I may have a lead on Kyle Butler.  Kyle Butler? Yeah, you know, the guy who was hanging around with Arthur Mitchell? Yeah, I know who he is.  Just didn't know you people were working this.  I'm sort of, uh flying off the record.  Listen.  Is there any chance I could talk to the Mitchell family? The Mitchells are in a safe house.  First stop before witness protection.  Just want to show them a photo.  Take five minutes.  Give me the photo.  I'll show it to them.  Ah, it's too sensitive.  If I'm wrong, it could mean my ass.  Come on Ray, as a friend.    I'll see what I can do, but no promises.    Thanks.  Let me know.  Take it.    Now, before you can take anything   What the fuck? you have to know what it is you want.  May sound easy, but you can't know what you want unless you know yourself.  But if you want something, there's only one option.  Take it.  You want that promotion? Well, then, take it.  You want that new car, that house? Take it.  That could have gone smoother.  Could have also gone worse.  Least he's down.    Hello?   Hi, it's Dexter.  Wanted to tell you that I'm gonna be   a little later than I expected.    It's no problem.  My sister should be there any minute though.  Actually, she phoned too.  She's tied up at work.  Oh.  It's OK.  I don't mind staying late.  I I like watching him sleep.  You're a lifesaver.  I was gonna call you.  Is everything OK? He took his first step.  At least I think it was his first.    He did?   It was only one step, but you could tell he was really proud of himself.  That's amazing.  I managed to get a shot for you.  Check your email.  Thanks.  I'll call you when I'm on my way home.  My son is walking like a normal little boy.  I'm on my way there right now.  Just start trolling for eyewitnesses.  Maybe we'll catch a break.  Maybe someone saw something, OK?   Lieutenant LaGuerta?   Yes? Jim McCourt, Internal Affairs.  I wonder if I could have a word with you in private.  Of course.  So what's this about? Well, this is really a courtesy call.  We're about to launch a formal investigation into one of your detectives, a Angel Batista.  I understand he's your husband.  Yes.  Yes, he is.  Apparently, he had a physical altercation with one of his fellow officers.  A Sergeant Lopez.  I was under the impression the matter was settled.  Far from it.  Lopez collapsed while on duty today.  He's been hospitalised with internal bleeding.  My God.  We believe that he'll pull through, but he's filed charges.  Something else you should be aware of   we have two eyewitnesses who claim that they saw Batista kick Sergeant Lopez while on the ground.  Now, if that is true, that is assault with a deadly weapon.  And he could not only lose his job he could serve time.  Had to borrow this from you.  I hope you don't mind.  What the hell? Normally, I bring my own plastic, but I had to improvise.  Let me the fuck out of here.  I bet you've heard that before, \"let me out of here\", from all the women you've killed.  I wish you could see the room I set up for you.  Mmm.  But you fucked everything up, Boyd.  All those pictures I took of the women you killed.  It's a shame you'll never get to see them.  I'll just have to paint a word picture for you instead.  They were young.  Just starting their lives.  Now they're floating in formaldehyde and stuffed into barrels strewn around a swamp.  Who the hell are you? Just a fellow traveller, who also likes to pick up dead animals.  I did 'em a favour.  They were all suffering and I put 'em out of their misery.  Yeah, you'll be doing one more favour tonight.  What are you talking about? I've recently suffered a loss.  My wife was murdered by someone like you.  Someone like me.  It turned my life upside down.  Why is it my problem? Because you're the start of my healing process.  I knew you were fucked up the minute I laid eyes on you.  I was fucked up long before that.  You don't know what you're getting into.  Remember in the truck you asked me what I want? I want my wife back.  But this will have to do.  No church bells.  No hallelujah chorus.  Nothing feels different.  If anything, I'm emptier.  It's OK.  I'm not gonna hurt you.  It's OK.  Here.  No, don't.  Don't.  Stop.  No.  She saw everything.  She saw me.      Previous EpisodeNext Episode"

There is a great, big, shit ugly world out there, Jonah.  What do you want me to do?   OK, we had sex.    Was it good sex? I've said all I'm going to say.  Lopez collapsed while on duty today.  He's been hospitalized with internal bleeding.  Batista could not only lose his job, he could serve time.  I know who purchased the Santa Muerte icons.    What'd you get?   Two guys in their 30s.  Strong accents, possibly recent immigrants from Venezuela.  They did this to him because he started talking to me.  Boyd Fowler, Division of Dead Animal Pickup.  Hobbies   storing women in formaldehyde.  We'll do a shift together.  Tomorrow morning, eight sharp.  An old tourist welcome centre.  Totally isolated.  I wish you could see the room I set up for you.  All the women you've killed.  You don't know what you're getting into.  Don't! She saw everything.  She saw me.  I'm not liking the trend here.  You rip a man apart in a public bathroom No one saw.  You nearly botch Boyd's kill.    He's dead, isn't he?   Yeah.  And now you've got her.  What's the first rule of the code? Never kill an innocent.  Don't get caught.  So what's your plan here? Nurse her back to health so she can go to the police? She gives the cops enough to track you down, then everything falls apart.  Harrison grows up visiting you on death row.  Why are you doing this? Because she's dying.  And you're a serial killer.  I'd think you could handle that.  You didn't do this to her, Dex.  She's not your responsibility.  Go home and take care of your son.  It's OK.  Don't move.  Everything will be OK.  Don't! It's OK.  It's OK! Calm down.  Stop fighting me.  I'm not here to hurt you.  Stop! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!   What?   Jesus.  What's your problem? Sorry.  It's the middle of the night.  In California, maybe.  What's wrong with you? Nothing.  I'm just tired.  You are? I just pulled an all nighter at a crime scene.  Totally fried and I've got jack shit.  So the babysitter's been there all night? Masuka's trying.  He really is.  But the blood just doesn't talk to him the way it does to you.  I really need your help on this.    It's not a good time.  I've got Harrison.    What happened to the babysitter? Probably getting ready to kill me.  Look, I know you're still on leave, and you know I wouldn't ask if it weren't important.  Don't make me beg.  Deb, look, it's Maybe I can use the crime scene to get an ID on sleeping beauty here.    OK, I'll do it.    You will? Yeah.  Of course.  You're my sister.  Where, uh Where should I go? Just follow the fucking news vans.  You're the best, you know that? Hello? Dex, over here.  You're just in time, the coroner's chomping at the bit to remove the body.    It's a bit of a circus.    You kidding me? It's Barnum and Bailey.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  We're working on it!   What's he saying?   I have no idea.  But the general complaint is there are fewer beheadings in the rich parts of Miami.  Beheadings? Yeah.  And that's not even the fucked up part.    Dextrous.    Vince.  Whoa.  You weren't kidding about the fucked up part.  It was a potential witness.  And it's the second this week.  So what you got? Uh, we're thinking, uh, machete.    OK.  What else?   Just machete.  We've been up all night.  We're too tired to think.  That's why I called you.  So? So the beheading obviously went down here.  He was standing.  Whack one, and the victim goes down.  Whack two.  Whack three.  And cervical vertebrae are pretty much toast.  Separation complete.    We have lift off.    That's what I've been saying.  Not really.  Let him work.    Eyes and tongue removed here.    That tongue's in the ice chest.    Do you want to see it?   No, not really.    Has anyone been smoking in here?   It's 2010.  Who smokes? Uh Machete man, I think.  A small cigar.  Highly unstable ash.  Short, torn tobacco leaves.  It's a cheap one.  Like a Tiparillo.  I'd look for that.  So machete and Tiparillo.    Definitely styling.    Fuck me in both ears.  OK, people, our killers left through that door into the alley.  So let's sweep it for small cigar butts.  Watch your step, fellas.  Watch the ev.  Watch the ev! Thank you.  Watch the ev.  So that, uh, cigar ash stuff   Yeah?   You learn that in grad school?   Uh, Havana Room.    Havana Room.  Oh, good to have you back.  You know, in a supporting role.    Assisting me.    Yeah.  Thanks.  I got to go.  Don't you want to see if we find the cigar? I just want to find out who that girl is before the M99 wears off.  Absolutely.  I'll drop by the station later.  Well he's up.  He's been up for hours.  I know.  I missed you too.  I'm so sorry.  I know I'm late.  Late doesn't quite capture it.  It's been all night.  I know, it's just I killed a man in front of a witness I just had to tranquilise to keep her from scratching my eyes out.    What?   I'll make it up to you.    I don't think so.    What's that mean? It means I don't think this is a good fit and I won't be returning.  It is.  It is a good fit.  Harrison likes you.  And I really like him, which is what pains me so much about this, but He needs a reliable parent.  Especially with his mother gone.    I'm reliable.    Well, I guess we use different dictionaries.    It will never happen again.    Do you think? My mother told me when I was just a little girl, \"Never lie to someone who trusts you.  Never trust someone who lies to you. \" It's a shame, really.  We got off to such a good start.  I miss your mom.  I understand that, but the bureau said no.  Even though the only clue you have in the Trinity case is Kyle Butler, and I might know who that is.  That's right.    Ask again, Ray.    There's no point.  I thought you had clout.  Not when it comes to doing an end run on safe house procedures.  Look, offer still stands.  Give me the photo, I'll show it to the family.  I told you, I can't do that.  It's a sensitive situation.    It's your call.    Great.  Thanks.  Here we go.  There's the safe house, and there's Jonah Mitchell.  OK, we may have finally caught a break in the Santa Muerte case, so listen up, people.  Detective Morgan.  OK, it's too soon to celebrate, and most of us are too fucking tired anyway, but we found this just outside the back entrance of the bot\u00c3\u00a1nica where Fauzi was murdered.    Is that a cigar butt?   Very perceptive, Detective Quinn.  And may I thank you for getting your lazy ass off the couch and joining us.  So thank you.  It's a Tiparillo butt, and we have reason to believe it was handled by one of the two assailants.    So what are we talking about, DNA swab?   Even better.  Oh.  Uh There's a 3/4 partial thumbprint on the side, and it has to be processed manually.  It's incomplete.  But we expect to hear back within a day.  And there's the man we have to thank for it   my nephew, Harrison.  He lent us his dad.    Look at those cheeks! May I?   Sure.    Oh! \u00c2\u00a1Qu\u00c3\u00a9 lindo!   Gordito.  You look like your mommy.  Oh, and he's got daddy's eyes.  And your penis size.  No, it's bigger.  It's much bigger.  Who would have thought? Better than doughnuts.  Is this your idea of quality time, using your son as cover? He's enjoying it.  They're enjoying it.  It's a win win.  Besides, it's for a good cause.  I need to find out who this girl is before she wakes up.  Which will be soon.  Damn it.  Come on, come on.  What are you doing now? Stealing from a co worker? Borrowing.  You really think Vince Masuka won't notice half his medicine cabinet is missing? I don't care.  He's a hypochondriac.  She actually needs this stuff.  Lumen Ann Pierce, from Minnesota.  No warrants.  Not even a traffic violation.  Yeah, and no missing persons report either.  No one's looking for her.    What are you saying? I should let her die?   You can't just let her go.  This isn't some fairy tale where she wakes up and you get to be the handsome prince who saved her.  If she wakes up, she'll call the police.  You think I don't know that? How you doing?   Hey, isn't it about time for his nap?   Yeah.  I know the feeling.  You do? I flatlined hours ago.  I'm heading home to take a nap.  Hey, will you do me a favour and take him with you? I've got someone expecting me.    What about the nanny?   She needed a break.  After two days? It would be a huge help.  And he's gonna go right to sleep.  He's way overdue for a nap.  All right.  If you carry him to the car.  He's getting heavy.  Angel.    What's this?   An address.  I didn't want to give it to you in front of everybody else.  It's a hospital.  That's where Sergeant Lopez ended up after your little fight.    You need to go apologise.    No.  No.  No.  He's the one that should apologise to me.  He's the one who has a broken nose, a broken rib, and a punctured lung.  Angel, porfavor I should have broken his jaw for what he said about you.  I'm not going to argue with you.  Internal Affairs is coming by tomorrow, and they need to know that it's over.  That there's no bad blood between you, OK? I'm not asking.  Sorry if I scared you before.  Maybe we can start again? You probably have a headache.  The sedative does that.  I got you aspirin for it.  Also antibiotics.  You have a pretty serious fever.  They'll help bring that down.  I'm not trying to drug you.  They really are just antibiotics.  See? You're dehydrated.  Can you drink? Careful, careful, careful.  I'm not gonna hurt you.  Where am I? A safe place.  Far from Boyd.  I'm not taking anything.  What's your name? Look, you really need to talk to me.    Rachel.    OK.  Rachel I'm not gonna hurt you.  I just want to see you get better.  Why didn't you take me to the hospital? You know why.  No, I don't.  Because you saw me in the house.  I didn't see anything.  We both know that's not true.  I would never tell anyone.  Please let me go.    I can't.  What are you gonna do with me? Nothing.  Are you gonna sell me? Sell you? No.    Then what are you gonna do?   Nothing.  I'm not gonna do anything.  I'm not lying.  Look, you can't even think straight with a fever like that.  You need to take these.    No, no.    Stay away from me! I'm trying to help you!   Let me out! Let me out!   I can't do that! No! Please! Let me go! I can't! I can't! I can't go through it again! Just kill me now! Please! Harry's right.  I need a plan.    How you doing, Lopez?   How's it look like I'm doing? Listen, the other night we both had a little too much to drink and, um when you insulted my wife I just saw red.  I'm sorry.  I'm not the first guy to take a swing at you.  Are you really gonna bust my chops with IA over this? You know that line between a few and a few too many? All too well.  Yeah, well, I had way too many that night.  And I should have held my temper, but I didn't.  And I apologise.  Lo siento.  I don't know what else to say.  So are we OK or what? You're OK.  I'm in a fucking hospital.  No.  We're OK.  I'm not gonna press charges, Batista.  Now get the fuck out of my room.  The babysitter doesn't trust me because of the lies.  Lumen doesn't trust me because of the truth.  There must be a name for that.  Oh, right   Dexter Morgan.  The problem is Lumen knows way too much about me and I know nothing about her.  Hm.  An unpaid motel bill.  I was hoping for more, but at least it's a place to start.    Hey, how was your nap?   What nap?   He woke up the second we got back.    Oh.  Sorry.  Fix you something to eat? I'm too tired to chew.    Damn it, Dexter!   What? What is it? Nothing.  It's just What is this? It's a little toy keyboard.  No, I mean, why am I sitting on it? Why are we living like this? Between the baby stuff and your stuff and my stuff   which I can barely see anymore   I feel like a fucking refugee.  I get it.  I get it.  OK.  You need some peace and quiet.    We'll head out for a while.    Where are you going?   So what can I do for you?   I'm not sure.  I think my wife, his mom might have left her luggage here, Lumen Pierce.  Let's have a look see.  Can you spell that, please? Yeah, it's P l E R C E.  The other name.  The weird one.  No offence.  Lumen.  L U M E N.  Mm hm.  I remember her.  Your wife prepaid two weeks.  It's been over a month.  Yeah, change of plans.  We ended up staying with friends in North Beach.  Well, she never checked out.  We sent her file to a collection agency.  Gee, it'd be a lot simpler if you'd just let me take care of it.  Do you, by any chance, still have her luggage? Yeah, in storage.  I'd appreciate it.  We both would.  Three twenty and we're square.  OK.  Put your John Hancock here, and I'll go fetch your wife's luggage.  Great.  Ten months' old and you've had your first cigarette.  Sorry about that.  \"Dear Lumen \"I know it feels like the end of the world right now, but it's not.  \"I understand why you felt you had to leave.  \"And believe me, you have nothing to be ashamed of.  \"And as for your father, \"I know he said things he regrets, \"even though he'll never admit it.  \"We miss you.  We love you.  \"Take all the time you need, but then please come home.  \"It's not a family without you.  Lo\u00ce\u00bde Mom. \" Dexter.  Sorry.  I woke you up.  I was trying to be quiet.  You were gone a long time.  I was worried about you.  Just went for a little drive.  Sorry about before.  And in case you didn't know, you and Harrison are the most important people to me.  You're the only important people.  You guys can stay here forever.  I don't care about the mess.  I'm the fucking slob in the family anyway.    You want a beer?   Yeah.  I would love a beer.  Mr Morgan.  Please give us another chance.    I don't think it's a good idea.    I know I screwed up.  There's no need to apologise.  Harrison is a wonderful child, and you will have no trouble finding someone else to watch him.  I don't want someone else to watch him.    Well, I'm flattered And I heard you   about how you need to be able to trust me.  What I said was I don't trust you.  Look, there was an emergency.  A girl was badly hurt.  She was very near death.  I spent the night trying to help her, and then I was called to a crime scene by my sister.  That's where I was.  Really.  And I'm here now because we interviewed 30 people, and you're the one who didn't scare me, basically.  You're the only one I could trust Harrison to.  Well, you are holding him a little bit like a football.  Now what do they call it? A leap of faith.  I guess it's one on both our parts.  One more chance, Mr Morgan, but that's it.  Look at this.    Look at what?   Notice anything missing? How would I know? Somebody's been dipping into my meds, and methinks me knows who.  Yeah, Dexter was back here alone yesterday.    I don't know, maybe it was him.    No motive, Detective.  You, on the other hand, have been getting down and dirty with the hottest potty mouth in the South.  Now, I appreciate you taking preventative measures so as not to pass on whatever sick scurvy you may carry on to her.  Hm.  I'm willing to share.  All you have to do is ask.  OK, I didn't take your meds.  And I'm not getting down and dirty with Debra.  OK? May I just say that I admire your chivalry? It's a rare man who won't kiss and tell.  Make sure you get the names and numbers   Get back to me when you finish.    Mm hm.  Excuse me.  McCourt.  Just wanted to let you know that I paid Sergeant Lopez a visit yesterday.    So I heard.    I apologised, he accepted.  We're Jake.  It's all good.  Hey, you put a cop in the hospital.  What happens now is up to the department, not him.  Meaning what? Fact is, it's assault and battery against a fellow officer.  It's a few punches against a drunken loudmouth.    Good morning, Jim.    Lieutenant.  You mean to tell me you have nothing more important to do than to investigate a bar fight? How's the timeline coming on the Santa Muerte case? The timeline's just fine.  I'm due upstairs in 20 minutes, so we should get going.    Would you like some coffee?   That would be wonderful.    My husband's not wrong, you know.    How's that? Considering the fact that the other officer involved The assault victim.  It was just a bar fight, Jim.  Now, you and I both know they happen all the time.    OK, I'm wondering what can end this.    See, I'm more interested in what started it.  Because according to Sergeant Lopez's deposition, he said, drunkenly, that you give the best blowjob in Miami.  Is that part of the official record? Should it be? Hey, good news.  Masuka found a match on that partial print we had from the cigar butt.  Or are you no longer interested in solving homicides?   Huh?   Carlos Fuentes.  You're gonna love this.  He's got a brother, Marco.  They live together, and I got the address.  Two of them.  Does that sound like what we've been looking for, or does that sound like what we've been looking for? I'll get a team together.  Let's get these guys.  Where's Quinn again? Fucknose is gonna miss the party.  I have no idea.  Who knows? Fuck.  Hold on.  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  OK, go.  Go, go, go, go.  Morgan, you, you, you, the other end of the hall.  You, upstairs.    Freeze!   No, no.  We want Fuentes.  Let him go.  Let him go.  Go! Open up.  Police.  Police.  Polic\u00c3\u00ada.  Nobody move.  Holy shit.  We want these guys.  Fuentes.  Fuentes.  Fuentes.  No habla.  Cut him and I'll blow your fucking head off.  You hear me? Let him go.    You let him go!   Everybody clear? Report in.  Diaz, clear.    Manzon, clear.    Responder.    Detective Morgan, you clear?   Responder.  Yes, clear.  You stupid bitch.  Argh! Help! Medic! I need a fucking medic! Don't you dare let him die.    You OK?   Fine.  Fuck, I should have shot Fuentes when I had the chance!   And risk killing that kid?   He might die anyway.  And he might live, thanks to you.  We nearly caught those fucks.    You did good.    You weren't there.  Lumen Ann Pierce, from Minnesota.  If I can get the crotchety judgmental babysitter from Ireland to trust me I say, why not you? Yah! Stop! Stop! Help me! Help! Help me! Do you need a ride? Yeah, what are you doing out here? Hey, where are you going? Man, she is fucked up! No! No!   No! No!   Lumen   No! No!   Lumen.  Lumen Lumen.  Lumen.  Would you stop? Stop.  Would you stop! Shh! You know how close you came back there? If she'd gotten in that car, it would have been all over.  Where are we going? Believe me, she will never trust you.  Where are you taking me? First rule of the code   don't get caught.  And you're out of options now.    Let me go.    She's left you no choice.  Quiet.  Jonah? Hey.  Don't be afraid.  I'm a cop.    Miami Metro.    Do I know you? I think I know who Kyle Butler is.  Do you recognise this man?   Why do you want to know?   Is this Kyle Butler?   Hey, back away! Back away!   I'm a cop.  It's OK.  Keep your hands where I can fuckin' see 'em, and shut the hell up.  Jonah, go to the car now.  Turn around.  Come on.  Move.    Please.  Don't!   Just move.  What are you gonna do?   Look at this.    No! No! Look.  This is what happened to the girls before you.  This is what was gonna happen to you.  Every one of these barrels has a body in it.  Boyd preserved them in formaldehyde so he could come and visit.  Do you understand? I saved your life.  How do I know that you didn't kill these girls? You don't.  It's a leap of faith for both of us.  My wife was murdered brutally by someone like Boyd.  I don't want to see any more innocent people die.  Here, you don't believe me? Take it.  No.  Take it.  It's yours.  Are you done? I tell you to leave Trinity's family alone, and instead you go behind my back.  And based on what? This? A cut and paste sketch you think resembles Dexter Morgan?   The kid recognised him.    He identified Dexter as Kyle Butler? He didn't get a chance, but I could tell.  Oh, you could tell.  And did Jonah convey this ID to the FBI?   No.    Right.  Because it's bullshit.  You have your suspicions, you come to me.    I tried.    And when I say no, Quinn, it's over! You're on unpaid suspension until further notice.  Suspension? Just tell everyone you're taking a few vacation days.  You kidding? Am I fucking kidding? You're lucky I don't terminate your ass.  And you know the one reason I don't? Because there'd be a mandatory hearing, and this whole embarrassment would become a matter of record.  No one needs to hear about your stupid theories.  It would tear this department apart.    Understood?   Sure.  He just lost his wife, for Christ's sakes! Hey, skeezey.  Where you been all day? Very long, fucked up story.  I heard about the raid.  Perp got away.  What I heard was you saved someone's life.  I let you down.  I should've been there to back you up.    Yeah, you should've.    Yeah.  You OK? I guess not, cos everybody keeps asking me that.  I don't want to be alone tonight.  Deb, I'm no good for you.  I'm not looking for good right now.  Is that true? What you said about your wife? Yes.  How did it happen? Knife.  Painful and cruel.  I'm sorry that I cut you.  I thought you were a monster, like Boyd.  I thought you were going to kill me.  Or worse.  I was locked up.  I don't know where, or for how long.  All I know is that it was horrible.  And I thought it would never stop.  But it has stopped.  He's dead.  It's over.  You can go home.  I don't think so.  You can.  I read your letter.  I know you have a family who loves you.  You should go home to them.  It's not that simple.  It is.  It really is.  Boyd wasn't the only one who did this to me.  There were others.  It's not over.      Previous EpisodeNext Episode"

According to Sergeant Lopez's deposition, you give the best blowjob in Miami.  Do you recognise this man? Jonah, is this Kyle Butler? Back away! Back away! You're on unpaid suspension until further notice.  Suspension? Just tell everyone you're taking a few vacation days.  I don't want to be alone tonight.  I'm no good for you.  I'm not looking for good right now.  I just want to find out who that girl is before the M99 wears off.  Lumen Ann Pierce.    Why didn't you take me to the hospital?   Because you saw me.    I didn't see anything.    We both know that's not true.  Every one of these barrels has a body in it.    Look at this.    No.  This is what happened to the girls before you.  This is what was going to happen to you.  I saved your life.  I was locked up.  And I thought it would never stop.  But it has stopped.  He's dead.  It's over.  Boyd wasn't the only one who did this to me.  There were others.  We all have something to hide, some dark place inside us we don't want the world to see.  So we pretend everything's OK wrapping ourselves in rainbows.  And maybe that's all for the best, because some of these places are darker than others.  Whoo! Carefully.  I want to believe that smile.  That watching your mother die hasn't changed you, the way watching mine changed me.  Gently falling.  Sweetheart! Sweetheart, what is it? Oh! It's OK.  It's OK! He's got a scratch.  Looks like someone was playing a little rough.  That's a little too familiar.    Let's get a Band Aid on him.    OK.  That's it for today! But I use a scalpel.  All you have are your fingers.  Wiped clean.  Not even a year old, you're already destroying evidence.  And having to flee the scene of the crime.  Oh! It's OK.  Every time you see me, you look disappointed, like you were hoping to find an empty table.  Guilty.  I still think you need to consider my advice.  Leave town? Go home to people who care about you.  I told you why I can't do that.  If you stay in Miami, you'll never get past this.  If you had something horrible happen to you, could you just forget about it and move on? I would want to.  What if you couldn't? If you really want to help me get past this, help me find those guys and kill them.  I saw you kill Boyd.  You knew what you were doing.  Usual? Thanks.  Going after those men won't help you get past this.  It'll only make it worse.  How could it get worse? It'll open up something inside you you don't want to know is there.  Trust me.  Trust you? I don't even know your last name.  The less you know about me, the better.    Better for who?   For the both of us.  If you're not gonna help me, why do you keep coming back here? I'm trying to help you.  Minneapolis.  Yeah, I used some miles.  Wow.  You really want to get rid of me, don't you? I want you to get on with your life.  Lumen She took the ticket.  Maybe this is one problem I can check off the list.  And maybe it'll snow this week.  Where's the fire? Got to get my ass in gear, or I'm gonna be late.  I could take that ass back to bed.  What part of \"late\" don't you understand? I mean, at least let me make you breakfast or something.  I have no time.  I've got to meet Batista at the hospital.  We're interviewing that kid Fuentes sliced open.  Good luck with that.  \"Good luck with that\"? Fuentes has killed three people.  I'm running down leads, and you're sitting around in your boxer shorts watching TV all day.  Is that why you're, like, all, \"Let me get the fuck out of here. \"   Cos I'm taking a few days off?   Just drop it.  This wasn't even my call.  LaGuerta said I had too many days.  I had to use 'em or lose 'em.    That's bullshit.    No argument here.  I gotta go.  Quinn's my partner.  He should be here, not you.  No offence.  What do you want me to do? He put in for his time.  No, he told me he was forced to take his leave.    That doesn't make any sense.    Exactly.  So will you talk to LaGuerta   Shit.    What?   It's the mother.  What is she doing?   She's coming this way.  Fuck me so bad.  What am I supposed to say? \"I'm sorry.  It's my fault your son got his throat slit\"? No, let me do the talking.  De nada, de nada.  If it's OK with you, we'd like to ask your son some questions.    S\u00c3\u00ad.    Yes.  Gracias.  Jandro, how you feeling? \u00c2\u00bfC\u00c3\u00b3mo te sientes?   Poquito mejor.    A little better.  Bueno.  We were wondering if there's anything you can tell us about the man who injured you.  Uh He's seen him around, but he didn't know who he was.  I asked if he had heard anything about Fuentes around the neighbourhood.  Does he remember anything about that day, anything Fuentes said or did? Anything at all? He doesn't remember anything else.  He was really scared.  Fuentes said he was going to kill him.  OK.  Gracias.  Uh He had a mark on his hand.    A small one.    Like a tattoo? S\u00c3\u00ad, como un tatuaje.  Can you draw it for us? Lumen needs to stay away from the darkness.  I, on the other hand, always need names for my table, and there are few people more deserving than Boyd Fowler's accomplices.  Nothing in Boyd's arrest record even hints he had help.  Zero to go on.  I'll have to look elsewhere.  Yours.  Thanks.  You didn't have to do that.  No, it really is yours.  You left it on the hood of your car.  Oh.  My head's in 50 places.  Masuka didn't even begin to keep up the caseload.  Well, good luck getting the midget porn off your hard drive.  He might have shown it to me.  How was Mommy And Me? Harrison break any hearts? No, but he drew his first blood.  I think his little black book still has a few blank pages.    Well, not for long.    He missed you this morning.  He's used to having his Aunt Deb feed him his mango oatmeal.  Yeah, sorry.  You didn't come home last night.  No, it was late, and I didn't want to wake you.    I just crashed at a friend's house.    Oh.  What friend? What, are you Mom now? You want to do lunch? I think I'm gonna be dining on backlog.  And paying a visit to Boyd's house.  Hm.  All right, well, I'll bring you something back.  Bye.  Wait a second.  What? Give me your opinion as a female.    As a female?   As a woman, you know? McCourt.    What about him?   Do you find him attractive? Do you? I mean, would you ever? I would rather put a campfire out with my face.  OK? I checked in with Cira.  She's gonna stay on the ATM video surveillance   while I track down the tattoo.    Let me see that again.  See, it still looks like a UFO to me.    Who the fuck knows, right?   Yeah.    We need to talk to an expert.    An expert, huh? Mm hm.  The dragon lady represents the dualities of my inner warrior.  Or your inner idiot.  Hey! If you can't muster up the appropriate respect, I'm dropping the curtain.  When did you get this? I've been adding to it over time, but the main work started about two years ago.  I was having a bit of a crisis, and this was my way of working through it.    Viagra probably would have been cheaper.    This was a crisis of the soul, Morgan.  Don't you have to have a soul before it could be in crisis?   Point is, you know a little about this world.    I know a little.  The person you want to talk to is my body artist, Michael Angelo.    You're kidding.  Michelangelo?   Two words.  Michael Angelo.  And, yes, I'm serious.  If your tattoo were done by anyone local, Michael Angelo will know.  You can lower the curtain.  From the outside, a normal home is indistinguishable from the home of a monster who puts women in barrels.  But step inside There must be something around here that will point me to Boyd's accomplices.  Somebody's been here.  Oh, great.  Blood.  They were going through Boyd's files.  Whoever Boyd was working with must have panicked, tried to cover up any trace of their existence.  Amateurs.  Here he is, freshly bathed, clean as a whistle and ready for bed.    Thanks.    I'm gonna get going.  Cheque's on the counter.  Sonya, can I ask you a question? Sure.  Have you ever noticed Harrison being aggressive? Aggressive? What do you mean? Scratching, stuff like that.  No.  He's a very gentle child, really.  Why? There might have been an incident at one of the Mommy And Me classes.  Can't be sure it was Harrison or not.  He's a little boy.  My little brother used to bite people.  Bloody little cannibal.  Now he's a vegetarian, works for Greenpeace.  Well, that's comforting.  Not to worry.  You've got a little angel on your hands.  Nothing can change that.    See you tomorrow morning.    Night.  No match for Daddy in the criminal database.  You're absolutely right.  Maybe he drives.  Let's check the DMV.  Minnesota.  Lumen Ann Pierce.  She broke into Boyd's house.  She beat me to it.  Oh, my God.  Dexter, this seem like the product of a stable mind? A closet was the only place she felt safe from them.  She's remade it here.    Dexter, are you listening to me?   Yes, I'm listening.  She's not a killer.  She's not you.  She's coming undone.  What's that now? This is the letter she took from Boyd Fowler's house.  From his ex cellmate, Robert Brunner.  \"I'm getting paroled next week.  Need a place to 'sleap'. \" S L E A P.  She's found a target.  You don't know what she's planning.  I know this isn't gonna end well.  She keeps going this way, she's gonna get herself killed or thrown in jail, and you're gonna be right there with her.  Dex, she's gonna bring you down.  I know what you're doing.    Having breakfast?   You're looking for the men who hurt you.  So What, you're spying on me now? What are you gonna do if you actually find one of these guys? Maybe   what you won't.    Are you gonna kill them? Is that it? I'm sorry.  You don't get to tell me what to do.  I asked for your help.  You turned me down.  For your own good.  Look You saved my life.  I'm grateful for that.  But what I need from you right now is to leave me alone.    Lumen   Don't touch me! These men put five women in barrels.  They're not gonna want to be found.  Please stop this before it's too late.  She's not going to stop until she finds Brunner.    My favourite colour.    Help you, Sergeant? Morgan has been all over me the last two days about Quinn.    What about Quinn?   The vacation he's being forced to take.  She's feeling shorthanded without her partner.    To tell you the truth, we need him.    Well, it's the union.  Not my call.  That all? Is there anything I need to know about my case with IA? Mm mm.  Is there anything I need to know about anything else? I'm sorry, Angel, but I gotta go.  Sure.  I'll see you tonight? Yeah Um I might be late.  OK, so I'll let you know.  OK? Hope you didn't have to dig too deep.  Only eight boxes, but I always remember to lift with my back.  Well, here's the guy you asked for   Robert Brunner.    Nuh uh uh! Like we agreed.    Right.    Hm.    There you go.  Aw.  Oh! That face! Abduction, torture, rape.  He's so big.  Is he a year yet?   Ten months.    He's beautiful.    Thank you.    Mm hm.  Seven years for sexual assault.  Out in three for good behaviour.  Mm.  Good behaviour.  You ever seen scars like that? Yes.  On Lumen.  And he's out now.  Thank you, State of Florida.  Looks like she stumbled on to the right guy.  It says he's living under Tuttle Bridge.  Is this current? Mm hm.  Sex offenders can't live anywhere near kids.  Tuttle's the only place they can go.    Can I keep this?   Well, that depends, now.  You gonna bring this little cutie by to see me?   Will do.    OK.  Tuttle Bridge is the perfect place for Brunner to hide in the dark, but not from me.  I've got to get to him before she does.  Yo, what's up? Tramp stamp.  I think I'm in love.  She's into needles.  Why don't you show her your dick? That's disgusting.  You are so judgmental, Morgan.  I mean, come on.  We all have our own ways of expressing ourselves.  I have my ink, and you have your man boots.  Yeah? Well, expect my man boots up your ass if you're wasting my time, OK? Vincent? Now, what can I do you for?   That's Michael Angelo?   The one and only.    M, how are you?   Come here.    Good to see you.    Always good to see you.  M, this is the detective I was telling you about   Detective Morgan.    Enchant\u00c3\u00a9e.    Right.  You mind taking a look at something for us? Any friend of Sugar's is a friend of mine.  \"Sugar\"? OK.  We interviewed this kid who saw this on the hand of a suspect we're looking for.  Any idea what it means? Crude, simplistic, but it's definitely an eye.  Look.  The similarity.    See?   And that would mean? Eyes symbolise the third eye in our minds, like the god Horus and also just like the back of a dollar bill.  Hm.  Have you ever done something like this? Well, if I had, I would have remembered it.  Anything else you can tell us? We're kinda desperate here.  Without it in front of me, that's the best I can do.    I'm sorry.    No, it's OK.  M, thank you so much, anyways.  Always for you.  And you You come see me anytime, OK? OK, thank you.    OK.    OK, bye.  Bye.    I'll be in soon.    Bye.  Hey, I think she likes you.  Don't ever speak about this.  Since we're already here, why don't you get Quinn's name put on your   Hey, I have a gun.    I'll just wait in the car.  OK.    Hello?   Cira, it's me.    Any luck?   Just a steaming pile of fuck all.  Please tell me you have something.  I've gone through most of the bank's ATM footage.  Eight names and counting.  They're all freaking out about something while they're withdrawing maximum amounts from their accounts, just like our first Santa Muerte vics.  I want addresses for all eight names and any others you can find.  I'll pick you up on my way to work tomorrow, and we'll check 'em out, OK? Poor Julia Tuttle.  The Mother of Miami.  They named this bridge after her in her honour.  Now it's crawling with paedophiles and sex offenders.  So much for honour.  Japan's total area is slightly smaller than the US State of Montana You mind if I watch? The kid fuckers stay over by the tracks.  That's not why I'm here.  And why is that? A stuck up little co ed and I had a legal disagreement concerning the meaning of the word \"consent\".  Take a load off.  Appreciate it, brother.  Where'd you do your time? Okeechobee.  My last stretch was in that shithole.  Rough place.  Yeah.  Told everyone I was in for armed robbery to keep a target off my back.    You from Miami?   Used to be.  Guy I bunked with lives down here now.  Thought I'd let him show me the town and have some fun.  Did that fun include Lumen? That is until my parole officer, the cunt, started giving me shit about staying with someone from the joint.    Wound up here.    Hmm.    Beats a cell.    Barely.  Once my parole is done, fuck Florida.  I'm going north.  Get me some of that farm fresh pussy.    You ever tap that?   Can't say I have.  A couple weeks ago I had this hot, little blonde on all fours.  A few of us did.  Believe me, that bitch got every fucking inch   of my motherfucking   That's enough.  This room was meant for Boyd, not his cellmate.  They were co workers, partners.    Basically the same.    You're sure? I need to kill him so Lumen doesn't have to.  I don't want her down that road.    Think about what you're doing.    I am.    He's a sex offender   I know.  on parole.    What are you saying?   Think! Are you listening? OK.  He's wearing an ankle bracelet.  It couldn't have been him.  She had the wrong guy.  I was ready to kill him.  I was ready to kill him! Robert Brunner isn't one of the men who hurt her.  Harry's right.  I have to convince Lumen to do what I never could   to move on.  You're home early.    Where's Sonya?   I sent her home.  She said you were gonna be working late.    Hope you don't mind, I grabbed a beer.    What's he doing here? He wanted to borrow   a book.    He reads?   Yeah, he does.    Here.  Thanks.  Little vacation reading.  Quinn was just leaving.  What she said.  I will call you in the morning, Joseph.  Oh.  OK, Debra.  Kinda warm for gloves.    Good night.    Thanks for the book.  What was that about? It's late, so I'll take the couch.  Are you and Quinn? We're fuck buddies.  That's it.  You need Quinn for that? I know it's insane.  I know it's wrong for a fuck ton of reas Will you please stop looking at me like that? It's your life, Deb.  Just don't bring him around when Harrison's here.    What's that supposed to mean?   He's at an impressionable age.    We don't know what might rub off on him.    What will rub off on him?   Just keep Quinn away from my son.    Fine.  You know, you're wrong about Quinn.  He's not that bad.  Hey.  Sorry.  Long day.  Dinner's in the oven.  You mind if I, um, hop in the shower first? You never called.  Yeah, I know.  I just lost track of time.  Why so late? Budgets are due at the end of the month, so I'm gonna   I'll set the table.    Thanks.  She's not there.  You just missed her.    Did my wife say where she was going?   You two still not seeing eye to eye? Look, I really need to find her.  It's important.  She was asking about Tuttle Bridge.  I told her that is the last place she wants to be.  What the fuck, asshole? Nice.  Where you going, baby? What are you doing?   I'm taking you out of here.    Give me the gun.    No.    Give it to me! You have no idea what those animals did to me.  Passing me around.  I couldn't move.  I couldn't stop them.    It wasn't Brunner.    It was.  He was Boyd's cellmate.  He raped three women! He tortured them, just like he did to me.    That's impossible.    You weren't there! Just listen to me.  He's wearing an ankle bracelet as part of his parole.  If he leaves this place, it gets reported.  I checked.  He was here the whole time you were taken.  Robert Brunner's never seen you before.  He's never touched you.  He never hurt you.  You were about to murder the wrong man.  Oh, fuck.  You see? This is where it leads.  But it's not too late.  There's still no blood on your hands.  I just I just want to feel better.  I want all this to go away.  It will.  I don't see how it can.  Go home.  Back to your family.  If you don't put this behind you, I swear what you're feeling now will only get worse.  Oh OK.  OK, OK, I'll go.  OK.  Next one on our ATM list.  that's how I like to start my fucking day.  You want to make a bet why this one was taking a wad of cash out of the ATM? Gambling, hookers, drugs? You're very cynical.  It's called being a detective.  And blow me.  You have to put positive energy out into the universe.  Right.  Blow you.  You smell that? Holy shit.    Little help here? Anytime you're ready.    Yeah.  This is Detective Morgan requesting CSI and body transport at 2075 Ocean Way for a possible double homicide.  And you need to tell Masuka and Dexter that they need to bring a bug kit and some fucking crackers.  You good? You son of a bitch.    Angel!   Sergeant, you're making a big mistake! The only mistake I made was not kicking your ass when you first laid eyes on my wife.  Angel, let him go! This is a sting! Let him go!   You're wearing a wire?   No shit.  You idiot.  What would have happened   if he barged in here a half hour ago?   I know.  Just give us a minute, Jim.  You just don't learn, do you, Batista? Have you completely lost your mind?   I thought   What? That I was fucking him? What am I supposed to think? You barely talk to me.  The late nights, the sneaking around.  How'd you find us? Wait.  You I don't even want to know.  IA needed my help to bust a narcotics cop on the take, and I said yes.  Why? To close the books on your bar fight! So I don't want to hear about sneaking around and late nights!   Why didn't you tell me?   Why didn't you trust me? Maria, I Morgan needs us on site   double homicide.    My car's outside.    I'll ride with Patrol.  Fuck me.  Come on, Liddy.  Lieutenant, any comment?   Not now.    Lieutenant LaGuerta It's like the fucking food chain in action in there.  Flies   the blowflies are attracted by the smell and they lay eggs, and the beetles, they're drawn by the larvae,   and they burrow into every orifice   I get it.  What do we know? The vics' names are Daniel and Awilda Ortiz.  ATM footage showed Daniel trying to make a maximum withdrawal about 4 weeks ago.  Officer Manzon and I show up to interview him, and we find the bodies.  The remains have already started to mummify, but the wounds are consistent with a machete.  I can make sure when I get them back to the lab.    We like the Fuentes brothers for this.    Only weird thing is, we can't find any Santa Claus Muerte mumbo jumbo bullshit.  We might be looking at the Fuentes brothers' first victims.  The defensive wounds and heavy smearing suggest our killers were still inexperienced.  Beheading requires skill.  So we got their goddamn training wheels kill? Means we're back to fucking square one.  A little downwind, please.  Oh, yeah.  That's never coming out.  I liked this shirt, too.  I'll get a jacket out of my car.  All right.  It was never a tattoo.  It was a stamp from a nightclub.  It was a fucking nightclub! It's a nightclub!   What's gotten into her?   Find out, Sergeant.  I'm gonna go deal with the press.  Nice to have you back, Dexter.  Good to be back, Lieutenant.  Reports on my desk, first thing.  Ah, all together once again.  One big happy family.  Eh, Dexerino? Yeah.    You don't have to wait.    I don't mind.  I can pay you back for the ticket.  I'll send you some money.  Except I still don't know who to send it to.  Dexter Morgan.  And it's not necessary.  The ticket.  I came to Miami for a fresh start.    Somewhere warm.    You're doing the right thing.  Your parents will be happy to see you.  I tried to call them, but I I couldn't.  What would I say? Just give it some time.  I can't tell them what happened to me.  I can't tell anyone.  You're the only one who knows.  You have my number.  Call me if you need to talk about it.    I should   Oh, yeah.  Thank you.  You're welcome.  Go ahead, put it through.  And your bags.  Make sure everything's out of your pockets.  Jewellery, belts.  Step to the mat, ma'am.    Is there a problem?   I can't let you through to your gate unless you consent to a hand search.  Lift your arms.  I need you to stay still.  Spread your legs.    Are you home?   Uh   Not quite.    Are you at a bar? I had to gas up the car.  My fault O'Malley's is on the way?   So ask me how my day was.    How was your day? It was better than yours, slacker, cos I know where Carlos and his brother have been hanging out.    At a local club called the Mayan.    You got your lead.  Congrats.  We stake this place out, they show up, then we take these Santa Muerte no dicks down for good.  How about I get steaks and beer and we celebrate? There's nothing to celebrate just yet, but I have a good feeling about this one.    Now get your ass moving, I'm starving.    On my way.  Thanks for the Cuervo, Stud.  No problem.  I heard what happened.  Fuck those IA rats.  And your boss.  She's the reason I'm here.  Unpaid leave.  Why? For doing my fucking job.  That bitch put handcuffs on me, then that no nuts McCourt parades me around that station like I'm a goddamn carnival prize.  Well, they can both go fuck the dog.  They think I'm gonna cop a plea, they're both cracking walnuts up their ass.  I'm gonna fight this thing to my last damn dime.  You need some extra cash for those lawyers   I might have a job for you.    Really?   What would that be?   Looking into someone.    Who?   Guy I work with.    Interested?   I don't know if I should be, considering who's sitting in front of me making the offer.  What are you talking about? Have I ever fucked you over? No, but LaGuerta just taught me there's always a first time.  Look, Quinn you fuck with the bull you get the horn.    You understand?   Yeah.  Do you?   You got a name?   Dexter Morgan.  Dexter.  What the fuck kind of name is Dexter? Rainbows are an illusion   refracted light to make us think something's there when it's really not.  Is there darkness in Harrison? Or is it just my own fear being reflected back? I just know he's the one who scratched Teddy.  He was right next to him.  Did you read about what happened to his mother? That boy will never be the same.  There's nothing wrong with my son.  I'm sorry for ever thinking the worst, Harrison.  You'll always be my son.  Whatever we have to face, we'll face together, OK? Ow! Hello, ma'am.  Where you headed this afternoon? You need a cab? Welcome to Miami.      Previous EpisodeNext Episode"

We were wondering if there's anything you can tell us about the man who injured you.  I know where Carlos and his brother have been hanging out   at a local club called The Mayan.    You got your lead.  Congrats.    Yeah, we stake this place out, they show up, and then we take these Santa Muerta no dicks down for good.    Are you and Quinn   We're fuck buddies.  Don't bring him around when Harrison's here.    Would you like some coffee?   That would be wonderful.  Son of a bitch.    Hey, hey, hey! Sergeant!   Angel, let him go.  This is a sting! IA needed my help to bust a narcotics cop on the take, and I said yes, to close the books on your bar fight!   Fuck those IA rats.    And your boss.  That bitch put handcuffs on me.  I might have a job for you.    You got a name?   Dexter Morgan.  Boyd wasn't the only one who did this to me.  There were others.  What are you gonna do if you actually find one of these guys?   What you won't.    You going to kill them? You don't get to tell me what to do.  What are you doing? You were about to murder the wrong man.  Go home.  OK.  OK, OK, I'll go.  You're doing the right thing.  Your parents will be happy to see you.  Thank you.  Maybe this is one problem I can check off the list.  Welcome to Miami.  I've always tried to keep the different parts of my life separate.  Becoming a father made that much more difficult.  And as a husband, I failed.  But I'm a very neat monster who won't make the same mistake again.  I packed up Rita's wedding dress.  I thought Astor might want it someday.  Feels like it took you guys months to move in Only a day to pack up.  The realtor suggested we paint the walls white.  She wants to stage the house Miami Chic.  No evidence that a family ever lived here.  Or died here.  You have to disclose that, don't you? The hope is that a ridiculously low listing price will help a buyer see past that.  Any idea where you want to live? I'm sorry.  That was a stupid question.  You should take the apartment.  No.  No, that's yours.  No, I insist.  It's really always been yours.    I'll move out.    I thought you already did.  I didn't move in with Quinn.  Well, you're never around.  I'm at Quinn's, but I don't live there.  No clothes in any drawers.  There's no his and hers toothbrush action.  Quinn's place is all Quinn.  A vast, empty space? I don't remember Rita in these.  Because they belong to Lumen.  Me either.  Lumen is home in Minneapolis, another part of my life packed away.  Life seems different now.  Manageable.  Everything in its right place.  Soon, Lance Robinson will be on my table.  Lance trawls the internet, engaging in casual encounters with innocent men who never suspect those encounters could turn deadly.  Four times Lance deliberately pushed someone's fantasies too far.  He will be an easy kill, just like old times.  Tonight's the night.  OK, people.  Let's go over our positions at Club Mayan.  Everybody be in place by 10.  Batista and I'll be in the van, as usual.  Quinn, you'll watch the door.  Cira   Yes, Chief?   Don't let me stop you.  Officer Manzon, you'll be on the floor watching foot traffic at the VIP room,   in case the Fuentes brothers roll through.    And what if they don't? Then we'll work the operation until they do.  You were face to face with Carlos Fuentes, right? Yes, sir.  Then that means he knows that we're onto him.  Tell me why they would ever return to this club.  The only reason the Fuentes brothers are forcing people to withdraw cash from the ATM, is to pay for table service at this club.  We ran the dates of the ATM hold ups past the club managers.  And they confirmed that on each of those nights, the Fuentes brothers showed up at Club Mayan, and took over the VIP lounge.  So if the Fuentes brothers do show up at this club, which is highly unlikely, it means that someone is possibly lying on the floor of their living room without their head.  We're working the only lead we have.  All you're doing is drinking and dancing on the taxpayer's dime.  I would have expected more from you, Morgan.  Chief.  We don't have a lot of options here.  Without this operation, we're effectively stopping work on this case, which we cannot do to this community.  Did you even know this operation was happening? Of course I knew.  Why wouldn't I? Well, it seems you've been spending a lot of time lately with Internal Affairs bailing your new husband out of hot water.  Bravo, Mrs Batista.  I'm keeping my name.  And I think working Club Mayan is a valid allocation of my squad's resources.  It is your squad, Lieutenant.    How you manage it is up to you.    Thank you.  But if another murder goes up on the board, it's your ass on the line, not mine.  You have one more night at Club Mayan.  Make something happen.  Matthews doesn't have much faith in us, does he? Well, that fight you had at the bar didn't help anything.    He knows about the bar fight?   Of course he knows.  A narcotics officer got suspended because of that bar fight.  No.  A narcotics officer got suspended because of you.    Me?   You ran to IAD.  You cooked up the sting.  You basically got Stan Liddy fired.  And got all the charges against you dropped.  I didn't ask for any of that.  I could have handled whatever IAD had coming my way.    Oh, so anything that happens is fine?   When it happens to me, yes.  I can take care of myself.  But now we're married, whatever happens to me, happens to you.  That's right.  That's exactly right.    We're married.    Well, here's what's bothering me.  You weren't looking out for me out of some sense of compassion.  You were taking care of yourself.  God forbid your name should lose some of its shine.    Get out of my office.    Mm hm.    Hey.    I thought you might want a debriefing before we hit Club Mayan.  Um, sort of not a good time.  Where's Quinn, and what have you done with him? I know, I know.  Uh Just give me an hour.    An hour.    Yeah.  Who's naked in your apartment? No one is naked.  Then what?   I'm such a fucking idiot.    Debra, wait.  Come here.  Debra, come here.  Debra Morgan, this is Stan Liddy.  Liddy had a run in with IAD and, uh, got suspended.  We're prepping him for his union rep meeting tomorrow.  Sorry.  All clothes are staying on.    I'll just   Meet me there? Yeah, I'll meet you there.  You are boning our target's sister? Just tell me what you found out on Dexter Morgan.  Well your boy's squeaky clean on paper.  He's only been out of the country once, to Paris.  Pays his bills on time, keeps to himself.  I'll tell you, it's all too neat and a little too phoney.  You see drug dealers with the very same profiles all the time.  Ah.  That's exactly what I'm thinking.  I mean, what's he hiding? Peekaboo.  \"Bye bye, Daddy. \" Peekaboo! Oh, thank you.  You're really very good with him.  I wish I didn't have to work tonight.  The lab fell so far behind while I was out.  Night's the only time I can ever get anything done.  Well, I hope the lieutenant appreciates your dedication.  I'm pretty sure she does.  Although tonight will be dedicated to Lance.  So, you think about midnight, then? I'll try to make it sooner.  Can you say, \"Bye bye, Daddy\"? Die die.  Did you hear that?   He said, \"Die die. \"   Don't be silly.  He said, \"Bye bye. \" Harrison's first word.  There's a good boy.  I hope so.  Die die.  From the mouth of babes.  I rented an RV, placed an ad online saying I was cruising down to The Keys, and just like that my victim came to me.  You must be ten inches of pure steel.  You betcha.  Compartmentalisation began as an architectural theory   divide buildings into sections which can be closed off to prevent a fire from spreading.  Life can also be divided into closed off sections.  Makes everything much simpler.  Lumen Pierce.  Again? This is the life Harry wanted for me carefully divided.  Shh! What the hell? Dexter! I I shot one of them.  I killed him.  I'm at the marina Bayshore, Biscayne or something?   You're in Miami?   I never left.  Oh, there's so much blood.  What do I do? Hello? Hello? Dexter, don't hang up on me! Please, help me.  Don't move.  Don't do anything.  The M 99 will wear off in a few short hours.  Not much time to contain the situation Not much time to protect my simple life.  First, for good luck let me see your neck.  I fucking love my job.  Look, I'm gonna go take a lap through the VIP.    She's cute.    Yeah, she's all right.  I could do you both.  That's the sixth girl that's hit on him.  Let's focus on camera three.  That guy, is he hooked up with the Fuentes brothers? Hey, I'm gonna stay on Quinn.  He may need some backup.  He is supposed to be focusing on the Fuentes brothers.  He's not supposed to be playing with her fun bags.  Sounds like someone's jealous.  Why on God's green earth would I be jealous? Quinn's a good guy.  I'm not interested.  Out there on the dance floor, shaking his tail feathers.  Really not interested.  Stay single as long as you can.    Says the newlywed.    Don't remind me.  You've been married for five minutes.  What happened to the honeymoon phase? I blinked.  Show me where he is.  There was so much blood, I had I had to walk away.  The body's in here.    Anybody see you?   I don't think so.    Oh, God, I hope not.    You killed somebody.    Because you wouldn't do it for me!   But you call me to clean up after you.    I didn't know what to do with the body!   I don't believe this.    Just go if you want to go.    Go? I'm responsible for you.  Everything you do leads right back to me.  I didn't think it would be so hard to kill someone.    Where is he?   Here.  Oh, shit!   He was right here.    Are you sure?   He was dead.    Apparently not.  Don't get mad at me.  This isn't how I was planning to spend my evening.    Me neither.    Would you do me a favour?   What?   Stop talking.  He's lost a lot of blood, at least a pint.  One two.  Three four.  You're a terrible shot, but you never shot a gun before.  You didn't anticipate the kickback One of the many things you didn't anticipate.  Give me the gun.  You must have hit him once.  Where was the point of impact? Where were you standing? He was standing here.  Bam, bam, bam, bam, bam.  I go down, you run away.  I get back up, and where do I go? Here.  Come on! How'd you even find this guy? You can talk now.  The night that I was taken, I had gone to a bar.  I thought that they spotted me there, so I went back to that same bar night after night, hoping that one of them would walk through the door.    I wore a disguise.    Disguise? A wig, so they wouldn't recognise me.  I know what a disguise is for.  So, you went to the bar, you waited for one of them to show up.  Where? What bar? Hurricane 26.  Hurricane 26 is all the way over on Ocean Avenue.  How'd you get all the way out here? That's what I've been trying to tell you.  So, go on.  Tonight one of them showed up.  He didn't know it was me, so I I flirted with him.  I asked him if he wanted to go someplace else.  We got in the car, I pulled out my gun, and I forced him to drive.  This place seemed deserted, so we stopped,   and I marched him inside.    And you shot him.  No.  I asked him for the names of the other men.  He called me a cunt.  Then I shot him.  How'd you know he was one of them? I just I just knew.  You recognise his face? No.  They kept me blindfolded most of the time.  So how? I felt it the minute he walked in the door.  One of the guys had this smell like old sweat or, I don't know, chlorine.  When I got in the car with this guy, there it was, the exact same stench.  You shot someone based on a feeling and an odour.  I shot the right guy.  You were willing to shoot the wrong guy under Tuttle Bridge.  This guy was one of them.    What's his name?   I don't know.  Did you check his wallet?   No.    Did you take his cell phone? He could have already called the police, you know.    I'm new to this!   You don't even know who you shot! I shot one of the creeps who raped me.    You don't have any proof.    I'm the proof! My memory! My experience!   Hardly the most reliable tools.    Fuck you! Fuck me? Wow.  Just go.  I can find him on my own and kill him.  Like you killed him the first time? I have no idea which direction he went, if he turned right or Blood swipe.  He stopped here to catch his breath, leaned against the post, put his hand here.  The directionality of the blood leads which way? This way.  You sure know a lot about blood.  So, hypothetically, an office romance is just the worst idea ever.  Yeah, I would advise against it.  But, hypothetically I can see how you and Quinn make a lot of sense.  So you would advise against it, but it would make a lot of sense? What can I say? I'm a romantic at heart.  Then why don't you patch stuff up with your wife?   It's not that simple.    It is that simple.  Get your head out of your ass, and do something nice for her.  Buy her a card, some flowers.    Get her a puppy.    A puppy? Batista.  Where? Baywater Marina, Warehouse 12.  I'll be right there.    Possible homicide.    I'll get it.  No, I'll go.  This is your baby.  We've been on this for weeks, and had nothing but our asses handed to us, and if for some reason the Fuentes brothers show up tonight, then they've already seen my face, so I'm useless.  And you won't have to see Quinn hitting on other women.    I don't know what you're talking about.    Yeah.  Good luck.  Yeah, you too.  Mmm.  Who are you? No dial tone.  He didn't call anybody.  Who even uses a pay phone any more? People who don't have cell phones.  We caught a break.  But he could have gone anywhere.  What are you doing?   It's luminol.    Luminol? No relation.  The hydrogen peroxide and sodium hydroxide react with the iron present in haemoglobin, and exhibit a blue glow.  See? Why do you have that in your purse? It's not a purse.  And I use this almost every day.    What is it?   Crime Scene.  \"Crime Scene\"? Are you a police officer? \"Baywater Marina, Warehouse 12. \" Isn't that here? Shit.  Somebody did see you.    Oh, fuck!   No, we still have time.  Patrol can't move until Homicide arrives on the scene.  That's at least 15 minutes from now.  How long have you been a cop?   I'm not a cop.    Well, what are you? Complicated.  This way.  Hurry up.  Running pumps the heart faster, and more blood is spilled.  Look here, how the drops are pooling, getting closer together.    He's slowing down?   Yeah.  This way.  This started out as an ordinary day.  In one second, everything changed.  Lumen happened.  Why are you here in Miami? You were getting on a plane to Minneapolis.  I tried to get on that plane.  I couldn't.  I had to stay.  The guy I shot tonight, he would take these three fingers   You don't have to tell and shove them in my mouth! It tasted like metal.  He would keep them there so I couldn't scream.  The other guys would just stuff a dirty rag in my mouth, but not this guy.  He liked to hold me down himself.  I saw everything.  How? You were blindfolded.  Is this your monster? Pardon me, but I couldn't help noticing that you've been hanging out with a fool.  Hmm.    How do you know?   Cos whoever stood you up es un idiota.  I'm Angel.    Yasmin.    My favourite flower.  Ooh.    No? OK.    Mm mm.  Do you want to get out of here, Yasminita? Yeah.  It hurts! Oh, my God! Calm down.  God OK.    What are you doing?   I'm gonna inspect your wounds.  Yeah, one gunshot wound penetrated the abdominal cavity.  Oh, God.    You can't let me die.    Come over here and hold this.  You're gonna save him? I don't know who this man is.  My name's Dan.  Dan Mendell.  This woman right here, she shot me.    I have no idea why.    You know exactly what you did to me! I've never seen this woman before in my life.    You're a fucking liar!   You're fucking crazy! Look, you can't let me die.  I got a wife.  I got a daughter.  Please.  Just look.  \"Dan Mendell, DDS. \" Kids' dentist.    He's a rapist.    I never did anything to you.  We met in a bar, but she came on to me.  And then we get in the car, she pulls a gun on me.    You panicked.    Because you were gonna shoot me.    No, because you recognised me.    I've never seen you before in my life.    You know exactly who I am!   She's crazy.  We got a mental situation going on here.    You, in the corner.    You believe him? She needs help.  This woman needs help.  You're a piece of shit.  Full of shit! Over there.  I have to take this call.  Stay there till I get back.  Don't leave me alone with her! Do not move from this spot.  Help! Everything OK? Die die.  Hi hi, Harrison.  I know you're working, but I thought you might want to take a break.    It's wild hearing him talk.    Isn't it? I put him down, and he was up two hours later talking up a storm, weren't you?  Flies in the buttermilk, shoo, fly, shoo  Here, let me get you on the speaker, and you can sing to him too.   Lost my partner, what'll I do?  Dexter.   Lost my partner, what'll I do?  Skip to the lou, my darling  Well, I don't want to keep you.  I'm afraid to ask, but You want me to stay a few more hours? I'll be home as soon as I can.  There's no place I'd rather be right now.  Die die.  Die die.  I love you.    Who are they?   Get off of me!   What are their names?   I don't know what you're talking Huh? He's a fucking liar! He knows who they are! Who are they?   What are their names?   You are ruining my life! They ruined mine.  If we don't get help, Dan the Dentist is going to expire.  I don't care.  It's what he deserves.  It's what they all deserve.  They should all get He's saying something.  He's talking to someone.  She fucking shot me.  My phone.  Can you hear me? She shot me.  She's alive.  You hear me? That last fucking bitch is alive.  They're gonna find you you cunt.  Die die.  Lumen didn't witness her mother's murder, but she was born in blood.  Like me.  Some experiences are so big they change your DNA.  What now? We clean up.  Homicide will be on us soon.  Hose this area down.  Make sure everything flows through the grate.  Where are you going? To get my car.  We have to move this body.  About time.  Come on.  A hooker called in some gunshots, but didn't actually see the shooter.    Where's the body?   Well, haven't found it yet.  Then what are we doing here? Hey.  Blood.  Bullet holes.  Lots of blood.  A significant amount of blood.  Definitely some sort of homicidal situation here.  A homicidal situation requires a body.  Why don't we let the EMTs handle it? Your average person won't survive this amount of blood loss.  There.  That blood trail there.  See it? Good chance that trail ends at a dead body.    Dexter's en route, but   I get it.  We can't wait.  Will you two guys follow us in, in case this bleeder's alive? Whoa.  This dude is a half litre from dead.    Yeah?   Hey, fuckwad, taking the scenic route? Sorry.  I was with Harrison.  He said his first words \"Bye bye. \"   Yeah? That's sweet.    Yeah, it was.  I remember your first words \"Shoes. \" You were very girly, once upon a time.  That's funny, cos I always remember my first words as being   \"Hurry the fuck up. \"   Almost there.  Masuka and I tracked this dude's blood to a pay phone inside a warehouse.    You did?   I think this way.  Yeah.  We're gonna keep going.    So find us.    Will do.  You changed your clothes.    Here.  This is all I have.    Thanks.  The police are close.  You have to get out of here.  Go to this address.  It's near Kendall.  Say it back to me.  near Kendall.  This'll get you in the front door.  Run six, seven blocks.  Catch a cab.  Get cleaned up and wait for me.  I have it from here.    You want me to go now?   Yes.  No, I'm not leaving you.  Yes, you are.  I can help you move the body.  Who the hell is that? Go, now.  Go! Compartmentalisation is a joke.  Fires rip through buildings all the time no matter how closed off parts of them are.  Life is the same way.  It cannot be contained.  Fuck.  Maybe we should double back the way we came.  Is that? Dexter's car.  Dexter.  You will not believe what I found.  What in the mother of fuck went on in here? I know exactly what happened.  Two words autoerotic mummification.  See, Mr Plastic Man shot Captain Bloody Underpants, while Underpants was in the choke.  Mr Plastic Man has hammocks between Underpants' man chop Thanks to Masuka's keen expertise, Debra will be able to close this case.  Evidence will go into a banker's box and be filed away, eventually transferred to a storage facility in Bradenton, and that is where it will stay, locked away forever in the dark.  If only everything were that simple.  Thank you for the visual.  Asphyxiation heightens the high, but it's not without its risks.  By the way, I wouldn't touch the nozzle of that hose.  Anything to add? The blood is consistent with Masuka's theory.  If there's any follow up, I'd be happy to do it.  We're good here?   You just landed.    I have to relieve Sonya.  Yeah, we're good.  Drive safe.  What a night.  You sure you want to do this? I'm here, aren't I? Angel? This is Yasmin Aragon.  What is she doing on my couch? Miss Aragon is friends with Los Hermanos Fuentes.  She also has a boatload of drug charges against her.  Seems like a trade is in order.  So are we gonna do this or not? Give us a minute.  Excuse me.  I saw that she was wearing a Santa Muerte necklace, so I introduced myself.  If we agree to drop her drug charges, she thinks she can get the Fuentes brothers in the club.  That is if you're willing to give us another chance.  I'm sorry about everything.  About losing my temper, about what I said earlier.  You were right.  Say that again?   You were right.    I like the sound of that.  I did go to IAD because I didn't want my husband disciplined.  I really like being married to you, Angel.  And I you.  It's something I never thought would happen to me because I've been so busy making a name for myself, and now I'm this close to making captain.  And I would never do anything to stop you.  Not on purpose, I know.  But get a stink on you   and I start to stink too.    We'll stock up on deodorant.  Nice job bringing in the girl.  Yeah.  Better than a puppy? I'll see you back at home.  Hello?   Hey.    Hey.  Last one.  Sorry.  You got glitter on your face.  Yeah hazard of the job.  I'm not sure it's in the job description that you have to put your face in Boobie McGee's tits.  Well, you know, the first rule of working undercover is to blend in.  You disappeared.    I did, didn't I?   It's not funny.  Fuck.  I I have feelings for you.    You do?   I tried not to.  I like you too.  Uh More than \"like\".    You do?   Yeah.  I mean, you're the one who keeps putting the brakes on.  Well, what if I don't want to do that any more? That'd make me very happy.  If this is gonna end badly will you please just tell me now? Morgan, I just said I want to be with you.  I mean, what more do you want? Well, I mean, sometimes you mumble, and it's kind of hard to understand you.    Yeah?   Yeah.  How's this? I tried to send this woman and she boomeranged back into the house I shared with Rita.  Lumen? So much for keeping the different parts of my life separate.  Sorry, I'll just be in here.  There are towels somewhere.  I found some in a box.  I also found this robe.  Is it OK if I borrow it? Sure.  The tub's not draining.  Sometimes the thingy gets stuck.  Are you OK? Do you need to sit down? Yeah, for a minute.  I know you.  What you are deep down.  Aside from your police job, and your extracurricular activities.  You're a father.  I saw the pictures out there.  Three children? The two oldest are with their grandparents   their dad's mom and dad.  You have a son? Harrison.  He just started talking.  Today.  He's tremendous.  It's just the two of you? And an Irish superhero nanny.  Never thought my life would turn out like this.  I had imagined a totally different life for myself too.  I always did everything by the book, you know? Go, go, go.  Never stopped to think.  There was high school, and college, and graduate school Owen.  We were gonna get married at the house that I grew up in.  On my wedding day, I I tried on the dress, and I looked out the window at the backyard where the aisle was, and I saw everything that that aisle was leading to.  Babies and matching dinnerware Sunday barbecues.  And I couldn't breathe.  I had to get out of there and find something more.  Then everything happened, and I actually thought, \"This is what I get \"for trying to \"live my own life. \" Do you have any idea what I'm talking about? A little.  But tonight I felt this, like this peace.  And it's because he's dead.  And I know that it's not gonna last.  And when it wears off, I'm gonna have to find the rest of them.  Because that's the only way that I'll find that peace again.  I don't even have a name for what I'm feeling.  I do.  The Dark Passenger.  I can't get revenge for Rita's death, but I can help Lumen avenge what was done to her.  How many more were there?       Previous EpisodeNext Episode"

        "script": "Previously on Dexter You were face to face with Carlos Fuentes, right? So that means he knows that we're onto him.  Tell me why they would ever return to this club.  You have one more night at Club Mayan.  Make something happen.  This is Yasmin Aragon.  If we agree to drop her drug charges, she thinks she can get the Fuentes brothers in the club.    Hey.    I thought you might want a debriefing before we hit Club Mayan.  Um It's sort of not a good time.  This is Stan Liddy.  You are boning our target's sister? Just tell me what you found out on Dexter Morgan.  You fucked everything up, Boyd.  Boyd Fowler.  Hobbies     self improvement   Take it! and storing women in formaldehyde.  Every one of these barrels has a body in it.  Boyd wasn't the only one who did this to me.  There were others.  I shot one of them.  Dexter, what do I do? That last fucking bitch is alive.  They're gonna find you.  Some experiences are so big, they change your DNA.  I'm gonna have to find the rest of them, because that's the only way that I can feel this peace again.  I can't get revenge for Rita's death, but I can help Lumen avenge what was done to her.  How many more were there? It's been over a month since I freed Lumen from Boyd's, but she's still reliving it every day.  Hey.  I brought food.  Oh.    Have you eaten?   I ate this morning.  Well, now it's night.  Eat some more.  You're very controlling.  I need to be.  So, what else? Details would help.  Besides the ones that we've already taken care of   there was Watch Guy.    \"Watch Guy\"? I would be tied to a chair blindfolded.  Sometimes I didn't even know if he was there, until I'd hear this watch by my ear.  And then he'd lean in and whisper \"Tick tick tick.  \"That's the sound of your life running out. \" OK.  Anyone else? Suit and tie.  He'd take off his jacket and fold it very carefully, and then lay it on a chair, like he didn't want to mess it up.  The Suit Guy, I'd know.  He always took the blindfold off.  I guess he thought I'd be dead soon.  He was wrong.  Los barriles.  S\u00c3\u00ad? So, what do we do now? How do we find them? I'm not sure \"we\" is the operating word here.  What are you talking about? We're doing this together.  Lumen, what I do, I do alone.  I don't need a partner.    I said I'd help you, but   Fine.  Forget it.    \"Forget it\"?   There's no point to it, then.  You want these men brought to justice? Yeah, and I can't go to the cops because of you.  So you're gonna have to be a little flexible here.  I want to be a part of this.  We'll see.  Gracias.  I need to get home to Harrison.  Right.  The other part of your life.  There is no other part to Lumen's life.  This is all she has.  Even so, I can't bring her into my world.  There's no place for her.  Dexter? Thank you.  I feel like I'm dropping off my prom date except this is my house, and my wife is dead, and I have no idea where Lumen fits into my world, and this is all so weird exactly like my prom.  Our level of national debt is unsustainable.  I want you to fight against a dystopian society where independent producers are weighed down by parasitic non producers, a Democratic President and a Democratic Congress.  You're just in time.  Hey, good night, buddy.  Saint Brigid, circle us with your light, so that no darkness shall overcome our world.  Sleep well, little one.  That's either a saint, or the most boring action figure I've ever seen.  Is that yours? It's Saint Brigid.  To watch over you while you sleep.    Good night.    Good night.  He doesn't need Saint Brigid.  He has Father Dexter.  Why are you up so early? Gym.  But how about it, you know? I mean, we don't have to live here.  We could get a new place, together.  Morgan.  I'm Homicide.  I don't do traffic accidents.  Whoa, uh Text me the address.    What's up?   Dead people.  You're gonna get the same call.  We're all getting called in.  Why didn't you tell them I'm here? Because I'm not here.  Basically, nobody knows we're seeing each other.  I just want to keep it that way.  Wow, baby.  You say the sweetest things.  Can we at least drive in together? Yeah, and then we'll go to Disney World, and we'll ride all the roller coasters, and we'll hold hands! I don't even know what that means.  Whatever it is it's big.    Dexter.    Hey, Sergeant.  What have we got?   You haven't been listening to the news?   Uh Weather channel.  High pressure system coming in.  What have we got? We got her, and her and her, and her and her.  The girls in the barrels   how could this be? Someone tried to move them.  Where's the driver? That's what we're trying to figure out.  He took off.  Go do your thing.  It's the blood guy, but we got no blood.    We don't know what we've got.    Yeah, what is this gunk? It's formalin   liquid formaldehyde.    Why?   An embalming agent.  Because it was only applied topically, the internal organs of the cadavers continued to putrefy and leak out of the various bodily orifices, becoming congealed once they came in contact with the formalin.  That's what's on your shoe   congealed organ.  What kind of sick fuck are we dealing with? I'm just the blood guy.  We've got five victims, all female, all blonde, all between the ages of 20 and 35, I'm guessing.  They're covered in bruises, contusions, whip marks.  Looks like they went through some special kind of hell.  We'll get fingerprints off them once we get 'em to the ME's office.  I heard the driver took off.  Yeah, we've got the guy that hit him.  He was drunk off his freaking ass.  He said he saw some guy jump out and start running, but that's as detailed as his description gets   \"Some guy. \" That means he's still mine to find.  Or Vince Masuka's.  Hey.  Hey, Dex.  That's some pretty crazy shit, huh? Yeah, crazy shit.  What do you got? Uh One men's suit jacket, size 40.  Did you fold it, or was it already like that? I bagged it as I found it.    I also got fingerprints galore   Excellent.  Except for the steering wheel.  Somebody gave it a quick wipe.  I'll get the vehicle back to the lab, and we'll give it a more thorough going over.  Right.  So much for keeping my lives separate.  Yeah, what's up? What you doing, boy? Sleeping late? Your buddy, Dexter Morgan   you asked me to keep an eye on him.  Yeah? And? Well, he's got some cutie up at his house.  He even took down the \"for sale\" sign.    What's this girl look like?   Blonde, average height, late 20s.  Slim, pretty? That'd be her.    Find out who she is.    You betcha.    What are you doing here?   I saw the news.    I knew what it was.  I had to come.    No, you didn't have to come.  Dexter, I was supposed to be one of those girls.  Look, it's not safe for you here.  They could be watching.  What is this?   What does it mean?   It means they're on the run.  You need to go.  Will you give me Thank you.  Shit a brick and fuck me with it   you're never gonna guess who this truck is registered to.  Jordan Chase.  Jordan Chase is a very smart guy.  His first book made me realise how I'd been putting all these limitations on myself.  I mean, I've listened to all his CDs.  So did Boyd Fowler.  You think Jordan could have been driving that truck? What? No way.  First off, that jacket is nice, but not that nice.  Jordan wears nothing but the best.  That's part of his thing.  \"If you think you deserve something, then take it. \" I've lifted two dozen fingerprints, and they all seem to belong to the same person.  And whoever they belong to, he's not in the AFIS database.  Dead end.  Ooh a hair.  And another one.  It's not often I'm in competition with my own people, but getting the identity of the driver of the truck, and getting to him before they do is the only way I can give Lumen what I promised.  All I get is a fucking computer.  I can order Jordan Chase books, I can order Jordan Chase CDs, but I can't talk to an actual person.  Jordan Chase is a really popular man, you know? He travels the world giving his little touchy feely seminars.    He's probably not even in Miami right now.    I've left messages all over.  If I don't hear back soon, I'm gonna kick their door in.  What about you? Anything? Yeah, we've ID'd two of the girls off their fingerprints.  One was a schoolteacher from Wisconsin.  She came out here on vacation two years ago   never heard from again.  The other one worked on a cruise ship that was docked here.  She disappeared just over a year ago.  Wow.  Yeah, these were good girls, you know? One was 26, one was 29.  Nothing on the other three? No, I'm going through the missing person databases, put their photographs out there.    DNA?   It's being run now.  Looking for direct hits and familial hits.  Listen, I heard about this two bedroom place on Brickell   upper unit, right on the water.    Thought we could take a look.    This is not a workplace conversation, so please just shut up.  All I'm saying is, is this place is going fast.  Listen, please   just not here.  You two.  Now.  Shit.  Think she knows about us?   Is this about   The Santa Muerte case.  Oh.    I thought that was dead.    Well, now it's alive, barely.  Yasmin Aragon, the associate of the Fuentes brothers that Sergeant Batista identified, has assured us that she will bring Carlos and Marco into Club Mayan tomorrow night.    So we're on?   We are on.  I am personally overseeing this operation.  We can't risk word leaking out to the Fuentes, so it's strictly on a need to know basis.  Rather than flooding the club with police personnel, we will be performing a small surgical operation.  We will take the brothers into custody before they get into the club.  Detective Morgan, you'll be with me in the surveillance van.  Detective Quinn, we're gonna post you inside the door of the club with Officer Manzon.  I will be roving, placing myself wherever I believe most effective.  If we're gonna take them outside, shouldn't we be outside? In order not to stand out like sore thumbs, we will continue with the posts we've already established.  Thank you, Detectives Morgan and Quinn.  That'll be all.  Maria, let me make myself very clear.  You've wasted more than enough time and money on this case already.  You're supposed to be a master manipulator of the press, but you haven't even been able to do that.  Every day I pick up the paper, read another story about how we're not doing our job.  Get it right this time, or we're gonna have an interesting conversation about your future.  Where are we with Jordan Chase? I've got Quinn on it.  We've made numerous calls to his organisation, but we haven't been able to reach him personally just yet.  He could be playing hard to get.  In that case, we'll pay his office a visit to see if Probably won't be necessary.  Jordan Chase.  Hi.  Holy shit, that's him.  Nice to meet you.    Nice to meet you.    You too.  Mr Chase? Oh, Mr Chase   Stand back.    I, um I took one of your seminars at the Beach Club a while back.  Sure.  In Palmetto Bay.    You remember?   Of course I do.  You have to excuse Cole here.  He, uh, keeps the crazies away.  Why don't you let me get a picture of you two? Oh, yeah.  Excellent.  OK.  All right, smile.  Oh.  One more.  Got it.  Jordan Chase.    Dexter Morgan.    Nice to meet you.  Nice watch.  Oh, uh, my dad gave it to me when I was a teenager.  It's water resistant to 100 metres.  I have no idea why I would ever need that, but it sure looks nice.  If that's the watch that Lumen heard, I'll make sure it accompanies you to the bottom of the Atlantic.  Mr Chase.  You must be the person in charge around here.  I was in Jacksonville, got an early call from Cole here, my head of security, saying one of our trucks had been stolen out of our lot, and that it just might be the one we'd all been watching on the news.    I flew back as soon as I could.    I see.  We found an article of clothing in the vehicle.  My jacket.  It's my personal vehicle.  I always leave my things inside.    And the keys?   The keys? Yeah, we found the keys in the ignition.  There are a lot of ways to steal a car.  Most thieves don't have the actual key.  I leave a spare set of keys on a hook inside our office.  All my guys know where to find them, in case they need the truck.  Honestly, they're just sitting there.  Anyone could have grabbed them.  And you're Head of Security? Yeah, Cole.  I might have to tighten things up a bit.  Mm? I want to make it very clear that the Miami Police Department has my full cooperation.  My organisation is completely open to you.  This is a horrible, horrible tragedy.  Please, anything I can do to help facilitate its resolution Well, thank you, Mr Chase.  First, we're gonna need fingerprints and hair samples from all your employees, starting with Cole.  Absolutely.  And if I could ask one favour? I'd appreciate it if my name and organisation wasn't released to the press.  Being connected to this in any way would be a PR nightmare.  I'm sure you understand.  As long as we have your continued cooperation, that shouldn't be a problem.  Sociopaths can't feel psychic pain, but they can feel physical pain.  Ow.  Sorry.  What do you think about Cole? \"It wasn't me, \"someone stole my vehicle. \" The oldest excuse in the book.  Still, it does happen.  And Mr Chase is very high profile, well respected.  It's hard to imagine someone like him, or his people, would be involved in something like this.  I took a few hairs from the headrest of the truck as well.  If someone else was driving, he'd have left some evidence behind.  And? Cole's hair matches the hair on the jacket and the headrest.    Fingerprints?   They're all Cole's, even on the ignition key.  I think he's just become the focus of our investigation.    And Jordan?   His alibi holds up.  He was in Jacksonville.  So for now, we got our eyes on Cole.    Lumen?   Dexter you need to announce yourself.  I don't know who's coming in.  But it's OK to have packages delivered here? I need things.  You said not to leave the house.  And what are you gonna do with that? It's just a flashlight.  You have a way of bending the rules.  What's going on with the case? Do you know this man? Oh, my God.  That's him.  That's the guy who folded his jacket.    How did you find him?   He found us.  His name's Cole Harmon.  He's Jordan Chase's head of security.  What about him? No, I I mean, that guy's clearly a freak, but I don't know him.  No, not the bald guy.  The guy beside him.    Jordan Chase.    Oh.    No, I don't know him either.    You sure? I told you, I didn't see most of their faces.    Who is he?   He's some sort of motivational speaker.  This guy I definitely know.  What next? Well, there's a problem   the homicide team is on this.  They'll probably arrest him within the next few days, and once that happens, Cole will never see the outside of a prison cell again.  What about the other guys? In order to save his own skin, he'll probably turn them in.  It's only a matter of time before they're all in the hands of the police.  But this is Florida.  We execute here.  These men will be brought to justice.  You can walk away from all of this now, put it behind you.  You can go on with your life.  No.  That's not what I want.  I promise you, the police will take care of it.  No, I don't want the police to take care of it.  I I want to take care of it.  I know how she feels.  It's not so different from me.    How much coffee are you drinking?   A lot.  I have to stay awake.  What if they come for me at night? She's stressed, on edge   the way I feel when I've gone too long without putting someone on my table.    You said you'd help me.    I did.  I just don't know that helping you kill someone is actually helping you.  This is all I think about.  Don't back out now.  This is important to me.  Truth is, I actually want to help her for some very complicated reasons.  If we want Cole for ourselves, I have to derail the police investigation, which means giving them another suspect.  Who? The man who actually killed all those girls.  Boyd Fowler.  Here, put these on.  First thing we have to do is remove any evidence that you were ever here at Boyd's house.  If the police find your fingerprints or anything that ties you to this place, they're gonna want to know what your relationship to Boyd Fowler is.  How you got here.  How you got out.  That's where you first found me.  We need to go up.  You OK? I'll be with you.  Oh, God.  You OK? We can leave.  No.  He kept me tied up over there.  I don't know how long I was here.  Maybe a couple days.  All I know is that he brought me here to kill me.  I'm guessing that was his job.  He was the finisher.  The last day, I chewed on that rope for hours.  I was finally able to slip it off.  That's when I went downstairs, and I saw you Do what I did.    Is that it?   Yeah.  I just need something of Boyd's to plant in the truck from the accident.  His wallet.  How did you know that was there? I put it there.  Hold the fucking phone, everyone! I was giving Cole's truck another quick once over, and I found something that our blind as fucking bats lab geeks missed.  What have you got? A wallet.  He probably had it sitting on the console, and then it went flying when he got hit.    I found it under the seat.    Cole's wallet? No, that's just it.  It's not Cole's.  Whose is it? Boyd Fowler's.  Who the fuck is Boyd Fowler? I'm going upstairs.  Check it out.  There are locks of hair in here, numbered one through twelve.  Twelve? Jesus.  Well, I'll run DNA on all the hair samples, and match it to the victims.  The guy that did this Died exactly where you're standing.  Hey.  In here.  The same exact barrel the girls were in.  Jesus.  What'd he do with these? The preliminary medical examiner's report said all the girls were electrocuted.  We're gonna need Forensics in the attic.  I think he kept the girls up there.  It looks like Boyd Fowler has become our primary focus.  Do you know this man?   No.    Well, he knows you.  He has all your books and CDs in his house.  Uh I've sold over a million copies of my book, almost as many CDs.  I'm just trying to figure out how he came to be driving your truck.    Well, I'm sorry, but   I know him.  Boyd Fowler.  He was one of your stalkers.  And how come I'm just now hearing this? No reason to tell you about every nut that passes through.  He never seemed like a serious threat.  He took a few seminars a while back, and then started showing up at our office asking for Mr Chase.  I had to escort him off the premises a few times.  He was clearly a bit off, but, uh he never struck me as dangerous.  He's dangerous.  He'd been in and out of our offices enough times.  Probably saw where I put the keys.  When's the last time you had contact with him? Haven't seen him for a while.  Couple of months, maybe.  Any idea where he might be? No.  We have a warrant for his arrest.  I suggest that you be especially cautious, Mr Chase, because if he has a thing for you, you could be in danger.  Noted.  Now, if you have any contact with him, please get in touch with us immediately.  This guy is very bad news.  I will.  Thank you for coming in.  I appreciate it.  You finally did something right.  Steering the cops toward Boyd   very smart.  It wasn't me.  Daddy's going to Boca Raton tonight.  Cos that's where Cole Harmon lives.  He's a bad man.  I'm gonna try to find out who the rest of his bad man friends are.  You want that? Hi.  There's my angel.  Let me just set my things down.  Wonder how much longer I'm gonna be able to talk to you like this.  Soon you're gonna start to understand me.  Harrison clearly loves his Saint Brigid.  He put it with his favourite toys.    I put that in the toy box.    Sorry? It's just a statue of a lady who died a long time ago.  She doesn't protect anybody, or anything.  I should get to work.  Here.  Go to Sonya.  It's just this can be a very dark world at times, and since dear Brigid has always been a comfort to me, I thought Harrison might feel the same.  I hope for his sake, you'd reconsider.  Sure.  Bye, buddy.  So, uh What are you wearing tonight? To the big stakeout? Um A diaper, probably.  I'll have to sit in that van with Batista for hours.  Will you please not wear that awful shirt with the patterns all over it? It really makes me dizzy.  No, I, uh only wore that as a joke.  Oh.  Hey, uh, I got to go.  I'll see you later tonight.  OK.  Hey.  Well, look at you, pretty as a picture.  I only got a few minutes, so what do you got for me? I don't work for free, Quinn.    Well, I just gave you 500 bucks.    And I told you about the girl.  But if you want to find out who she is, where she's from, and what she's doing in that damn house, I might have to employ some methods just a little bit unorthodox.  And for that, you're gonna have to pay.    I don't know.    I know you got the cash.  Yeah, it's not that.  It's the pussy.  Now, looky here, stud, if you're backing off this thing cos you're porking that guy's sister, I'd say you've got your priorities as a cop all wrong.  I'm a little embarrassed for you.  I'll give you another five.  That'll work.  You don't have to do anything with this, OK? You can just talk normally.  What do I have to do? We're gonna walk you through the club, so that our team can get a visual on you, and then you're just gonna wait by the door.  The second you see the Fuentes brothers, you walk up to them, and you engage in conversation outside of the club, until we move in and take 'em.    What am I supposed to say?   Tell 'em how hot they look.  You really don't have to worry about anything.  We're gonna be right there.  I'm gonna make sure we're all in contact.  This is Sergeant Batista.  Is everybody getting this?   Loud and clear.    I can hear you.  Looks like we're all in place.  OK.  You'll do great.  They're already here.  Say again? I said, they're already here, sitting at the VIP table.  OK, how'd that happen? I thought we had all the doors covered.  I don't know.  I heard there's a secret door from the club next door, but I've never seen it.  OK, this is a change of plans.  Yasmin, go sit with them.  We're gonna sit tight until they leave.  Once they step outside the club, we take them.  Let's make sure we find that secret door, and deploy a team there as well.  Everyone got that?   Got it.    Got it.  We've been here for over an hour.  I know.  Well, you said there's a seminar in Naples.  Don't you think he's there? Probably.  So, what are you waiting for? That.  The neighbour to go to bed.  I'm going in.  No, you're staying here.  What? No.  Yes.  It's too dangerous.  I have no idea what's inside there.  I'm gonna have my hands full without watching over you.  Fine.  Well, you can be the lookout.  It's so great working with you.  If you see anything, call me.  We are starting to look a little obvious.  I am gonna go get us a club soda.  All right, yeah.  Oye, mami.  Ven aqu\u00c3\u00ad.    He's calling me over.    No, keep moving.  Ignore him.  This is Lieutenant LaGuerta.  Officer Manzon, go to him, make nice, and try to get him to step outside the club.  Lieutenant, no.  This is a problem.  These guys are dangerous.  Stand down, Morgan.  She's in charge.  Nothing we can do.  Police! Drop that fucking gun! Holy fucking shit! Move, move, move! Stop right there.  Down on the ground.  Police! Drop the gun!   Back away!   Drop the gun now! Oh, you again.  You should walk away before this one gets more than just a little cut.  Drop the gun right now.  Please! You OK? Yeah.  It's OK.  Come here.  Cole as a teenager.  Who the fuck are you? No fucking way! Who are you, motherfucker? We have to go before he sees our faces.  Holy shit! I can't believe that just happened!   What made you come inside?   I thought I saw a shadow.  And that made you come crashing through a window? I know.  I know.  I just had a feeling.  It was some sort of lizard brain thing.  She's starting to sound like me.    That's Cole.    And Boyd.    And Dan the Dentist.    It's them from, like, 15 years ago.  Do you recognise any of the others? No, just those three.    What does this mean?   I don't know.  They've known each other since they were kids.  Oh, my God, Dexter.  This is huge.  We just have to figure out who they are.  So, what do we do next? What? You said \"we\".  Put on your seat belt.  This is a fucking disaster.  Carlos Fuentes was shot and killed.  Our informant, Yasmin Aragon, was shot and killed,   as well as another innocent bystander.    Son of a bitch At this point, we don't know if it's by our gunfire, or that of the two brothers.  Additionally, three other bystanders were wounded.  I want a full report by 8:00am.  I know it looks bad   and it is bad.  But we are going to get through this, I promise you.  In the heat of battle all cops make occasional mistakes in judgment.  Excuse me? If mistakes were made, they most certainly were not mine.  He was so relaxed and happy, I couldn't bear to move.  And I have to admit, he feels quite good.  He's always so happy in her arms.  Partners come to us in various ways, bound together for many different reasons.  But for any partnership to work, you must not only accept this person into your life, but accept her for who she is.  Saint Brigid circle us with your light, so that no darkness shall overcome our world.    Hey.    Hey.    Hi.    Hi!   Harrison, this is Lumen.    Hi.  Oh, my goodness.  Hello.  Sometimes partners find us, and as much as we try to push them away, they work their way into our lives regardless, until we finally realise how much we need them.      Previous EpisodeNext Episode"

Stand down, Morgan.  Drop the gun now! Our informant, Yasmin Aragon, was shot and killed.  This is a fucking disaster.  If mistakes were made, they most certainly were not mine.    I just gave you 500 bucks.    And I told you about the girl.  But if you want to find out who she is, where she's from, and what she's doing in that damn house, you're gonna have to pay.  Boyd wasn't the only one who did this to me.  There were others.  Besides the ones that we've already taken care of, suit and tie.  He'd take off his jacket and fold it very carefully, like he didn't want to mess it up.  Someone tried to move the girls in the barrels.    Where's the driver?   He took off.  That means he's still mine to find.  You're never gonna guess who this truck is registered to.  Jordan Chase.  Nice to meet you.  Do you know this man? That's the guy who folded his jacket.  His name's Cole Harmon.  He's Jordan Chase's head of security.    That's Cole.    And Boyd.    And Dan the Dentist.    It's them from, like, 15 years ago.  What does this mean? We are born primal.  Conceived with the impulse to fight for what we desire.  It's written in our genes.  It's engraved in our souls.  But we've traded the wilderness for pavement, trees for skyscrapers.  We've lost touch with our instincts, with what we are.  We have fallen from nature's grace.  But we shall be delivered! It's time to tap into your primal selves and seize the power of instinct.  We're gonna cast off those shackles that bind us to jobs we hate, people we don't love, lives that aren't worth living.  We are going to Take it! I've never been around so many people that made me feel normal.  Yeah! Yeah! Really normal.    The power of risk!   Take it! The power of desire.  Take it!   The power of instinct.    Take it! Instincts are all I've ever had.  Cole Harmon, Chase's chief of security   torturer, rapist, killer.  It's time to tap into my primal self.  The power of life! Take it!   We're gonna take it!   Take it!   Take it! Take it!   Take it! Take it! All right.  Lieutenant LaGuerta! Multiple rounds were fired at the recent Club Mayan shootout.  Was Miami Metro responsible for the deaths of innocent bystanders? I have nothing to say at this time.  Excuse me.  Do you agree with the Mayor? Did this operation needlessly put people at risk? Every undercover operation is high risk.  Is there going to be an independent investigation?   No comment.    Have you personally retained counsel? Counsel? Isn't it true the victims' families have filed a civil lawsuit? Let me through.  Excuse me, let me through.  Lieutenant LaGuerta, neither confirming nor denying Miami Metro's culpability in the recent Club Mayan shootout.  As we know, two innocent people are dead, six Did ballistics come in? Good news.  Bullets from the victims' bodies belong to the Fuentes brothers, not us.  That is good news.  But this is far from over.  I'm sure you heard the Mayor's statement.  A prime example of how shit just rolls downhill.  He should have kept his mouth shut until all the facts came out.  He was right.  This operation was too risky.  And now because of us, two innocent people are dead.  Not by our bullets.  Shots would have never been fired if we hadn't been set up in that club.    Those are the facts.    On the upside, Carlos Fuentes is dead.  None of us should have any illusions.  There are gonna be consequences.  Yeah, I've seen that look on her face before.  Someone's about to get bent over and fucked.  It's gonna be me, isn't it? I screwed up.  No, you didn't.  You were following orders.  LaGuerta's orders, just like the rest of us.  That's what you put in your report, right? You were following her lead? I haven't written it yet.  I'm still sorting through the events in my mind.  Sorting through what exactly? What I'm gonna say about them.    Here's a crazy idea.  How about the truth?   Deb, I'm on it.    Who's that?   It's Yasmin's mother.  You all right? Three people are dead, Carlos Fuentes and two girls.    Nobody's crying about Carlos.    Fuentes was a scumbag.  Yeah, he's a scumbag that I shot and killed.  And? What's the problem? Don't tell me you feel bad about killing him.  I don't.  That's the problem.  Yasmin didn't feel any pain.  She died instantly.    I'm ready.    OK.  I have some bad news for everyone.  You're all going to die.  Some of us sooner than others.  And if you're not in touch with your primal self, you're already dead.  You may be breathing and walking around, but you're an empty shell, just one of the herd, completely unaware of what you truly want.  And when we come back, we're gonna start using your instincts to design the life that you deserve, fuel the passion to make it real, and find the power to take it.  Jordan Chase's Take It Now Experience will resume at 2:00pm.  In the meantime, we invite you to visit our vendors.  Jordan promises change, but he also accepts credit cards.    Lumen?   Can you talk? Or are you about to have a major life revelation? No, that came around 9:00am, when I realised I really wanted a doughnut.  What'd you find? I haven't been able to find out how these guys know each other.  The picture was taken when they were teenagers, but Did you check high schools? Cole went to Westland Prep in Hialeah, and Dan the Dentist went to St Joseph's Academy in Coral Gables.  Boyd There's nothing on Boyd.  Yeah, he probably never saw the inside of too many classrooms.  I was able to find out something else about Cole.    What?   He was in the Marines.  He got bounced on dishonourable discharge.  He beat up a superior officer and put him in the hospital.  This is a dangerous guy, Dexter.  Do you remember the marks I had on my back? That was Cole.    So be careful.    Are you getting any rest? I fall into a deep sleep from 1:00 to 1: 15 every morning.  When this is over, I expect to sleep for a year.  I'll talk to you later.  Mr Morgan.  Cole Harmon.  I'm sure you remember me from our visit to the station.  Mr Chase spotted you from the stage.  He's very interested in speaking with you.  He was wondering if you'd join him in his suite for a few minutes.  Uh OK.  When? How about right now? All the way to the end.  I'm disgusted, to tell you the truth.  You haven't been listening to a word I've said.  Call me back when you stop being a piece of furniture.  Sorry.  New client.  Good to see you again, Mr Morgan, especially under better circumstances.    Call me Dexter.    Jordan.    Can I offer you a drink?   Uh No, thanks.  I'm good.    Think I know why you're here.    You do? You're searching for a way to cope with your loss.  I know your history, Dexter.  I thought I recognised you when we met at the station, but it hit me later on.  Your wife was murdered.    Yes.    Are they any closer to catching Trinity? Not that I'm aware of.  I followed that case very closely.  Trinity, a religious man, a family, good life.  Yet he was working through such rage, harbouring so many secrets.  I have to be honest.  He fascinated me on a deep level.  What else do Jordan and I have in common? I certainly don't mean to imply any sympathy for him.  He's a monster, no question.  I can't imagine your frustration, knowing he's out there, unpunished.  It hasn't been easy.  No doubt.  And now you're a single father, which has its own set of challenges.  Why did you want to see me? I've developed a theory on how the primal self deals with tragedy.  I have to prepare for the next session, but I am very interested in what happened to you.  I would like to discuss your situation in depth at another time if you're open to that.    OK.    OK.  By the way, have you made any progress on Boyd Fowler? I'm not really aware of all the details.  You should probably speak to one of the detectives.  Of course.  I look forward to our next talk.  There's a little something in there for Harrison.  Thanks.    You wanted to see me?   Close the door.  You know there's a lot of heat coming down on us, and the public's demanding blood, our blood.  Matthews wants someone's head.  Sounds like Santa Muerte's catching on.  I'm putting Cira Manzon on disciplinary leave.    What?   I need to put a face on it.  What's wrong with your face?   Detective   You can't pin this on her.    Her actions precipitated the shooting.    She wasn't even supposed to be there.    I tried to take her off, you wouldn't let me.    That's your impression.  No, that's what happened.  Look, I was the detective in charge, so if you want to fuck somebody over, here's your scapegoat.  I know your instinct is to take the fall for your team.  You were on my team.  In fact, you fuckin' took over my team, and I had your back, cos your team, my team, whatever, it's all the fuckin' same.  Cira's just starting out.  Her career will take the smallest hit.  She'll recover quickly.  If something like that had happened to me back then, I never would have made detective.  We were all there together.  So why can't we just hold tight and weather the fuckin' storm together? Fuckin' think about it.    Does your printer ever work?   Lu? Owen.    How are you?   Um Um I bet you're tan.  The sun feels closer here, even though I know it actually physically is not, it feels like it's right there.  You're in Miami? I got a sunburn just renting the car.  I came to see you.  You did? Lu, I've respected your wishes.  Since the day of the wedding, I haven't called, emailed, I haven't even texted.  It's like my life stopped that day when you left, and I need to get unstuck.  I feel the way to do that is to see you, face to face, without 75 of our closest friends and family staring at us.  Please, will you see me? I   I can't tonight.    Tomorrow.  Lu? I'm staying at the Blue Pelican Motel.  There's a caf\u00c3\u00a9 across the street.  Meet me there tomorrow at noon, OK? OK, noon.  Hey.    Hey.    I got you some supper.  Hot and sour soup, fried rice with tofu.    That's what you like, right?   Yeah, that's fine.  No, I'm not staying.  Oh, right.  Harrison.  You're tired.  I spent the entire day staring at that laptop, and I got exactly nowhere.  Well, the good news is you won't be on that computer tomorrow.    I have something I need you to do.    What?   Shopping.    What kind of shopping? Supplies.  We have to make a room where Cole will be dispatched.  It has to be covered in plastic.  So does Cole.  To catch the blood.  I made a list.  Duct tape, 30 yards of clear polyethylene sheeting.  And garbage bags, three mil, black.    When are you gonna do it?   Tomorrow.  I booked a room right next to Cole's.  You're gonna do it in the hotel? No choice.  Jordan's next gig is in Sarasota.  He and Cole will be hitting the road right after the seminar ends.  So tomorrow night's the night.  There's a parking lot right on the corner of Fourth and Bay.  Meet me there tomorrow at noon and I'll pick up the supplies.  One o'clock would be better, just so I have enough time to shop.  Sure.  What? A few months ago, I was shopping for a wedding dress, and now I'm shopping for It's crazy, isn't it, how quickly you can get used to the supremely weird? Tell me about it.    Thanks for covering.    No problem.  Sonya just left.  Urgh.  Jordan Chase.  I know you're hurting, so I'll reserve judgment, but I gotta draw the line somewhere.  It was free.  It can't hurt, can it? Maybe I'll come away with something.  Yeah, a really ugly onesie.  I don't know.  If it's working, who am I to poop on your parade? And your day? I've got six mandatory sessions with a shrink coming at me because of Carlos Fuentes.  Feels like a big, fat fucking waste of time too.  I mean, I'd kill that fucktard all over again.  I'd empty a fucking magazine in him.  OK.  Maybe that's something worth talking about.  I always thought if I landed a bullet that it would bother me that it would it would be a burden to take another life.  They don't issue guns to lab geeks, so you have no idea what I'm talking about.  I can imagine.  I don't feel bad.  Me, of all people.  I don't feel anything.  Maybe I've just run out.  Dad once told me that some people deserve to die.  You believe that? You believe some people deserve to die? Some people don't deserve to live.  Trinity should be dead.  Not Rita, not Lundy.  Maybe the world is better off without Carlos Fuentes.  I'd pretty much given up hope.  I figured I was destined to go through life alone, and then I started listening to one of your CDs.  The Primal Self? I started listening in the car on the way to work.  Three weeks later I met my soul mate, and now we have a baby on the way!   Come on up here.    Come on, honey! Cole will be at his post for the rest of the session.  That gives me an hour.  I'll have to do this in the dark.  Fourteen steps to the pillow.  Give him the needle, and drag him to my room.  Sixty seconds tops.  Jordan's about to lose his number one fan.    Sorry.    Oh.  No, no, it's me.  Really.    You look beautiful.    I don't, really.  You do.  You always do.    Miami suits you.    Huh.  You must love all these Art Deco buildings.  Can't get enough of 'em.  Steph had her baby.  Oh, that's right.  She was due last month.  Yes.  Meet Mavis.  Look at her.  Mavis? Mark's grandmother.  The name came down to Mavis or Madison.  Madison? Your niece could have been named after the city where you and I did our Sunday beer runs.  Cooler heads prevailed.  Mine.  How is Steph doing? She's tired, glad to not be pregnant any more, cries at commercials and is transcendently happy.  Your parents miss you.  They'd like to know that you're safe.  You can tell them.  Well, I'm thinking of not going back too.    What?   You were right.  We were trapped in our jobs, trapped in that city.  We'd have been trapped in a life we didn't want.  It's time for that to change.    Owen?   Lu I bought these round the world tickets.  Broke the bank.  We can literally hop on and hop off in any city.  I love you.  No matter what you do, whoever you are, I want to take this journey with you.  Have you met someone? I've met a lot of people here, but not like you're thinking.  I can't just leave.  Me showing up like this is sudden, I know.  We had five years.  Take a night to think it over.  I'm going either way, but I'd rather go with you.  Meet me here tomorrow night and tell me your decision.  God fucking damn it.    What is it?   Un fucking believable.  Lieutenant, will there be any other I don't know who your sources are, but I can confirm that Detective Morgan was in charge of the operation.    Holy shit.    She's blaming everything on me.  Is it true that Detective Morgan has been placed on disciplinary leave? As of today, she's being placed on immediate suspension with pay, pending the results of Whoa! Not the plasma.  Excuse me.  I thought we were actually friends.  Deb, wait.  I can't do it.  I can't let her throw me under the bus and drive over me, then back up a few fuckin' times and drive off.  Oh.  Fuck! Shit! Fuck! Didn't you see me driving up? Didn't you see me backing out? You know, there's a reason why cars have rear view mirrors, lady! I mean, shit, look at that.  This here's fibreglass.  Can't pound that out.  I'm gonna have to pull that whole panel off.  How do I know it wasn't already there? You just hit my car.  I was distracted.  Just let me give you some cash.  No cash! I don't want cash! We'll do this on the up and up, cos that's the kind of guy I am.  We just let the insurance dudes hash this out.  You do have insurance, don't you?   Yeah.    Well, halle fuckin' lujah.  Now, let's just trade some info here and get this sorted out.  Look, now, we can either do this the right way, or I can call up the police, let Miami's finest handle it.    It's your call.    No.  No, no, no.  I The Jordan Chase Experience seminar will resume tomorrow at 8:00am sharp.  Vendors are open tonight till 7:00pm.  How was your day? I guess working for Jordan has its benefits.    Hello?   I'm here.  I'm on my way.  No, I mean, I'm here in the lobby.    What are you doing here?   I got into a car accident.    Are you OK?   Yeah, yeah.  It was my fault.  Actually, no, it was Owen's fault.  Owen who? My ex fianc\u00c3\u00a9.  He's in Miami.  Why? He came to see me.  Don't worry, I didn't tell him anything about anything.  He asked me to go away with him.  Just up and leave all this behind.  As if I could.  You could, you know.  Do you want me to go? If you want to, go.  This is the only part of my life that makes sense any more.    What about Owen?   He's leaving.    When?   Tomorrow.  Stay the night.  The seminar's out for the day, and Cole could be anywhere.  He could see you.  It's too risky to have you walk through the lobby again.  If I stay does that mean you're not gonna kill Cole tonight? No, it's still happening.  We're gonna prepare the room together.  This is all much easier with a partner.  But a partner in what?   Why didn't you tell me?   I was planning to.  I have no idea how the press got hold of it.  Maybe it was because you fucking leaked it.  You'll be a desk jockey for a few weeks, then your union rep will have you reinstated.  This time next year, all will have blown over.  It's just your word against mine and everybody else that was there.  Some people don't agree with your version of the events.  Who'd you get to lie for you? Batista? Batista's gonna back your fuckin' story?   Do I have to go to Matthews with this?   You watch yourself, Detective.  We wouldn't want your reinstatement to be delayed.  God.  I was fucking happy for you when you got married.  I thought that you being with Batista might make you a nicer person.  I never expected you to fuckin' eat him alive.  Cole's other victims.  Why did you put their pictures up? Cole needs to see what he's done.  What do you get out of all this? I like knowing that the men who did this to you won't do it to anyone else.  This isn't about me.    You're standing here.    Look at all this.  If you didn't know me, you'd still be in this room.  Boyd wasn't your first.  You've been doing this a long time.  It's Cole.  We'll wait for him to go to sleep, then you take off and I grab him.  What's that? M 99.  Animal tranquilliser.  Gives me a few hours to wrap his body in plastic and secure him to this desk.  You're gonna kill him while he's still out? No, I'm gonna wake him up, see if he'll give up the other two names of the men in the pictures.  My knife can be very persuasive.  Stay here.  Tie my other arm! Do it now! Yes! Oh.  Oh.  Yes! Oh, God! No.  No! No more! Please! No! Let me go! Let me out of here!   What happened?   You fell asleep.  What about Cole? He's back at the seminar by now.    The screamer spent the night.    So you're not gonna kill him? No, I am.  I've been thinking about it all night.  Cole makes his security rounds at every session.  So I'll wait for him by the service elevator and M 99 him there.  I would have rather grabbed him at night, but I can make this work.    And what about me?   You'll wait until the session starts.  Everyone will be in the seminar.  You won't be spotted when you leave.  Just steer clear of the service elevator.  OK.    I can't believe it.    What? I actually slept.    Hey.  Do you want to get up?   No.  Do you want to go back to sleep?   No.    Do you want to just No, I don't want to do anything.  I just want to lie here.  It's Sunday.  I'm allowed.  LaGuerta's an evil bitch.  No, she's not.  Maybe she is.  The best way to get back at her is to do exactly what she says.  Go on leave, talk to your union rep, get reinstated, then come back and kick as much ass as you possibly can.  No one, not even LaGuerta, can deny that you're a great detective.  At the end of the day, you'll be the one left standing.    At the end of the day?   Yeah, you know, when all is said and done.  Sounds like one very long day.  Hey.    I smell coffee.    Now's not a good time.  Well, it is for me.    Hey, Debra Morgan.    Liddy, right?   Good memory.  I like this one.    This one? You and I got something in common.  We've both been fucked over by LaGuerta.  Well, maybe we should make matching T shirts or something.  OK.  Well, this one's going for a fuckin' breakfast burrito.  I'll see you two later.  Call before you come over.  It's a common courtesy.  Don't you want to know about this girl shacked up with Dexter Morgan? I just staged a little meet and greet with her.  Old PI move.    So you met her.    Name, Lumen Pierce.  Lumen.  Stupid fuckin' name.  From Minneapolis, Minnesota.  Supposed to be married three months ago, picture in the paper and everything.  Just takes off.  Shows up here in Miami one week before your boy's wife, Rita Morgan, is murdered.    Now, what do you think of that?   I don't know.  Is that all you got?   It's a hell of lot more than I had yesterday.    Well, stay on it.    I'd love to, but I am running out of loot.    I just paid you last week.  And I just fucked up my car getting this info for you, Quinn.  Now, this boy is dirty.  What you gonna do about it? I'm not giving you any more.  You know, I thought you and me had an understanding.  I mean, it'd be a shame if the skirt you're boning finds out about all this.    And how would that happen?   I don't know.  Things go wrong every day.  Fuckin' motherfucker! You two are starting to sound more alike every day.  Must be love.  Tragedy.  Many of us here have experienced it in one form or another.  The kind that leaves you wondering if there's a reason to go on living.  For two days, you've heard me talking about getting in touch with your primal self.  But how does the primal self deal with loss? Cole's starting his rounds.  He'll reach the service ele\u00ce\u00bdator in five minutes.  In three minutes, so will I.  There's someone in this room who is dealing with that very question.  Dexter Morgan.  Come and join me onstage, Dexter.  I know you weren't expecting this, but it's important.  Please.  So much for slipping out quietly.    Dexter! They want you, Dexter.    Dexter, Dexter.  Dexter.  Dexter, Dexter.  Dexter, Dexter.  Dexter works with Miami Metro Homicide.  Recently, he lost his wife.  She was murdered by the Trinity Killer.  The very person that Dexter's department was hunting.  You were the one to find her, your wife? Rita? Yeah.  Yes.  I'm gonna ask you to do something, and it's gonna be very difficult.  I want you to relive that moment.  According to the newspapers, you were supposed to be going away on honeymoon? Dexter.  Y Yes.  Tell us about it.  Well, we postponed the honeymoon because we had a new baby, a boy.  Keep going.  Tell me how you found her.  Please.  I'd come home after work.  I remember walking through the house.  I turned the corner and it's like time actually slowed down and then stopped.  It's just a series of pictures.  What'd you see? I saw my son sitting in blood.  He was crying.  So much blood.  And she was there in the tub.  She'd bled out.  Her eyes were still open.  I want you to tell me something, Dexter.  I want you to be very honest.  What did you feel in that moment? We want to know.  It's difficult to put into words.  Everything fell apart.  I felt Shattered? Yes.  When the primal self is shattered, it reaches out in search of what will make it whole again.  Do you feel that, Dexter? That hunger inside you to be whole again?   I do.    That hunger is your primal self.  You must open your heart and listen to what it's saying.    Many people after suffering a tragedy   Mr Harmon? spend the rest of their lives as broken beings Can you sign this, please?  living in the past.  Your primal self is crying out to be whole.  What is it that will make you whole? For some, it's a newjob.  For others, the love of another person.  Your primal self will tell you, but you have to be open to hearing the message.  Are you? Yes.  Then you've just taken your first step toward happiness.  Dexter.  You fuckin' bitch! Not this time.  I'm gonna take this gag out of your mouth, but if you make one sound I don't like, I'm gonna cut your eyes out.  Blink, so I know you understand.  We know about Boyd and Dan the Dentist.  And now you.  Who are the others? The guy who held a watch up to my ear.  \"Tick tick tick.  That's the sound of your life running out. \" What are their names? What did he say? Huey, Dewey, and Louie.  Look at the women whose lives you destroyed.  Look.  Look.  Death was the only kindness you showed them.  It's a shame you can only die once.  You said I'd done this before.  That's true.  This is who I am.  When I was a child, my mother was murdered in front of me, and it shattered me.  I've done this ever since.  Because for the longest time, it was the only way I could feel unbroken.  And then Rita was killed and none of this made sense any more.  Until now.  Miguel couldn't.  My father couldn't.  Can anyone live with the truth of what I am? Is Lumen what will make me whole? Moving in? The Lieutenant said I should bring some of my stuff into this department.  It was you.  LaGuerta asked you to back her story, and of course you did.  Deb.    Deb?   Detective Morgan you're the youngest woman in Miami Metro to ever make detective, and I really admire you, like, a lot.  And I came here hoping to learn from you.  What you did you would never learn from me.  Good luck.  You're gonna need it.  Deb.  I'm gonna do whatever it takes to set the record straight.  I thought you were backing LaGuerta's story.  No, I didn't know what I was gonna do.  I was stuck between a rock and my wife, but I decided I'm backing you.  Might not go over too well at home.  You're flesh and blood to me, like my kid sister, but better, because I actually like you.  Damn.  It's OK.  Yeah.  It's OK.  Most people wait until the seminar is over before checking out.  Uh I lose my nanny in an hour.  I gotta get back to my son.    Is everything OK?   It's nothing important.  Just a little security glitch.  Like your chief of security's head is in my luggage? I want to thank you for coming onstage.  It didn't seem like I had any choice.  I know it was sudden, and you probably didn't appreciate it.  But you'll look back on it, you'll realise it was worth it.  Don't forget what happened here this weekend, Dexter.    I won't.    Act on what you've learned.  Don't let it slip away.  It's what I tell my clients.  Tick tick tick? That's the sound of your life running out.  My primal instincts were right.  Jordan's one of them.    Take it, Dexter.    Oh, I will.  It's a law of physics that elements want to unify.  Single cells in a Petri dish thrash around until they coalesce.  And events in the universe that once seemed random are eventually revealed to have an underlying connectedness.  Jordan Chase is one of them.  I'm sure of it.  \"Tick tick tick. \" But he wasn't in the photo.  Maybe he took the photo, I don't know.  We're gonna take down Jordan Chase? First things first.  Just let go? Just let go.

        "script": "Previously on Dexter   We are going to take it!   Take it! Cole Harmon, Chase's Chief of Security   torturer, rapist, killer.  It's time to tap into my primal self.  Why did you want to see me? I am very interested in what happened to you.  I would like to discuss your situation in depth at another time.  Our informant, Yasmin Aragon, was shot and killed.  This is a fucking disaster! If mistakes were made, they most certainly were not mine.  I can confirm that Detective Morgan was in charge of the operation.  As of today, she's being placed on immediate suspension with pay.  It's just your word against mine.  Some people don't agree with your version of the events.  Who did you get to lie for you? It was you.  Don't you want to know about this girl shacked up with Dexter Morgan? Name   Lumen Pierce.  Lumen.  Shows up here in Miami one week before your boy's wife, Rita Morgan, is murdered.  You fuckin' bitch! Who are the others? The guy who held a watch up to my ear.  \"Tick tick tick.  That's the sound of your life running out. \" It's what I tell my clients.  Tick tick tick? That's the sound of your life running out.  Jordan Chase is one of them.  We're gonna take down Jordan Chase? On a good day, when I run, the voices in my head get quieter until it's just me, my breath and my feet on the sand.  Pick up the pace, Dexter.  Today is not one of those days.  When I scheduled a private session with Jordan Chase, I wasn't looking for advice.  Just proof.  Evidence of exactly how he was involved in Lumen's torture, because the code requires certainty.  Faster, Dex.  I just wanted access to his office, the inner sanctum where I could find clues.  Instead, I'm stuck here, running in place.  Look, I get it.  You're frustrated.  You feel like you're not getting what you came here for.  Yeah, a bit.  Intense exercise works.  Tears down your defences, brings out your feelings.  Well, I have the feeling that I'd be more comfortable talking on a couch.  Trust me, this is the way to build a new you.  At the seminar, we went over how tragedy fractures us, right? Yeah.  We're like Humpty Dumpty and the big fall.  What I'm telling you now is trauma is also opportunity.  Tragedy tears us apart, sure.  But it's your one chance to recreate yourself.  You get to put yourself back together again any way you want.    OK.    Don't be sceptical.  I know it for a fact.  How? What happened to you? You didn't come here to talk about me.  Something big must have happened if it inspired your entire philosophy.  OK, I'll tell you where it started, if you promise to keep it between us.    Plato.    What? The notion of a fractured self.  It's from Plato's Symposium.  You ever read it? Maybe in college.  But you don't remember it, right? Most people don't.  But for me, it was a revelation.  It was exactly what I needed at the time.  So I took it.  I took Plato's idea that we are fractured creatures, trying to become whole, and I ran with it.  Boom, a million copies sold.  So now you know my secret.  You ready to tell me yours? Over your dead body.  An hour on the treadmill, and I came up empty.  Not a clue.  Only upside is I got in my cardio for the day.  Jordan is one tough nut to crack.  You're one tough nut to crack, you know that, Dexter? I wish he'd stop doing that.  We ran for an hour.  You didn't give up anything.  I know you're in killer shape, but you can't outrun me forever.  You have to give me something to work with.  Otherwise how can I help you? Maybe you can't.  Or maybe you can.  Is that blood? No pressure.  It can take several meetings for us to have a real breakthrough.  But I do need your commitment.  I need to get my hands on that vial.  Otherwise, we're just wasting our time.  I really think I can help you, though.  I think so too.  When can I get in to see you again? Check with my receptionist on the way out, I think I may have an opening tomorrow morning.  Well, that was lucky.  He doesn't have anything else for the next two weeks.    Perfect.    See you tomorrow.  I didn't notice you last time.  You new here? Just started three days ago.  I don't remember so much security either.  Mr Chase says he's beefing things up.  That's no surprise.  Lumen and I have been knocking off his friends one by one.  How many security guards? I don't know.  Maybe a dozen.  But you think that you can still get to the blood necklace thing, right? Yeah.  While Jordan's in the shower.    Won't he notice if it's missing?   No, I'm not gonna swipe it.  I'm just gonna extract a sample.  I'll run it for DNA, hopefully get an ID.  Run it for DNA.  God, I love that you can do that.  So whose blood do you think it is? If it is blood.  Most likely a victim.  Whatever it is, it's important to him.  He's wearing it around his neck.  It's definitely some kind of trophy.  Are you there?   Oh, my God.    What? What is it? There's someone at the kitchen door.  They're trying to get in.  Go out the front door.  I'll be there in a few minutes.  Dexter, there's someone there too.    Hide.    Where? In the bathroom.  I'll get there as fast as I can.  What's happening?   They're inside.    What? They're coming! Put the phone down.  Leave the line open.    Jesus!   Who the fuck are you? Who the fuck are you? Who the fuck is she? You wanna try that again, Astor?   Who is she?   Her name is Lumen.  I mean who is she? Why is she here? She's renting the house.    You said the house was empty.    Thought it was.  How was I supposed to know he got a girlfriend so fast? First of all, she's not my girlfriend.  She's a tenant, like I said.  Second of all, who are you? I'm Olivia.  I live near her grandparents.    Anyone wanna tell me how you got here?   Taxi.  It's 215 miles.  From a bus station.    Where'd you get the liquor?   Does it matter? Yeah, I'd say so.  You're 12.  You said you were 14! Thanks a lot.  If you really wanna know, we stole it from my house.  That's reassuring.  I think I need to sit down.  Do your parents know where you are? My mom thinks I'm at Astor's.  And let me guess, your grandparents think you're at Olivia's.  Don't call 'em.  Please.  At least not until tomorrow.  They should really stay the night and sober up.  Then I'll stay too.  With her? Oh I think I'm gonna Here.  Come with me.  I'll get you to bed, OK? Quite a situation we have here.  Unless you have advice on dealing with teenage girls, I don't want to hear it.  My advice? Get Astor out of here.  Tomorrow morning you're collecting evidence on a violent murderer you plan to kill.  You really want a hung over preteen in the middle of that?   She came here.    Drunk! I can't just turn her away.  Dexter, there's a reason serial killers don't have children.  You can't be killer and dad.  Haven't you learned anything? Her mother is dead because of you.  Which is why I need to make things right and be a good father.  A good father would get those girls as far away as possible.  Harrison's still at the apartment with Sonya.  I'm gonna go get him, bring him back here.  Deb.  You're gonna break something.  Relax.  You relax.  You're not about to have the worst meeting of your career.  It's a union rep.  He's on your side.  You know, just be professional and don't freak out until you actually know what's gonna happen.  I know what's gonna happen.  I'm gonna get fired.  No, you're not.  Even LaGuerta said this isn't gonna stick.    I'm supposed to trust her?   No.  But you can trust me.  Everything's gonna be OK.  You know why? Cos you're gonna get your job back.  You got everyone at the station on your side and you got a boyfriend who loves you.  Seriously? You're gonna drop that on me now? It's just an expression.  It slipped out.    I gotta go.    Fine.  Forget I said it.    What?   Good morning to you, too, sunshine.    You alone?   Yeah.  What's up? Your pecker.  Soon as you take a look at these snaps I took of your boy Dexter Morgan and his gal pal on some kind of middle of the night boat run.    Wanna meet for a beer?   It's 7am.  Beer is good anytime.    Yeah.  I gotta work.    Then I'll come to you.  What'd I just say? I can't now! I'll call you later.  You sure you wanna keep your appointment with Jordan? Well, I need to.  There's not gonna be another chance to get the blood.  Besides, it's something I actually know how to do.  You were a teenage girl, right? How do I deal with Astor? Try talking to her.  Last time I did that, she said she hated me and moved to Orlando.  Well, now you get a second chance.  Share something with her What you did when you were her age.  I killed the neighbour's dog.  Well, don't tell her that.    Seriously, what do I do?   Just cut her some slack.  All kids that age make mistakes.  Trust me, the hangover will be punishment enough.  Is that your brother? Harrison.  He doesn't even recognise me.  Well you didn't look like a raccoon last time he saw you.  Eat.  It's hangover food, it'll soak up the alcohol.  Talk to her.  Share something.  So I need to go to a meeting in a few minutes.  But I was hoping after that we could spend the day together, cos we really should talk.  So is that OK? Can Harrison come? Sure.  I'll call the baby sitter, tell her there's a change of plans.  Mama.  I have no idea why he said that.  I barely know him.  Stop lying, OK? I'm not stupid.  She's not your mama.    Your mama's dead.    Astor.  I'll tell you this   if you were the one who died, I really doubt my mom would have brought in a tenant so fast.    I should go.    I know.  It'll only be a couple hours.  I can handle it.  My family is pretty weird too.  Hey.  How'd it go with the union suit? They're sticking me in the file room.  Till after my hearing.  You're not fired.  It's good news.  Yeah, it's great.  Except everybody still thinks I'm responsible for that girl dying and all those kids getting wounded in that nightclub.  For the record, my report backed your story 100 per cent.  Not that it mattered.  The brass backed my wife.  Matters to me.  Thank you.  Anybody needs a real fucking detective, I'll be in the file room.  Detective Scapegoat reporting for duty.  They said you'd be joining me.  Come on.  I can get you started.  Right over here.  So how's it going with that man of yours? This morning, out of the blue, he   told me he loved me.    Oh!   You say it back?   No.  I ran.  What? What's the problem? You don't feel the same way? No, the problem is that   I'm afraid I might.    Oh.  What is this, the barrel girls case?   File it under creepy?   Under closed cases.  Not read, honey.  File.  That's what I get paid to do, and for the next few weeks, so do you.    Good session.    Another hour of running in place.  You seem more open.  You feel the difference? Yeah.  I feel like I might take away something valuable this time.  Hmm.  Good.  Well, I got to tell you.  I still feel like you're not being completely honest with me.  Really? About what? About what you really want.  What I really want Just a drop.  A 30 gauge needle should slide right in undetected.  He won't even notice it's missing.  What do you mean? What you want out of life.  Whatever it is, you have to tell me so that I can help you construct a plan to get there.  I have a plan to get there.  Lumen and I follow this blood trail.  We take you out.  Believe it or not, you're helping me already.  I hope so.  I really do.  Each of us deep down, we know what we really want.  It's just a matter of actually doing it.  Yeah.  I gotta get back to work.  New evidence to process.  But, uh, thanks again for everything.  So when's our next appointment? I'll check with the receptionist.  What did I tell you? You're supposed to be filing things away, not makin' a mess.  Wait, wait.  I was reading that.    Yeah, that's the problem.    Just give me one more second.  Holy shit! Look at this.    What am I lookin' at?   DNA results.  Multiple DNA results.    The barrel girls case?   Mm hm.  We pinned this on one guy and Iooks like there are multiple perps.  I'm just gonna Tell me what you see.  DNA sequencing report, partial sequences on three, maybe four perps? What case is this?   Barrel girls.    Didn't we   Didn't we pin this on one guy?   Yes.  Boyd Fowler.  But the coroner found trace DNA on the girls that wasn't Boyd's.  There were partial sequences from multiple people.  It's all in the file.  Why am I only hearing about this now? Because by the time the final coroner report came through, we'd already closed the case.  The only reason I came across this was because I was filing it all away.  Look.  This is Cole Harmon, our original suspect.  Jordan Chase's security guy.  We let him go.  We got DNA samples on him.  Tell me what you see.  There are enough common markers that Cole Harmon is looking pretty good for the barrel girls' murders.  At the very least, he can't be excluded.  What are you saying, that Cole and Boyd did this together? Yeah.  With maybe three or four others.  We gotta reopen this case.  I know.  But I can't tell LaGuerta.  I'm supposed to be on file clerk duty.  I I'm not tellin' her.  This case was solved.  If I ask her to reopen it, I may as well put my balls in a vice.  And not in a hot way either.  Well, that just leaves me.  Hey.  You're late.  Yeah.  Tough morning.  Astor showed up on my doorstep last night, drunk with a friend.  How old's the friend? Just kidding.  What's that? Blood sample? Yes.  It's a blood sample.  Top secret, huh? I get it.  So what is it? Blood alcohol for Astor? She vomited all over the floor.  Further testing is kind of unnecessary.    STD panel?   Vince, she's 12.  I meant for you.  It's a homicide victim I'm supposed to have processed already.  I made a mistake, forgot to submit it, OK? Morgan.  Dexter, the girls are gone.    Gone where?   I don't know.  But they're missing.  They felt terrible, and we didn't have any Advil in the house, so I took Harrison to the store.    You left them alone?   I was trying to be nice.  When I got back, they were gone.    Maybe they went for a walk.    I don't think so.  The back door is wide open, and their cellphones are still here.  Dexter, what 14 year old girl willingly leaves her cellphone behind?   Don't move.  I'll be right there.    I'm so sorry.    What's going on?   I went to the neighbour's house   to see if he saw anything.    What? Hey.  So I saw some guy near the house.  Uh, light hair, average build, mid 30s.  Like Cole and Boyd and Dan.  Oh, he had a white panel van.  And it was weird enough I checked out the plate.  N4B something.    Why didn't you stop him?   I didn't know the girls were in the house.  I didn't even know you had a tenant.  Just thought he was a painter or something.  Which is why you thought to check the licence plate? Well, no, that's just habit from neighbourhood watch.    Thanks.    Yeah.    What are you doing?   Looking for signs of a break in.  An abduction, that's what we're thinking here, right? Yeah.  But it doesn't make any sense.  It does if someone came looking for us.  Like one of Jordan's guys.  There's a reason you were worried last night when you heard noises in the house.  But I overreacted.  It was nothing.  Only this time there was someone lurking around the house.  I shouldn't have stolen that blood sample.  Not with the girls here.  We need to call the cops.  They'll just start asking questions.  And if it does have to do with Jordan, they'll probably trace it all back to us.    Metro.    This is Dexter Morgan from Homicide.  I'd like to report a probable child abduction.  It's a white panel van.  I have a partial plate.  We've issued a blanket APB on the van.  NCIC has started a file on the girls.  Until we get them back safely, Detective Linker will be our liaison to missing persons.    Did you call Olivia's parents?   I tried.  I couldn't get ahold of them.    What about Astor's grandparents?   They hadn't heard from her.  I didn't tell them she was missing, though.  Didn't want to worry them yet.  Most missing children are abducted by someone the parents know.    Is there anyone you can think of?   No.  Nobody.  You sure? No one new? Where were you, anyway, when they were taken? I can't lie about this.  Not with Astor's life on the line.  I was with Jordan Chase.  He offered me some private sessions to help deal with Rita's death.  What? A lot of fucked up people circling that guy, Dex.  A lot? Who? Besides Boyd Fowler.  Well, his head of security for one.  I thought we cleared him.    May have been premature.    OK what's going on? The barrel girls case might not be as closed as we thought.  Can we just find the van?   Don't move!   Show me your hands!   Whoa, whoa, what's going on?   On your knees! Hands on your head now! Yeah, right there.    Who is he?   Name's Barry Kurt.  No priors.  They found him at a gas station on Coral.    Where's Astor?   Hey easy! If you hurt her, I'll kill you.    I'll kill you.  You understand me?   Get your hands off of me.  He's looking for the girls.  Just like you.    He's what?   I'm Olivia's father.  Sort of, anyway.  I live with her mom.  I'm Astor's stepfather, Dexter Morgan.  Yeah.  You should try to calm down.  He thought something happened to his daughter.  Something is gonna happen to them when I find them.  Olivia broke into our liquor cabinet, stole money from her mother, and took off.  We've got GPS tracking on her mobile phone.  I followed it to your house, but they weren't there.  I figured I'd gas up the van and go back.  Next thing I know, I'm on my knees in cuffs, like some loser on Cops.    So where are they?   Probably causing trouble somewhere.  Ever since Astor moved down the block, Olivia's been nothing but a pain in the ass.  Morgan.  Is he always this violent? They found the girls at Bayside.  They're holding them for shoplifting.  Astor? Thank God.  We had the whole department looking for you.  We were so worried.  You have no idea what you put us through today.  I'm sorry.  What were you even thinking, running off like that?   Shoplifting? That figures.    We didn't steal anything.  I swear.  I just tried on a ring and forgot about it.  It was a mistake.  I gave it back.  I'm Detective Debra Morgan from Miami Metro Homicide.  Mind if I take it from here? Just make sure I don't see these two again.    Come on, we're going home.    No!   Now.    My stuff's at Astor's.  I need to go with her.    You need to come with me.    I don't want to.  Tell you what.  Their stuff is at my house.  Why don't I take them there, get them packed.  We'll meet you in an hour.  You're gonna need to get your van out of Impound anyway.  Which you're paying for, by the way.  We'll meet you at the roadside caf\u00c3\u00a9.  It's right near Impound.  Great.  Teenagers.  They can make you homicidal.  I know what you mean.    You wanted to see me?   Yeah.  You wanna tell me what's going on with you and Detective Morgan? Nothing.  What do you mean? Obviously you've been talking about the barrel girls case.  We found some new evidence.    You and Detective Morgan.    She did.  In the file room.  I was going to tell you.    What?   You really don't see what's going on? I send her to the file room with one assignment   file.  And then she magically finds evidence to reopen a case she knows I personally closed.  Maria it's DNA.  It's not like she made it up.  She's trying to get back at me.  We pinned this on Boyd Fowler.  I had five detectives tell me he's the one.  And now I am telling you that it's more complicated.    You need to reopen the case.    I disagree.  Changing five names on the murder board from black to red isn't gonna help this department.  The department? Or you? What happened? Uh, they were at Bayside.    Oh.  Thank God.    Shoplifting.  You gonna introduce us? That's the one I was telling you about.  His new girlfriend.  She's my tenant.  Lumen, this is my sister Debra.  Deb, Lumen.    I didn't know he had a tenant.    Didn't know he had a sister.  I'm gonna go check on the girls.  Seriously?   That's your tenant?   Yes.  Where's all her stuff? She hasn't really moved in yet.  But you know her well enough to trust her with your son.  It was an emergency.  I thought the girls had been taken.  Why are you keeping her a secret? I'm not.  Really? Cos at the station we asked you who you were spending your time with.  You didn't think to mention the hot blonde that's living in your house? Didn't seem like it mattered.  Obviously, she didn't take the girls.  That's not the point.  I'm not judging you.  Believe me, I understand rebound as much as anybody.    But don't you think it's a little soon?   I'm not on any rebound.  Come on.  She's your tenant?   Really?   There's nothing going on.  Fine.  I give up.  I gotta get back to the station.  Deb knows about my partner in crime.  The whole station knows I'm seeing Jordan Chase.  This is not my day.  Astor! Just stay cool.  No matter what.  You want to tell me what's going on with you? No.  Cos nothing is going on with me.  Something is.  You're drinking, shoplifting.  I already told you, we didn't steal anything.  And it wasn't me anyway.  You want to tell me why Barry thinks you're the bad influence here?   Cos he's an asshole.    Stop.  This is not a good path you're headed down here.  Look, just tell me what's wrong, OK? I'm actually a good listener.  You want to know what's wrong? My mom got murdered, and you move her into our house and tell me she's your tenant? She is.  She's more.  I can fucking tell.  Astor, you cannot talk to me that way.  Oh.  I thought you said you were this great listener.  I don't want to talk about this any more.  Then we'll just sit here till you do.    You ready to go home?   Not really.  You know I ran away once, too.  I ditched out on my own wedding.  I didn't run away.  Who did that to you? The bruises on your stomach.  You don't know what you're talking about.  Actually I really do.  I think we have a problem.  Yeah, I'm in a battle of wills with my drunk, shoplifting teenage stepdaughter, and she's going to win.  Olivia has bruises all over her stomach and back.  Someone's been hurting her.  She told you? No, I saw.  Wait, you knew about this?   Don't be mad.    I'm not mad.  I'm just I'm I don't know what I am.  I'll be with Olivia.  Promise you won't say anything? I don't want him to hurt her more.  Who? Barry.  Who do you think? He is an asshole.  Does her mom know? He only hits her in places that don't show.  He gets all crazy over nothing.  He doesn't like her hair, she's two minutes late.  I thought she'd be safe here, but then there's Lumen, and Barry showed up, and we just ran.    Why didn't you tell me?   Cos I didn't think you'd care.  Of course I care.  Even when we all lived here, you were so busy out doing stuff all the time.  Olivia's my friend.  My only friend since Mom died.  I wanted to help her, and I didn't know what to do.  You did know what to do.  You came home.  I'm gonna take care of this.  OK? Everything OK with Astor? Nothing turning 20 won't fix.  What'd LaGuerta say? She's not gonna reopen the case.  She thinks that you have some kind of vendetta against her.    That's fucking ridiculous.    Give her a day to cool off.  We'll try again tomorrow.  You're not gonna reopen the case? Are you serious? Come right in, Detective.  There are at least five dead girls in barrels.  And now there's DNA evidence saying that some of the people that are responsible are still out there.  And you think that's about me trying to get back at you? Did you even read the file?   There's fucking proof.    Just watch your tone.  You know you throwing me under the bus for the Fuentes brothers, using your husband as a chess piece, putting Quinn on bogus vacation days so that I don't have a fucking partner? If that's all just some game to you, I'll try to understand it.  But those girls are dead.  Don't you want to make sure that that doesn't happen again? I mean, what the fuck are we doing here? Enough!   OK.    OK what? I'm reopening the case.  But you need to hear me, because you have no idea what you're talking about.  I made the Fuentes situation go away.  I was trying to help Batista.  As far as Quinn goes, he wasn't on vacation.  I suspended him.  To protect your brother.  Protect him from what? You're so interested in the truth, ask Quinn.    Hey.    Can I talk to you? In private? Look, if this is about this morning Last month, when you told me that you were taking some vacation days, were you actually on suspension?   Why? Who told you that?   Were you?   Did LaGuerta say something?   She told me I should talk to you.  Did it have something to do with my brother? Yeah.  But it was nothing.  Then why did you lie? I was investigating Rita's murder, trying to help.  I had a lead on Kyle Butler.  I figured if we could find the person who knew Trinity, then maybe we could track down the creep who killed your sister in law.  LaGuerta told me to back off, leave it to the FBI.  When I didn't, she suspended me.  What was the lead? Doesn't matter.  It didn't pan out.  LaGuerta told me that she was protecting Dexter from you.  Why would she say that? You remember those composite sketches of Kyle Butler? I got this crazy idea that maybe it was your brother.  Nothing came of it, so I dropped it.  I'm an idiot, OK? Yeah, you are.  Deb, I Shit.  What's this? Where's Olivia? I just wanted to speak to you first, parent to parent.  Ah.  You talked to Astor? Yeah, I did.  Honestly, I'm not sure what I should do.  I feel for you, man.  It's tough looking after somebody else's kids.  Sometimes you just gotta show 'em who's boss.  Is that what you do with Olivia, show her who's boss? What's that supposed to mean? I know about Olivia's bruises, how they're strategically placed so they won't show.  I don't know what you're talking about.  No? Let me show you? That's your solar plexus.  Right now, your diaphragm is partially paralysed, which is why you're having trouble catching your breath.  What are you, man, some kind of psycho? Not today.  Just a concerned parent.  That's your liver.  The nice thing about the liver is, if you hit it just right, you get the vagus nerve, which tentacles out to the rest of your body.  Your brain short circuits, your body shuts down, and you feel, what's the word, terror? Which is what Olivia felt every time you hit her there just so the bruises wouldn't show.  I want you to listen to me carefully.  Listen to me carefully, because this is what you're gonna do.  You're gonna call Olivia's mother.  You're gonna tell her you're sick of her fat ass, you can't stand to look at it any more.  And you're gonna make her believe it, because if you don't, she may take you back one day and let you near her kid or mine.  And I can't let that happen.  You're not even gonna swing by to pick up your stuff.  You're just gonna leave.  Tomorrow when I drop Olivia off, you will be gone.  If you ever come back, believe me, I won't go so easy next time.  By the way, that's your kidney.    I can't believe it.    I don't want to hear it, OK? \"This isn't your business, Dexter.  Don't get involved, Dexter.  \"You put too much at risk, Dexter. \" That's not what I was gonna say.  I'm proud of you.  You are? You protected Astor, put yourself out there for another person.  I had no idea you had that in you.  I underestimated you.  Assumed you were a monster when you were capable of so much more.  If only I'd seen that, maybe I wouldn't have led you down this path.    Deb?   Hi, honey.  Get the fuck out of my apartment.  I brought you a present.  Don't you want to see what it is? Your boy Dexter Morgan and his lady friend on his boat at 3:00am in the morning, and they are not fucking.    What's in the bags?   Something heavy.  I'm thinking narcotics, maybe a body.    Are you crazy?   Yeah, but that's beside the point.  Point is that when they came back, those bags were gone.  So whatever they're hiding, it's something big.  This was a bad idea.  Here.  Consider this your severance package.  We're done.  Really? What? You think you can just pay me off like I'm the corner whore? I'm just saying, it's time to stop.  And I'm sayin' bullshit.  If this thing is as big as I think it is, LaGuerta and all them other douchebags in Homicide are gonna be kissing my ass.  Back off, Liddy.  I mean it.  I told you, don't fuck with me.  You know, I just think I may call up that sister.  Give her a ring, see if she wants to get together, have a drink, maybe talk about the brother.  What do you say? Stay the fuck away from me! And stay the fuck away from Deb! So you really did change your mind.  I read the report.  Thank you.  Does this mean Stop sleeping on the couch.  We still got a long way to go between the couch and the bedroom, Maria.  So, what, now you're not even talking to me? Deb, look, I had an idiot theory and I dropped it.  Yeah, because LaGuerta suspended you.  No, because I was wrong.  Look, what I said yesterday is true.  I love you, and I'm not taking it back.  You don't even know what that means.  It means I'd never do anything to hurt you.  Ever.  I trusted you.  And while you were fucking me, you were spreading shit about my brother behind my back.  You think that's not hurting me? Fuck you.    You want us to come inside with you?   No, I'll be OK.  I could barely understand my mom on the phone with all the crying, but she actually said Barry did her a favour leaving.  He definitely did me a favour.  He told her she has a fat ass.  He is not coming back.  Thank you.  Call you later.  Are you gonna tell Grandma and Grandpa? About you getting drunk in Miami and shoplifting? Nah, that's up to you.  We all have our secrets, right? Thanks.  But if it ever happens again It won't.    And if Barry ever shows up   I'll tell you, I promise.    I'm proud of you.    You are? Yeah.  You put yourself out there for another person.  I want you to know something.  If Lumen's your girlfriend, I want you to tell me.  OK.    But she's not.    She's not just your tenant, though.  She's a friend who's been through some really  really bad stuff.  I'm helping her deal with it.  Does it make you feel better?   What do you mean?   About Mom.  Being there for Lumen, does it make you feel better about what happened to Mom? I love you.  You know that? You should come in, say hi to Cody.  It'll blow your cover, about Miami.  Mama.  This is Mama? Mama.  OK, bud.  Jordan Chase told me to figure out what I want most.  The answer is simple   to be a good dad.  But now that Astor's safe, what I want most is Jordan on my table.  I need to get an ID on that blood.    Hey.    Hey.    How was Orlando?   Uh, it was pleasantly uneventful.  Astor's back with her grandparents,   Cody grew about a foot.    Oh.  Glad to hear it.  Your blood results are in, by the way.  So, did you get back an ID on your homicide victim? No.    Then what's that?   She's not a victim.  She's alive, boozing it up in Coral Gables.  Two DUls in three years.  I guess I messed up.  If she's not a victim, then who is she? No worries.  When you mess up, it makes me feel better about me.    Dexter?   No, it's Jordan Chase.  But I'm looking for Dexter.  Is he there? He He's not available right now.  Can I leave a message? Uh huh.  Tell him I'm just checking in, and I'd like him to schedule another appointment as soon as possible.  OK.  I will.  Bye.  Hang on a second.  Tell Dexter one more thing.    OK.    Tell him time is of the essence.  Tick tick tick.  That's the sound of his life running out.  Could you be sure to tell him that? Take care, Lumen.      Previous EpisodeNext Episode"

Your blood results are in.    Emily Birch.  She's not a victim.  She's alive.  Boozing it up in Coral Gables.  The Barrel Girls case, there are partial sequences from multiple people.    Cole and Boyd did this together?   With maybe three or four others.  As far as Quinn goes, he wasn't on vacation.  I suspended him.  To protect your brother.  I trusted you.  And while you were fucking me, you were spreading shit about my brother behind my back.  Fuck you.  Cole as a teenager.  Your boy Dexter Morgan and his girlfriend on his boat at 3:00am.    What's in the bags?   Something heavy.  I'm thinking narcotics.  Maybe a body.  It's time to stop.  Stay the fuck away from Deb! Dexter? No, it's Jordan Chase.  Can I leave a message? Tick tick tick.  That's the sound of his life running out.  Take care, Lumen.  They say that history repeats itself, but I will never put my family in danger again.  Now that Jordan Chase knows Lumen and I are onto him, I need to plan for the worst.  Yeah, I think that's the last of it.  I put the grandparents' address in the navigational system.  And I have the print out you gave me.  And Harrison is going to have such a good time with his big sister and big brother in Orlando.  I'm getting Harrison out of Miami and Lumen out of that house.  Dexter.  I haven't been apart from him since Rita died.  Nothing is going to happen to Harrison.  Love you.  Call me as soon as you get there.    Bye bye.    Bye, Dexter.  Lumen.  Come on.  We'll be safe here.  Jordan doesn't know about this place.  He thinks we're at the house.  What the fuck are you up to now? We can't wait any more.  We need to take out Jordan.  That might be difficult.  He's surrounded at all times by four bodyguards, except when he's on stage in front of 200 people.    I think we should start with the others.    We don't even know who they are.  No.  But she can help us.  Is that her? The one whose blood Jordan wears around his neck? Yeah.  Emily Birch.  She looks like me and the girls in the barrels.  But older.  She's the same age as Jordan, and Cole and Boyd.  I think she was the first victim.  How is she still alive? I don't know.  I hope she can tell us.    We're gonna talk to her today?   I'll come back at lunchtime.  We'll go then.  Stay inside.  Don't open the door.    I won't.    To anyone.  OK, by now you're all aware that new evidence has been found in the Barrel Girls case, which this department is again pursuing as a top priority.  Our initial conclusion that Boyd Fowler was solely responsible for these crimes was wrong.  It now appears that he had help.  And the day began with such promise.  Vince, can you take us through the DNA? New evidence \"has been found\"? Like, maybe the evidence discovered itself.  I'm just glad to be back.  It beats the fucking file room.  DNA reports from the Coroner's Office point to multiple perps.    Do we have any names?   No.  What we have are partial sequences from very seriously degraded DNA.  But the evidence confirms what we knew about Boyd Fowler.  And it also points with a high probability to Cole Harmon, Jordan Chase's head of security.  As you know, Cole Harmon was our original suspect in the case.  Until I pointed them toward Boyd Fowler.  He is now our main target again.  A target you'll never hit.  He's already buried at sea.    Morgan.    Yeah.  Debra.  Take Quinn and bring in Cole Harmon.  Start at his office.  In the meantime, I'm getting search warrants for his house.    You should have them within the hour.    Fuck yeah.  That's it.  Hey, congrats.  Looks like your filing days are over.  Yeah, at least until LaGuerta's mood changes.  Angel.  So, you got Morgan back.  Yeah.  Thanks for that.    It's what you wanted.    She earned it.    So   I'll keep you posted on the case.    May I help you?   Miami Metro Homicide.  We're looking for Cole Harmon.  Mr Harmon hasn't worked here in more than two weeks.  What? You should probably talk to Mr Chase.  Are you fucking kidding me? Your head of security disappears and you don't think it's worth reporting? It seemed like an internal matter.  Cole Harmon is wanted for the rape and murder of at least five women.  Hold on a second.  Detective Batista told me and Mr Harmon that you'd made a mistake, that some animal pickup officer was your sole suspect.  He's not any more.    And I was supposed to divine that?   Do you know where he is or not? Detective Morgan, I don't know where this aggression is coming from or why it's directed at me, but a word of caution.  Aggression can be a powerful motivator, but it can also cloud your percep Save your bullshit for your seminars and answer my question.  I have no idea where Cole is.  He told me he needed some personal time.  Your head of security says he needs some time off and you just say OK? I have been nothing but cooperative with your department.  But that was predicated on a certain amount of discretion on your part, and respect.  Now you barge into my place of business, hurling insinuations.  No one is insinuating anything.  Look, if you hear from Cole, give us a call, OK? From now on, any contact between us will be through my attorney.  He'll be hearing from us.  Is there some reason you needed to antagonise him like that? Yes.  Girls are being raped, tortured and stuffed into barrels.  Two rapist killers are directly connected to him.  What are the odds he knows absolutely nothing about it?   Small.    Yes.  Small, Quinn.  That was my point.  I understand that.  I'm on your side, OK? The search warrants have probably come through.  Let's go fuck up Cole Harmon's living room.    Emily Birch?   Yes.  Who are you? We're trying to track down some information on Jordan Chase.  The Jordan Chase? We understand that you know him.  Do I look like the kind of person that knows Jordan Chase? Well, he knows who you are.  How? Do you mind if I show you a photo?   I think you need to go.    Maybe you know some of these people.    No.    Could you at least just look at it? I told you.  I don't know who any of those people are and I want you to go.  Emily That went well.  Did you see how she reacted to that photo? She definitely knows who they are.  You'd think she'd want to talk to us.  I don't know.  Security bars, DUIs.  She's got a lot of defences in place.  There's got to be a way to get her to give us those names.  Deb needs me on a search warrant at Cole Harmon's house.  I'll drop you back at the apartment first.    I don't see any blood.    You think we'd call you here for nothing? Kid gloves, OK? That's gonna tell us which scumbag friends he's been talking to.  Unless there's such a thing as red mould, this sure as shit looks like blood.  Cole Harmon's blood.  Left there when Lumen hit him to save me.    It's definitely blood.    Blood that's been cleaned up.  You don't miss a thing.  Unfortunately.  There's something fucked up about this whole situation.  Cole's car is still in the driveway.  It's not like he got up and ran.  It's like he disappeared, or he got disappeared.  Rush that blood work.  I want to know if it's Cole's and if someone did a number on him.  Deb.  Deb, you got to take a look at this.  Please.  Come on! DVDs.  They were in that lockbox.  No! No! They videotaped themselves torturing these women.  Lumen was the last victim.  That would make her number 13.  Turn it off.  Despite having considered myself a monster for as long as I can remember, it still comes as a shock when I'm confronted with the depth of evil that exists in this world.  Did the blood work go out?   An hour ago.    And? Deb, the results won't come back for at least a day.  Oh, fuck.  But you'll let me know? Right.  I need to take a breath, you know? Whew.  It's hard.  There is some seriously fucked up shit in there.  And if Debra gets eyes on Lumen's DVD, she'll know everything.  It will all unravel.  Deb, Cole Harmon's emails and phone records are up.    You want to go through them?   Fuck yes.  Let's see who he's been talking to.  No, no, no, no.  Chain of custody, chain of custody.  Your sister's new mantra.  Last time someone came in here, she nearly killed me, which, frankly, would be better than going through another one of these DVDs.  Each one, same creepy place, same creepy shit.  Notice anything about them? They all look like Lumen.  No, not really.  Well, they could be sisters.  All 13 of them.    Which is weird.  I mean, 13.    Why? You were at Boyd Fowler's house when we went through it, right? Yep.  Remember those locks of hair? There were 12.  So, there should be 12 victims.    But there are 13 discs.    Huh.  He's nearly there.  Yeah, that is weird.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, Dex! Whoa! Back, back, back!   Dude!   Sorry.  You've got to be more careful, man! This is all we got to nail these fucking assholes.  I know.  I'm sorry.  I'll just I'll leave.  I've been trying to get a handle on this Emily Birch and there's nothing.  She graduates high school in 1992 and then it's just a big blank.  Except for those DUIs that you found.  What? They found this in the search at Cole's.  The men who hurt you, they made DVDs of everything they did.    Did everyone watch it?   No.  I managed to get it out of evidence in time.  Did you Did you watch it? Only enough to make sure I had the right one.  Are you sure you want to keep it? Number 13.  That's what I was to them.  It must've been hard for you to get that.  I know that you risk your life every day that you're with me.  You've been my only way through this.  Well, I guess we both met each other at the right time.  No! No! No! No! No! Let me out of here! No! No! No! No! No! Let me go! Yeah!   No!   Yes! Get me out of here! No! No! No! The DVDs.  Lumen watching at home.  Deb watching here.  Both wanting some sort of resolution.  But I can only help one.  Watching these DVDs, watching it actually happen, is worse than any fucking crime scene.  What these women went through, I don't know, maybe it's a fucking blessing that they're dead.  No one could go through something like this and have a life again.  People may be stronger than you think.  Believe me, on this one, you're wrong.  There's no coming back from something like this.    Where's 13?   Disc 13, it was damaged.  I was actually grateful I didn't have to watch another one of these.  Have you been here all night? Yeah.  And I think it was worth it cos I think I'm starting to figure it out.  I went through Cole Harmon's contacts.  And do you remember that weird plastic wrap murder a few weeks back? Those two guys at the warehouse.  Yeah, one of them was a dentist.  A kids' dentist.  Dan Mendell.  Well, it turns out he and Cole are buddies.  They fucking poke each other on Facebook.  And you see that ring on the DVD? It matches photos taken at the warehouse crime scene.  So, I think he's one of these guys.  So, Dan the dentist is dead.  He was shot to death.  Looks like somebody attacked Cole Harmon in his house.  And Boyd Fowler's disappeared.  This is a group of guys that like to get together and they like to do this for fun.  So, what else do they have in common? They're all missing.  But they're not on the run, I can tell you that.  Not one of them bought a plane ticket, or emptied their bank account or used a fucking credit card.    Someone is taking these guys out.    Who? Well, at first I thought they were turning on each other.  Then I thought, \"That doesn't make sense.  Why would they do that after all this time?\" So, I started asking myself, \"Who would want to take these guys out?\" And you know the first person that came to mind? Me.  You? Someone who knows what these cocksuckers have been up to and wants to give them what they deserve.  So, what are you saying? There's a vigilante out there? Yeah, I think that's what I'm saying.  Yes.  This is what happened to me.  No! No! Let me out of here! No! Is it also what happened to you? No! Let me go! There were 13 of us after you.  I didn't know.  I didn't know there was anybody else until you knocked on my door.  I'm the only one who survived.  Oh, my God.  Emily, I need you to tell me what happened to you.  Can you do that? It was almost 20 years ago during the summer at camp.  I was a CIT, counsellor in training, a year older than them.  They were just like everybody else.  Except Jordan.  Only, he wasn't called Jordan then.  He was Eugene Greer.  That's Jordan Chase? When he was Eugene Greer.  I felt sorry for him.  Became his friend, you know? We would take these walks, and one day we were walking and I blacked out.  He must have drugged me or something.  They drugged me too.  I woke up in a cabin.  My clothes were off.  And I was tied to a bunk.  Eugene started in So, he attacked you.  No.  Eugene never touched me.  But he got those guys going.  He talked them into it.  Told them to seize their desires.  And And they did.  And I was watching Gene's face.  The look that came over his face, it was just a flash.  But it's the same look he has all the time now.  And I got dressed.  And they made me take their picture.  This photo.  So, this is Cole.  And that's Dan.  And that's Boyd.  And Jordan.  Who is this one? Alex.  Alex Tilden.  He's the fifth.  Can I help you? Yeah.  You got a pen? Sure.  Just, uh, leaving a note for Joey.  I'm an old friend.  Thank you.  You're You're Harry's kid, right?   Blood guy.    That's right.  And your sister, Detective Morgan Usually it's the boy child ends up doing the police work, not the girl.  But here you are in the geek squad.  Yeah.  Blood spatter suited me more.    You like the blood, huh?   I like catching bad guys.  That's cute.  Dexter.  Yeah, I'll be right down.    Got to go.    So long Dexter.  Hey, beautiful, I got to pick up a few things for a stake out.  It's for Detective Quinn.  You see his name there.  Let's see.  Surveillance cameras, wireless mics, and a portable wireless recorder monitor.    Yep.    Be right back.    Thank you.    Mm hm.  So, Emily never told anyone.  She said she was afraid of her father.  He hated her friends.  He hated the way she dressed.  She was afraid he would blame her.  That's probably the reason Jordan let her live.  Listening to her talk, I could just see it.  Jordan's whole philosophy, transforming your life, blah blah blah.  It all came from destroying hers.  That moment turned Jordan into a monster.  My guess, he already was a monster.  You weren't supposed to see her alone.  You were supposed to stay in the apartment.    I tried.  I couldn't.    It's not safe.  You understand that, right? Did Emily name the other one in the photo? Yes.  What? I want to be the one to do this.  It's one thing to watch it.  It's another thing to actually do it.    I know.    It will change you.  I'm already changed.  What's the last guy's name? I'm Alex Tilden.  How can I help you? Detective Quinn.  Morgan.  Metro Homicide.  Homicide? OK.  What's going on? Well, we're investigating a recent series of murders.  You may have read about it.  A number of girls were killed and stored in barrels.  Yeah.  Yeah, I saw it on the news.  It's pretty shocking.  What does it have to do with me? Cole Harmon is a suspect in our case.  Your name turned up on a list of acquaintances.  We're talking to everyone on the list.  Ye Uh, yeah.  Well, sure.  Yeah, I know Cole.  You two talk on the phone a lot? We're in a fantasy football league together.  I was trying to get him to give up a player all season.  Have you heard from him lately? No.  No.    What's going on here?   Do you know any of Cole's friends?   Dan Mendell? He's a kids' dentist.    I don't have kids.    Do you know him?   No.  Boyd Fowler.  That name ring a bell? No.  I don't know either of those men.  You want to tell me what this is all about? Then, unless I'm in some sort of trouble, I need to get back to work.  I have a closing in 15 minutes I should prepare for.  One more name.  Jordan Chase.  Jordan Chase Jordan Chase? He's messed up in this?   Do you know him?   I never met him.  You know, I've always wanted to.  Well, if you, uh, do hear from Cole, give us a call, OK? I'll do that.  Thank you.  \"If you do hear from Cole, give us a call\"? Might be hard for him to get cell reception from six feet underground.  You really think a vigilante's killing off these people one by one? Anyone who knows what these guys were up to would do something pretty extreme.  Watch the tapes again.  You'll get it.    I'm not dressed right.    No, you're fine.  But I did get you something.  Oh.  They're just like yours.  Try them on.  From now on, we have to be especially careful not to leave anything behind.  No fingerprints, no evidence.  Nothing that points back to us.  You sure we have enough time to get it all done? Yes, if we move now.  His bank closes at 7:00.  We have to be in and out of his house before he gets back.  I'm used to hunting on my own, and here we are, hunting as a pair.  Looks like Alex believes in karma.  And it's all become so natural.    Should we take it?   No.  He'll know someone was here.  This is just a fact finding mission.  I think we know what the facts are.  There's a way to do this.  It protects you.  It protects both of us.  One of these days, you've got to teach me how to do that.  My grandparents gave me this when I graduated from high school.  I was wearing it the night they took me.  This is mine.  Let me.  How do you choose the what do you call it, the place? The kill room.  We need someplace inconspicuous and secure.  Like this? Maybe it's true that pairs survive better in the wild.  It's not easy talking to a stranger.  But I did it anyway.  For you.  You told her everything, about what happened at the camp? It was hard, but yeah.  You told her about Alex? I told her the truth, like you said.  Even though I didn't want to.  Are you in trouble, Jordan? The girl you talked to was making waves.  But everything's fine now, thanks to you.  She was pretty, the girl.  Emily.  No one could ever take your place.  You know that, right? We have a bond that no one can ever break.  You made me what I am today.  Do you know how special you are to me? Eugene Greer has arrived.  Oh.  The parade's here.  Four bodyguards? That's it? Detectives, I'd like you to meet my friend and attorney, Stuart Frank.  How do you do? You've requested a DNA sample from my client.  I'd like to know why.  There was unidentified male DNA found on the Barrel Girl victims.  We want to clear Mr Chase as a suspect.  Why on earth is he even considered a suspect? Because the DNA we have identified belongs to men directly connected to your client.  Cole Harmon is your head of security.  Boyd Fowler is a devoted fan.  We found your books and tapes in his home.  That proves exactly nothing.  A million people have connections with my client.  I assume the two men you're talking about drive cars.  Are you going to start interrogating automobile CEOs? Detective Morgan, I've helped a lot of people over the years.  Many of them were broken individuals going through very difficult periods in their lives.  Is that what you call this? Someone who's going through \"a very difficult period\" in their life? If Mr Chase knew anything about this, he would have informed the police.  Now, unless you're working your way toward some more reasonable line of inquiry, we're done here.  No, we're not.  I want to do anything I can to help you find the people who did that.  If you want my DNA, you're welcome to it.    Jordan.    It's OK, Stu.  I know it's your duty to be suspicious.  But I swear, no one is more disturbed than I am that people I've helped could be responsible for something like this.  So, how does this work? It's just a cheek swab.  It won't take but a second.    You don't have to do this.    Dexter will help you.  Have a seat.  I was hoping we'd have a chance to speak again.    We don't have anything to talk about.    Oh, I beg to differ.  I think we have a lot to discuss.  After all, you are a client.  Former.  Your programme didn't work for me.  Regardless, when I see someone on a self destructive path, I can't just stay silent.  Often, people get involved with someone who is toxic to them, unstable and dangerous.  Bad things happen.  Open.  You're just now putting your life back together after a terrible tragedy.  I implore you, don't invite another one.  For yourself or for what's left of your family.  You know, I'm glad you didn't touch any of them.  Really? Why is that? Because this DNA test will clear you and leave you all to me.  And to her.  Your time is up.  There you go.  You're done.  Thank you, Dexter.  I'm here for you.  Don't forget that.  And soon, I'll be there for you.  I appreciate it.  What else did Jordan say? That you were toxic and dangerous, and that I was on a self destructive path.  That sounds like a threat.  He was trying to make me doubt you.  What do you think? Uh You look   I look stupid, don't I?   No, no, no.  You can tell me the truth.  You look perfect.    Really? Look at those.  These are beautiful.    May I?   Sure.  The other way.  Oh.  Just be careful.  Oh, my goodness.  I'm thinking maybe I should leave town for a while, take some sick days, get the hell out of here.  No.  The police could come back with more questions about Cole.  If you're suddenly gone, it might look suspicious.  Well, at least I'll fucking be alive! Alex, you need to calm down.  I've taken steps to resolve the situation.  What steps? What are you talking about?   I'm on top of it.    No, not so far, you're not.  I am.  And I need you to trust me.  I do trust you.  You know that.  Good.  Now, listen to me.  It's very important that you keep acting like everything's normal.  You're not gonna leave town.  You're gonna maintain your regular routine, to the letter.  Do you understand? Alex? Tell me you understand what I've said.    I understand.    Now go home like you always do.  Have a vodka tonic.  Watch TV.  I'll call you as soon as I know more.  Everything's gonna be fine.  I promise.  OK.  Right on schedule.  Detective Morgan, please?   Morgan.    Detective, it's Jordan Chase.  How can I help you? My lawyer doesn't know I'm making this call.    OK.    But those images you showed me, I haven't been able to get them out of my head.  They're very disturbing.  They are.  I just want you to know, I've always considered myself a friend of the police.  Well, uh, thank you, friend.  What What is this about? A strange call came into my office from an Alex Tilden.  Alex Tilden called you? What did he want? I didn't speak to him myself, but my secretary said that he was looking for Cole Harmon.  She said he sounded panicked, that he wanted to speak to Cole about a flight he needed to arrange.  A flight to where? That's all I know.  It's not much, I realise, but I hope it can be useful.  Thank you, Mr Chase.  Saddle up.  It looks like our fantasy footballer's leaving town.  No! No! Let me out of here! No! No! No! No! Stop! No! Let me go! Oh, my God.  Help! Who are you? What's that? What Aagh! It's for her.    Who?   I think you know.  I mean, what's her name? Now you want to know her name? Look, you really have this all wrong.  Save it for her.    What's the address?   Alex Tilden, 3040.  That's 3048.  Here it is.  And he's home.  I look different, don't I? Without my hands tied behind my back.  But you recognise me.  I can tell.    I ne I never wanted to do any of it.    Really? It wasn't It wasn't me.  It was Jordan.  It's all Jordan.  You know He has this way.  Of getting inside your head, getting you in touch with your primal nature? He made me do things I never would have done.  No, you made me do things I never would have done.  Ever.  Ever! What do you people want? I can give you Jordan Chase.    We've got Jordan Chase.    Well, what do you want? Everybody wants something.  I mean, that's what brought us to this fucking unfortunate situation.  Am I right? I'm a banker.  I can get money, lots of it.  We can work this out.  So, tell me, what's this gonna cost? Just give me a number.  No.  I There's a first time for everything.  A first step.  A first word.  A first kiss.  A first kill.  Somehow you know when the time is right.  Aim for the heart.  Are you OK? Yes.  We should lock down the airports in case he tries to flee.  He's not going anywhere.  Look at this.  Looks like a partial footprint.  It looks small.  Maybe a woman's.  And she was just here.  Remember at Boyd's house, that fucking hair book, it had 12 pieces in it? But there are 13 DVDs.  One of them didn't get their hair taken.  So, what are you saying exactly? Well, what if one of them escaped somehow and after everything they'd done, they've come back to get even? What if the vigilante is one of their victims? Harry tried to mould me into the image of the monster he thought I was.  He told me to flee human connection, so that became a way of life for me.  But with Lumen I'm someone different.  In her eyes I'm not a monster at all.      Previous EpisodeNext Episode"

No one could ever take your place.  You know that.  You know, I'm glad you didn't touch any of them.  Really? Why is that? Because this DNA test will clear you and leave you all to me and to her.  The men who hurt you, they made DVDs of everything they did.  Did everyone watch it? I managed to get it out of evidence in time.  You think you can just pay me off like I'm the corner whore? Stay the fuck away from Deb! I trusted you.  And while you were fucking me you were spreading shit about my brother behind my back.  Fuck you.    Who'd you say you were?   A friend of Joey.  I got to pick up a few things for a stake out.  It's for Detective Quinn.  You see his name there.  A strange call came into my office from an Alex Tilden.  Alex Tilden, 3040.  Here it is.  Look at this.  Looks like a partial footprint.  What if the vigilante is one of their victims? It's all become so natural.    You OK?   Yes.  But with Lumen, I'm someone different.  In her eyes, I'm not a monster at all.    Detectives.    We appreciate you fitting us in.  We wanted to thank you for your phone call regarding Alex Tilden.    It was really helpful.    That's good to hear.  We followed up immediately.  We went to his house, but   it looked like we'd just missed him.    That's unfortunate.  Yeah, it is, because he seems to have disappeared off the face of the earth.    I see.    Yeah, like Cole Harmon.    And Boyd Fowler.    Yeah, him too.  Now, I keep asking myself, what's the connection? What do these three people have in common? You.  You're what they have in common.  You.  Oh, here it comes.  Why don't you just save us a lot of time and tell us what that connection is? It's ridiculous that you think I have anything to do with this.  I gave you my DNA! What were the results? Go on, remind me.  Your DNA wasn't found on any of the barrel girls.  That's correct, so all this right here is a colossal waste of my time and yours.  Well, I've got nothing but time.  So you can keep fooling everybody in your little seminars, but I'm onto you.  You're obsessed with me.  That's what this is about.  It happens.  You achieve a bit of fame and people latch on to you in various twisted ways.  I'd be careful, if I were you.  It's typically seen in someone who's trying to avoid facing the dismal nature of her own small life.    I think you slipped up.    It's not at all healthy.    And I think a barrel girl got away.    It's something I can help you with.  And now she's hunting down the people that took her.  And people all around you are dropping like flies.  You could be next.  Seriously, I'll be fine.  It's you I'm concerned about.  Don't say I didn't warn you.  Jordan Chase.  We know exactly where he is.  Yeah, but there's no way to get to him.  The entire top floor is guarded.  Elevators? Monitored.  Stairs?   Locked from the inside.    Yeah.  But you know how to pick locks.  Not without setting off the fire alarm.  OK.  So we have to figure out a way to get him to come out.  How? He has everything he needs up there.  Not everything.  Me.  He wants me.  No.  There's got to be a way to use me as bait.    It worked with Cole.    I'm not gonna use you as bait.    It's too dangerous.    You know I can do this.  Yeah, I do.  I saw you kill Alex Tilden.  But we have to be extra careful.  Jordan has more than just our eyes on him.    The police.    My sister.  I'm so sorry that I put you in this position, having to lie to her like that.  I don't like it, but it's not the first time.  She's never suspected anything? I don't know.  Maybe Deb has a blind spot when it comes to me.  Sometimes I feel like I'm taking advantage of her, but it's for the best.  She's not like us.  \"Us. \" Oh.  There's a camera in the room.  The baby monitor is picking up the signal.  Somebody's watching us.  Jordan has to be behind this and close by.  Wireless cameras have a limited range, their signal routed to a recording unit in a vacant apartment, a motor home a van.  It could be anywhere.  Jordan Chase is up to his ball sack in this.  I fuckin' know it.  Just means we keep digging.  You coming in? I got to grab something from my car.  I'll be right up.    Hey.    Hey.    What are you doing here?   My union appeal's been denied.  I am now officially terminated.  So how's your day?   I'm sorry to hear that.    I don't want your pity.  Good.  Then Thirty years of putting bad guys away, this is what them cocksuckers upstairs do to me.  Take my pension, wipe their ass with it and just flush it right on down the shitter.  Look, I got to get inside.    I need your help on a bust.    Bust? What are you talking about? Something big.  Something big enough to make them stand up and take notice.  Something big enough to make them give me my job back on the police force.    Your boy Dexter   What the fuck? What are you doing? Didn't you hear me, Quinn? I'm not a cop any more.  Now, I need a cop to make this bust.  No.  Forget it.  You little fucking wimp.  You're up to your ass in alligators with this thing, whether you like it or not.  So you're gonna make this bust and I'm gonna call you, you'd best come running.  What are you in the mood for? I'm thinking seafood.  It's a perfect night to grill.  I'll go check what's in the fridge.  Harrison's baby monitor made it easy to pinpoint where this was hidden, but the bigger problem remains.  What exactly has Jordan heard and where are those recordings? On second thought, let's go out to eat.  It's not Jordan.  It's worse.  It's someone from my own station.  What? Why would somebody from the police department bug your apartment? I don't know.  There's a serial number on the camera.  I'll go in tomorrow and find out who checked it out.  I don't understand.  This could have something to do with my sister's theory.  What are you talking about? She has this theory about vigilantes hunting down the rapists.  So you think she planted cameras? No, it's not her.  I'd know.  It could be anyone.  But how could they be onto us?   We've been so careful.    I don't know yet.  The one good thing is that no one has seen those recordings yet.  How do you know? Because we haven't been arrested.  Jordan is gonna get away with everything and we're gonna be arrested? We don't know that.  Look, for now we just pretend like everything's OK.  If we have something to talk about, we talk about it out here where it's safe.  But we were so close.    It can't end this way.    It's not going to.  I checked with the apartment manager, then the neighbours.  That motor home is gone.  It's got to be one of these vans.  You said there were four vans last night.  It's down to three now.  I'll keep checking back.    Sonya, everything all right?   Everything is great.  Astor and Cody are spoiling Harrison silly.  Good.  He's taking a little nap now, so I was just making a list for Sunday, and I wondered, do you have any special requests?   Sunday?   Harrison's birthday party.  Of course! Right.  Harrison's birthday.  Astor and Cody can't wait to see you.  I'm looking forward to seeing them too.  But hold on a second.  It's not safe to bring everyone here.    We can go to them.    You're coming? I just invited myself.  Sonya, we're gonna have the party in Orlando.  Oh.  OK.  It's just easier than making everyone drive down here.  Perfect.  Come on, I got to get to work.  Keep an eye on these vans and call me if you see anything.  No torches, no pitchforks, no one looking at me any differently.  Dex, I need you.  In a minute.  I have something I need to do.  Find out who planted those cameras.  We're all waiting on you.  That doesn't sound good.  So, as I was saying, everything keeps leading back to Jordan Chase.  Why would he be running a rape club with these putos? I don't know.  But I'm pretty fuckin' sure he is.  Where are we on the banker, Alex Tilden?   He's gone.  He disappeared.    We got his DNA from a toothbrush.  Ties him to the barrel girls, like the others, but no connection to Jordan that we can find.    Then I suggest you find that connection.    I'm on it.    And the dentist, Mendell?   He's the odd man out.  He doesn't seem to have any connection to any of the other guys.  Again, let's find that connection.    Morgan, Quinn.    We got it.  Phone the neighbours.  Wake the kids.  Kick the dog.  Remember that muddy female boot print outside Tilden's house? Yeah, we found it.  Well, my brothers in blue, it has a twin.  Found it outside the vacant house next door.  Let me see that.  Naturally, I went inside.  The dining room was spotless, and I mean recently cleaned kind of spotless, unlike the rest of the house.  My schnoz also detected the smell of bleach.  One more day, and the smell would have dissipated.  My guess, the vigilante brought your missing banker over and offed him right there in the dining room.  Excuse me, did I hear the word \"vigilante\"? It was a theory I was keeping to myself, but It's out there, but we may have a vigilante on our hands.  I sent Masuka over to Tilden's to see if he could comb for any evidence that a homicide had taken place.  Keep going.  Please don't.  There are 13 DVDs and only 12 victims.  So I'm thinking that one of the barrel girls escaped and now she's after the men that abducted her.  And she is hunting them and she is killing them.  How is that even possible? The barrel girls are all slight of build.    Alex Tilden was, what, 175 pounds?   Minimum.  Maybe she had help.    Like who?   I don't know.  A A man.  Someone she trusts.  Someone who cares about her.  A father, brother, husband, boyfriend.  So now it's vigilantes in love.  Yeah, like Romeo and Juliet except they didn't kill anyone.  No, more like, uh, Bonnie and Clyde.  Great.  They ended up dead in a bullet riddled car.  We all have our assignments.  Let's go.  Closer to ten minutes.  She likes a cup of coffee with her smoke.  But that's more than enough time to see that Detective Joseph Quinn checked out the cameras.  Three cameras, to be exact, two microphones, a recorder.  Only three days ago.  Maybe no one's seen the footage yet.  Case number It's from 1982, when Quinn was in grade school eating paste.  It's a fake.  No court orders authorised for my address.  This is off the books.  Quinn's doing this on his own.  Lumen.  Plans for lunch? Start with the hard drive.  Yeah, any storage devices, video files, flash drives.  Wow, this thing is ancient.  Who is this guy? Quinn.  My sister's partner.  Oh, wow.  Are they close? They used to be.  You got anything? Not much in the way of video files.  Anything of us? No.  Just a cat that hiccups and farts at the same time.  Cute.  Check the bedroom.  You take the closet.  I'll check the drawers.  Oh, shit.  What is it?   Us.    The marina.  That's the night we dumped Cole.  He's been watching us for weeks.  He knows everything.  Wait.  You're not gonna take them with you? Tip him off that we found them? No, he'll just print more.  We have to find the digital source.  Right.  Find the recording equipment.  We're not open any more.    Mrs Mendell? Laura Mendell?   Yes? I'm Detective Morgan.  This is Detective Quinn.  We'd like to ask you a couple of questions about your husband.  Please, OK? Just no more questions.  We've been through this, OK? I don't know anything.    Of course, I should have.    Why is that? I was very naive, but now it all makes sense.  Those week long fishing trips he used to take.    He'd go without you?   Of course without me.  It was just him and his buddies.  He called it his \"man time\", but of course that has a whole other meaning now.  Did he ever give you names of the men on those trips? No.  I never met any of them.  He kept me completely in the dark about his whole closeted gay life.  I mean, why didn't he just tell me? Actually, Mrs Mendell, we have information which leads us to believe your husband wasn't in fact gay.  The crime scene may have been altered to give that impression.  But he was linked to a series of rapes.  And murders.  My God.  Who is this man I married? I'm sorry to bring you that news.  But do any of these names sound familiar?   Boyd Fowler.  Cole Harmon.    No, I don't know them.  Alex Tilden.  Jordan Chase.    Jordan Chase?   Yes.  Well, that's him, right there.  \"Best two man sailing team, Dan Mendell and Eugene Greer\"? Jordan Chase is Eugene Greer or he used to be.  Dan knew him when they were kids.  It was a really big deal to him.  That's our connection.  Why do you think the wife never had a clue about what was up with her husband? This barrel girl stuff has gone on the entire time they were married.  He was probably a really good liar.  Men sometimes have that ability.  It was his fault, not hers.  How do you want to go at this Eugene Greer thing? Just pull up everything we can.  School records, juvie records.  I fuckin' knew Chase was full of shit.  Who creates a new identity for themselves? A dirt bag who has something to hide.  I've got it.  Jordan Chase lied about knowing Alex Tilden.  In the past ten years, Tilden oversaw six properties purchased by Chase's corporation.  Dan the Dentist also knew him.  And Jordan Chase is an alias.  That whole bullshit persona that he built for himself is a lie.  His real name's Eugene Greer.  Mendell and Chase were friends as kids.  So, wait.  That ties Jordan directly to each of the barrel girls' rapists.  Yeah, but still all circumstantial.  Not enough to bring him in.  Yeah, but it's enough to bring his lying ass in for questioning.  We've got to keep pushing at him, scare him a little bit till he starts making some mistakes.  Deb's closing in on Chase.  Quinn's closing in on me.  Time's running out for both of us.  Hey, any good news? Uh, yeah, we've connected Jordan Chase to all of the rapists, so I'm about to nail this fuck to the wall.  Good.  What? What's up? I'm kind of busy.  Just wondering if you want to go with me to Orlando on Sunday for Harrison's birthday.  Oh.  Wha   I do, but   You have other plans with Quinn? What? No, it It's with work.  It's the case.  Besides, Quinn's the last person that you'd want to have there.    Oh?   Trust me.    So it's over?   Yes.  No.  Fuck, I don't know.  It's complicated.  You don't have to tell me.    He lied to me about something.    Must have been something big.  He lied to me about you.  About me? What do you mean? Quinn had this idiot notion that you were somehow connected to Rita's death.    That's   It's crazy, I know.    Why didn't you tell me?   Because Because you've been through enough.  And I just found out.  When he finally told me I felt so betrayed because as much as I don't want to admit it, I really care about him.  \"Care\", present tense? It's complicated, remember? I thought I knew him, and he kept telling me he loved me.  But what he did I mean, I can't have somebody like that.  You don't lie to somebody that you're close to.  You have their back.  I need someone I can trust 100 per cent.  Like this.    A boot print?   The vigilante.  She has someone in her life, a guy who's helping her, someone that would do anything and everything for her.  How do you know that? Honestly, I don't know, but what they're doing takes devotion.  To kill someone together, that's some pretty serious shit.  Is that what Lumen and I have, serious shit? He's risking his life.  He's putting everything on the line to make what happened to her right.  As crazy as that sounds, what what word would you use to describe that but \"love\"? It's pretty fucked up, isn't it? Yeah, pretty fucked up.  Kind of beautiful too.  Just got this in.  It's handmade.  It's very chic.  Um   It's not quite me.    Perhaps one of the rings.  How about that? It's nice.  Small enough to carry, locking pin, stainless steel blade.    How does it feel?   Good.  We'll take it.    Thank you.    Sure.  It's just an hour or so till Quinn gets off work.  If he decides to check his recording equipment tonight I should be there.  What is Quinn after? What does he want with us? He doesn't want us.  He wants me.  He was coming after me before we even met.  I didn't mean for you to get caught up in this.  You should leave.  You tried that once before, remember? You tried to ship me away.  That was different.  I don't want you to leave for good.  Just till I deal with this.  Deal with it how? I don't know.  Whatever needs to be done.  I appreciate the offer, but I'm not going anywhere.    Lumen, it's getting dangerous.    Getting dangerous? I'm not walking away.  We're a team.  We have serious shit.  What does that mean? It's just something Deb said about us.  You told her about us? No, she was talking about the vigilantes.  She was talking about us without knowing she was talking about us.  Maybe we should both take off.  Get on a cruise ship.  Hop a freighter.  Steal a tugboat.  You said that you didn't want me to leave.  Does that mean that you want me to stay? I do.  We should go.  OK, so Eugene Greer grew up in some redneck town near Tallahassee.  He had a single mom, now dead, no siblings, pretty nondescript childhood.  Moved to Miami when he was 18, dropped about 100 pounds, changed his name to Jordan Chase, pretty much reinvented himself.  Take a look at these before and after photos.  Ooh.  Like a different person.  I think he might have had some plastic surgery along the way.  Look at this.  When they'd be off at the same time, each of the barrel girls disappeared.    Fuck, they did this for years.    Mm hm.  I gotta take this.  I'm, uh, having a really tough time here.  Doing what? This.  Being with you.  Yeah, well, you should have thought of that before.  I'm sorry.  I fucked up, I know.  I do dumb things.  I'm a dumb guy.  But the one thing I did right was to get you to almost like me   because I really love you.    Don't, Quinn.  No, I mean it.  There aren't many women like you.  I know that.  You're more like   a guy.    A guy? You don't play games where I have to figure out what it is you're really thinking.  You just say it, usually with a lot of really filthy words that I've never heard before.  You're the first woman who's ever called me on my bullshit and made me take a hard look at myself.  It's made me a better person, I think.  I just don't want to lose you, that's all.  Bad news.  Not only has Jordan declined our request for another interview, but he just booked a multi city speaking deal in Europe.  Sounds like he's on the run.  No fucking way.  As of tomorrow he is untouchable, unless we can find a way to keep him here.  But, like we keep saying, we still don't have enough to arrest him.  No, but, uh we can ground him as a material witness.  We just have to get a court order.    Should we go to LaGuerta?   No.  She shoots me down every time.  She won't help.  I can get it myself.  The only van that remains after 24 hours just happens to be a rental.  Judging by the amount of dust, it's been sitting there close to a week.  And here comes Quinn, checking in before he heads to the station.  I never wanted it to come to this.  Agh! Hello.    Lumen, it's me, Emily.    What's wrong? I got a call from Jordan Chase.  He knows I talked to you.  What? How? I don't know.  You tell me.    I didn't talk to him.    What is going on? I'm scared.  He scared me.  Emily, I have no idea what's going on.  I'm going to the police.    I'll tell them everything.    No, no, don't do that.  Why? They'll protect me.  Emily, it'll just make things worse.  We'll protect you.  How? Jordan is too powerful.    He has people.    Emily You know what he did to us.  Just stay in your house.  Wait for us.  We'll be there as soon as we can.  Please, just tell me that you'll wait for us.  OK.  I'll wait, but hurry.  Please hurry.  Very nice.  You're quite the actress.  Dexter Morgan.  Please leave a message at the tone.  Dexter, where are you? Emily called.  Jordan knows she talked to us.  We have to go see her.  I hope you got voicemail.    You're Quinn's friend.    That would be me.  FYI, Stan Liddy is my name.    What are you doing?   I just need you to relax.  I'm taking us to a little place to have a little private chat, that's all.  Why? Why are you doing this? Because our mutual friend Joey Quinn hired me to look into you and I guess you know I found out some things.  So I just need you to lie there and relax.  I don't want to zap you again, but I will if I have to.    What?   Come on, now, Joey.  Is that any way to talk to your new best friend?   I told you, I don't want   Shut up and listen up.  You get your ass in your car and you drive on down to the fuel docks at Bayfront Park.  That big bust I want you to make, I need you to come and make it now.  I don't know what you think you're doing, but you got to stop it with this shit.  Oh, horseshit.  Nobody's stopping nothing.    You're the one who hired me.    And then I fired you.  Listen, boy.  This is going down with or without you.  Now, you don't get down here faster than a fuckin' jack rabbit, I'm calling in another cop and then there's no telling how this is gonna spin out.    Jesus, Liddy   Jesus ain't got nothing to do with it.  Old fuel docks, Bayfront Park, now.  Fuck.  Your buddy Quinn is on his way.  Didn't sound like he wants to come.  Well, you're a real popular fella.  Sonya.  Who's Sonya?   My nanny.    Nanny.  Well, Sonya wants to know if you want a magician for the party.  Of course you do.  \"Yes, do magician. \" Well, now, there's something I want to show you.  Looky here at this.  Ain't that neat? And that's just a tiny bit of what I recorded.  But I only got one problem here.  I didn't have no search warrant and these people are sticklers for rules, which is why you're gonna give me a full confession.    Where's Dexter?   He's not here.  No, I need you both.  You said you would protect me.  Emily, it's OK.  Calm down.  You have to call him.  Make him come.  Now.  OK.  OK, maybe I should just go get him.  Maybe not.  I ain't stupid.  You're thinking, \"I got no reason to make a full confession. \" So I'm gonna give you a reason.  Lumen walks free.  Why should I trust you? Cos I don't give a shit about her, and I don't give a shit about you either.  I just want my goddamn job on the police force back.  I bring in somebody like you, I get my picture in the news, everybody thinks I'm a goddamn hero, everybody loves me, and they have to hire me back.  So I don't need your girl.  What do you say? Shit! Liddy! Ah! Go away, Quinn.  Don't make this any worse.  Liddy, where the fuck are you? Leave a message.  Liddy, it's Quinn.  You're really starting to fucking piss me off.  Dexter, where are you? Emily called.  Jordan knows she talked to us.  We have to go see her.  I don't have time to deal with you.    Please leave a message.    I'm on my way.  Morgan.  My office.  I got a call earlier from the judge you petitioned for your court order.    When's it coming?   It's not.  What? Your request to detain Jordan Chase as a material witness was denied.  That fuck is scheduled to fly out of here one way today.    This was our shot.    I understand why you're upset, but what I don't understand is why you didn't come to me.    You're kidding.    I'm asking.  You are the last person I think of when I need support.  Detective, you've been on the force long enough to know that situations are rarely black and white.  Politics come into play.  That doesn't mean that I signed up to be used.  We all get used, and in this instance you should have used me.  You made it very clear that you don't support my vigilante theory.  And I'm still not sure that there's anything to it, but I have always trusted your instincts as a cop.  You know, at one point I actually thought we were friends.  Well, Detect Debra, I'm sorry if I betrayed that friendship.  OK.    Wait.    What? What?   What is it?   Here.    What is this?   It's your court order.  From a different judge who owed me a favour.  Fuck me.  Now I'm the asshole, right? You better get going if you want to catch Jordan.  Right.  Lumen? What could he be doing that is so important that he would let you come here by yourself?   I don't know.    Yes, you keep saying that.  You're surprisingly short of answers.  Maybe you should let me call him.  Yes, brilliant, because you certainly wouldn't tip him off in any way.    I could try calling him.    Quiet, please.  Are you mad at me? I did exactly what you told me to do.  Please, shut up.    I'm just trying   Shut up!   It's not my fault.    Of course it's your fault! Aah! I find this profoundly distasteful.  I've never had to do anything before! Now I've no choice.  I can't leave any witnesses.  No, you said you wouldn't kill her.  Lumen.  Lumen? Is this the only kind of love I'll e\u00ce\u00bder find? The kind that ends in blood?   Can I help you?   I'm looking for Jordan Chase.  I have a court order that prevents him from leaving Miami.  Well, I guess I can go home, then.    Is he on the plane?   No.  I have no idea where he is.  We were scheduled to fly out over an hour ago and he never showed up.  Emily was killed with two blows.  Lumen was here.  Multiple footprints in the blood, a scuffle.  More blood, not from Emily, leading out.  She was running.  She's putting up a fight.  Lumen.      Previous EpisodeNext Episode"

She saw everything.  This is what happened to the girls before you.  Boyd wasn't the only one who did this to me.  There were others.  That last fucking bitch is alive.  Someone tried to move the girls in the barrels.    Where's the driver?   He took off.  That means he's still mine to find.  You believe some people deserve to die? Some people don't deserve to live.  His name's Cole Harmon.  If this is gonna end badly, will you please just tell me now?   I might have a job for you.    And what would that be? Looking into someone.  Dexter Morgan.  As far as Quinn goes, I suspended him.  To protect your brother.  I trusted you.  And while you were fucking me you were spreading shit about my brother behind my back.  Fuck you.  You're backing off this thing cos you're porking that guy's sister.    Your blood results are in.    Emily Birch.  She's not a victim.  She's alive.  It was almost 20 years ago.  He was Eugene Greer.  That's Jordan Chase? With Lumen, I'm someone different.  In her eyes I'm not a monster at all.    I'm glad you didn't touch any of them.    Why is that? Because this DNA test will clear you and leave you all to me.  We may have a vigilante on our hands.  One of the barrel girls escaped and now she's after the men that abducted her.  Maybe she had help.  A husband, boyfriend Argh! You're gonna give me a full confession.  Liddy! Liddy, it's Quinn.  You're really starting to fuckin' piss me off.  You said you wouldn't kill her.  Lumen! Is this the only kind of love I'll ever find? The kind that ends in blood? Where are you? You've been in this situation before, Dexter, and I don't need to tell you how it ended, with Rita dead.  I haven't forgotten.  Those aren't gonna do you a lot of good without Jordan.    I'll find him.    How? All the girls were raped and tortured at the same location.  I'm pretty sure that's where he's taking Lumen.  Pretty sure.  That sounds like an assumption.  It's more than that.  Jordan's like me.  He needs his routine.  Deb put together a file with all of Jordan's real estate holdings.  It has to be one of them.    Another assumption, Dexter?   It's all I have to go on.  Lumen sees me for what I really am, and she hasn't turned away from me, she hasn't turned against me.  She's someone I could share my life with.  I will not let her die.  Surprise! Dexter! What are you guys doing here? It was Astor's idea.  I thought we'd come surprise you and have Harrison's birthday party here in Miami.    Are you surprised?   Boy, am I! I've been telling him all morning he's gonna see his father.    He couldn't sleep, he was so excited.    So happy to see his dad.  Don't worry, we're not moving in.  We're staying at the Econo Lodge down the street.    Do you want to have breakfast with us?   Yeah, come on, Dex! I wish I could, but there's a situation at work.  I really have to go.  Oh, well, Astor and Cody had something they wanted to ask you.  Can we do it later? I just don't have time right now.  All I heard on the trip was Dexter, Dexter, Dexter.  It'll just take a minute.  What is it? We want to stay with you for the summer.  Can we please, Dex? We really, really miss you.  Sure you can.  I really miss you guys too.  Chase's private jet was fuelled and sitting on the runway.  His pilot was all dressed up with nowhere to go because Chase never showed up at the airport.    You checked his home?   And his office.  I think he knows we're onto him.  Probably holed up somewhere or he's on the run.  I want to put out an APB, throw out the net, see if we snag him.  We'll need an arrest warrant for that, and no judge would grant it.    We don't have enough evidence.    We gotta try.  We can't just let that fucker slip through our fingers.  We could issue a stake and notify.  Locate him, put him under 24 hour surveillance until we've got enough to bust him.  That's fucking great.  Where were you last night? I had a couple things crash down on me.  I heard about Chase.  The fucker vanished? Yeah, but LaGuerta just OK'd a stake and notify.  Do you think your vigilantes in love got to him? Killing Jordan Chase is not the same as killing Boyd Fowler.  This guy doesn't take a piss without bodyguards holding his dick.    So it's still a race.    A race? To see which couple gets to him first.  Us or the vigilantes.  Assuming they're a couple.  Assuming we're a couple.  I can't assume anything right now.  I'm gonna go review the rape DVDs.    What for?   In case we missed anything.  Or something can get us Jordan.  Hello, Dexter.  Nice to hear from you.  Whatever you're thinking of doing, it's not necessary.    We can work something out.    Nice try.    What do you mean?   The unemotional approach.  But it's not working for you.  You're stressed.  I can hear it in your voice.    She really means a lot to you, doesn't she?   Yes.  It must be terrible, going through this again.  Losing your wife, the woman you loved.  And now Lumen.  It's I imagine it seems to you like some kind of terrible curse.  Think whatever you want.  Just listen to me.  I'll turn myself over to you.  I appreciate the offer, but I'm afraid I must decline.    Then tell me what you want.    I have what I want.  And the longer I stay on the phone, the better your chances of finding me.    So this conversation's over.    Jordan.  Tick tick tick, Dexter.  That's the sound of Lumen's life running out.  So Lumen's still alive.  Let me out! \u00c2\u00a1Oye! \u00c2\u00bfFruta? Shit.  Jordan Chase! Come on, come on.  \u00c2\u00a1Oye! \u00c2\u00bfQu\u00c3\u00a9 co\u00c3\u00b1o es eso? Jordan's real estate holdings.  Lumen has to be at one of them.  Hey.    Hey.    Please! Stop!   Any luck on Jordan?   No, not really.  Except for that.  You see that? You see how Cole keeps looking off at somebody behind the camera?   You're right.    He's not the only one, either.  In all these videos, these bastards, they keep looking off as if to get approval or instruction or something.    You think they're looking at Jordan?   Who else would it be? It's what this guy does for a living.  He tells people what to do, how to live their lives.  I know it's not any evidence or anything, but he's there, he's there, I can feel it.    You shouldn't look at those any more.    I have to fuckin' look at these things.  I understand what these women went through.  Part of it, at least.  I know what it is to be taken by some sick bastard She can't even say his name.  Rudy.  My brother.  to know you're gonna die.  Is this what I do? Curse everyone around me? I have to work.  If Jordan gets away with this I can't live with myself.  I know.  Commercial real estate.  Strip mall.  Condos.  Parking garages.  Would you keep a hostage in any of those places for two weeks? Where? Next to the doughnut shop? It's all too exposed.  Jordan must own other properties.    It's right in front of you.    What? Remember your target, where he came from, who he was.  Jordan wasn't always Jordan Chase.  Office of County Records.  This is Dexter Morgan with Miami Metro Homicide.  I need a property records check.    Name?   Eugene Greer.    Spell it.    G R E E R.  Check back with me tomorrow morning.  No, this is an emergency.  I need it right away.  There's no right away in this equation.  I got a pile of shit ahead of me and they're all emergencies.  This isn't some developer who's about to miss a filing deadline.  A woman's life is on the line.  If you don't do this now, she will die and you could have done something to stop it.  Understand me? This can't wait.  Everyone, I need your attention.  Hello? Yeah.  OK.  I got your number.  I'll get back to you as soon as I have something.  Thanks.  We're rolling out to Bayfront Park.  We have an officer down.  Stan Liddy.    Liddy?   Yes.  He's dead.  What do we know, Lieutenant? A pedestrian spotted blood coming out of a parked van, called it in.  Unis found Liddy's body inside.  Morgan, Quinn, you're running point on this, so take whoever you need.  Anyone but me.  Dexter, grab your kit.  There's a lot of blood.  OK, that's all, people.  Our crime scene's right across the bay so we're taking the boat.  Grab your gear and load up.  Dex.  Blood.  Come on.  The sooner we get this cleaned up, the sooner I can get back on Chase.  Sorry.  You can't rest here.  I know you're tired, but it's just a little further.  Jordan's had Lumen for 12 hours.  Each second I'm stuck on this slow boat going to my own crime scene takes her farther away from me.  Fate is hardly lending a hand.  You OK? I know you and Liddy were friends.  I helped him with a couple of things but I wouldn't say he was an actual friend.  It's just that you looked a little pale when we left the station.  I'm fine.  You have any idea what might have happened to him? Not a clue.  What about you? Any theories? I haven't examined the crime scene.  Wild guess? I heard Liddy was kind of shady.  Maybe something came back to bite him.  It's possible, I guess.  Lieutenant, there's something you really need to see.  Holy shit.  Someone really did a number on him.    Did you bring your full kit, Dex?   Yep.  And all my kill tools.  Hey, if you're not up to this, I can handle it.    What is it?   I don't know how to say it.    Say what?   Quinn, come with me, please.    What's going on?   It's OK, Deb.  You have a homicide to work, Detective.  Get to it.  Looks like the van was rigged with surveillance equipment.  What the hell was Liddy watching?   Me.    No way to tell.    Everything's been stripped clean.    The killer covering his tracks.  Seems to me we find out who Liddy was spying on, we find our killer.  The unis found Liddy's cellphone.  The last five calls he made were all to you.  Want to tell me what that's about? The man had demons, Lieutenant.  Your firing him didn't help.  He just needed someone to hear him out.  I was the only friend he had left.  OK, but he must have kept calling you for a reason.    What was it?   I didn't pick up.  Then he would have left messages.  I need to hear them.  Detective That looks like blood.  Quinn, you'd better start talking to me.  I don't think I should say anything else.  Not until I speak to a lawyer.  A lawyer? I'm sorry, Lieutenant.  You can talk to your lawyer back at the station.  Officer.  Escort Detective Quinn back to Metro Homicide.    Dexter?   Well, there's no castoff.  We're looking at a single thrust, expertly applied.  Good to see I did something right.  Passive blood pooling.  I guess he was probably held down as the knife went in.  Died instantly.    So the killer knew what he was doing.    Sure felt like it at the time.    Any idea what that's all about?   None.  Are you finished? Yeah, I got to catch a ride back to the lab, run some tests.  OK.  Am I the only one who's interested in this goddamn murder?   Hello?   I got a hit.  There's one property belonging to a Eugene Greer.  It's listed as a River Jordan Camp for Boys and Girls.    River Jordan?   It went bankrupt, like, 20 years ago.  A camp.  Jordan took Lumen back to where it all started with Emily.    You still there?   Yeah.  You have an address?   Thanks.    Any time.  Where's Quinn going?   The station.    Why? It looks like he may be involved in Liddy's murder.    That's crazy.    I know.  It is.    But he requested an attorney.    An attorney? Has Quinn said anything to you about Liddy, anything I should know about? No.  Nothing.    I'm gonna go talk to him.    No.  You're gonna stay here and do your job.  I hope I'm wrong about Quinn, but right now we need to process the scene and find out what really happened.  You remember this place? Should feel like home.  Well, don't worry.  It'll all come back to you.    What are you gonna do to me?   What do you think? What choice have you left me? The two of you.  Hm? I spoke with Dexter on the phone.  I let him know that you're alive in need.  I motivated him.  Hm! Now, will he come for you? You know best, but I believe he will.  And then what? We'll be joyously reunited.  The three of us.  Hm! Mm.  You've changed since I saw you here last time.  You know that? You You've got this look in your eye.  Did you learn that from him? Well?   I thought you just liked to watch.    Well, maybe I'm changing.  Like you.  Oh, God!   Where's Quinn?   Interrogation room.  Waiting for his attorney.    Did he say anything?   No.  It's not getting any better for him.  What does that mean? His name's on the requisition forms for the surveillance equipment we found in Liddy's van.  What about the fingerprints we lifted off the van? Aside from Liddy's they're all Quinn's.    I want to talk to him.    Feel free to try.  He won't speak to any of us.  You shouldn't be here, Deb.    LaGuerta says you asked for a lawyer.    That's right.  Before your lawyer gets here, why don't you tell me what the fuck is going on? I think I'd better just keep my mouth shut.  I'm not asking you as a detective.  I'm asking you as someone you live with, someone that you said you loved.  I think I deserve to know what the fuck is going on.  All I can tell you is that I didn't kill Liddy.    But you were there.    It's not what it looks like.    It looks like you did it.    I know.  If you didn't kill Liddy, who did? I can't say anything else.  I'm sorry.  Don't say you're sorry.  Just tell me the fucking truth.  You should go work on finding Jordan.  Jordan Chase was goading you on the phone, trying to get you to make a mistake.    He'll be waiting for you.    I know.  You need to stay alert, pay attention.  You don't know what he's planning for you.  Same thing I'm planning for him.  Yeah, but on his home turf.  Don't underestimate your adversary, Dexter, not again.  Could you just trust me for once? Shit! Surprise.  Get up.    Hey.  You OK?   Yeah.  Fine.    You look tired.    Thanks.  Look, like I said, we'll know more after Dexter tests the blood on Quinn's shoe.  In the meantime, have some faith.  Faith? Whatever you call it.  Don't assume the worst.    Detective Morgan?   Yeah.  Sorry for intruding.  It's from your stake and notify.    Should I put it on your desk?   What is it? Someone said they spotted Jordan Chase.    A street vendor?   Yeah, up by Muralia Road.  He thought he heard noises coming from the trunk.  That's why he called it in.  I know, sounds unlikely.  Yeah.  Maybe I'll check it out.  Thanks.  It was inevitable that this would happen.  Two broken people going through intense shared experience against a common enemy.  I do it in my seminars all the time.  It produces a sense of deep, deep bonding.  I'm sure you feel like you actually have something, even love, doesn't it? Let her go.  You lost your wife, Rita.  You blamed yourself, sure.  And you thought what? That you could make up for that by helping her?   No.    Well, then, what were you thinking? That you could be a hero? Hm.  You can't save one thing to make up for another, Dexter.  It's not the way the world works.  Wow.  I look at these, and I can't help but think that you have a kind of greatness in you.  Then I look at you, and you're no different than the idiots that show up at my seminars.  Totally lost.  I'm gonna put you out of your misery.  Both of you.  You fucking, motherfucking Era \u00c3\u00a9l, el hombre en la televisi\u00c3\u00b3n.  Jordan Chase.  Estaba esperando las luces.    He was waiting for the traffic light?   S\u00c3\u00ad.  And what about the noise in the trunk? I fuckin' swear I'm taking Spanish after this.  The sound in the uh uh trunko? Oh, s\u00c3\u00ad, tiene algo en el maletero.  \u00c2\u00a1Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang!   Bang, bang, bang! From the trunk?   S\u00c3\u00ad.  Which Which way did Uh \u00c2\u00bfDon Donde fue? What's down that way?   \u00c2\u00bfQu\u00c3\u00a9?   Nada mucho, un campamento.  A campamento?   A camp?   S\u00c3\u00ad, camp.  Thank you.  Uh Gracias.  You'll want to be awake for this.  What do you call it? Being present in the moment? So you were listening? Mm? I heard the words, but to be honest you have to consider the source.  You should be the one to do it.  Is that OK with you? He's yours.  Oh! Please! You're acting like there's some polite way to do this, some some etiquette.  Killing is killing, Dexter.  Let's at least be honest about that.  You're being honest, Eugene? You think that's an insult? It's a compliment.  It's a reminder of how far I've come.  And how far is that? You're right back where you started, only this time you're strapped to a table.    I'm transformed.    You will be soon.  Not just me.  You, Lumen You don't get to use my name.  Really? If we're not on a first name basis, the three of us, then who is? Look at you.  You're transformed too.  You're beautiful.  And you know what? If you hadn't met me, you would never have known you had it in you.    I wouldn't have had it in me   Well, now you do! Shut up! It's truly amazing.  You should thank me.  That's not what's gonna happen.  I watched you so carefully the last time you were here.  You used to just cower and cry! That's not just for me.  That's for everyone that you hurt.  Even Emily.  Do you hear me? Do you hear me?! I'm sorry.  I know that's not how you're supposed to do it.  Well, he was right about that part.  There is no polite way.  Maybe we should just leave the body here.  We don't want a murder investigation.  We want closure.  So he just vanishes like the others? Jordan's car is outside.  We'll use it to move the body.  Then maybe a month from now we'll tip off Miami Metro about this place.  Everyone will know what he's done.  Don't move.  Don't fucking move.  Whatever's in your arms, drop it now.  Both of you.  I know who you are.  Number 13.  And I know what they did to you.  I've seen the tapes.  I watched them over and over.  It's a miracle you survived.  A fucking miracle.  And you, whoever you are, you know that too.  I said, don't fucking move! Maybe it's true some people deserve to die, but I'm a cop, and I don't make that fucking decision.  So I'm gonna call this in.  In an hour, this place will be swarming with police.  If I were you, I'd be gone by then.  I don't know what you did or didn't do.  And for some reason you're not saying.  But I'm not judging.  I can't judge.  Not any more.  What do you mean? Did something happen? Yes.  A lot, actually.  A lot that I don't understand.  You know how LaGuerta keeps saying everything's complicated? I'm starting to believe her.    I'm glad you're here.    Are you? More than you know.  I'll be here, no matter what happens.  Did you ever think we'd get here?   You didn't?   Not really, no.  I mean, for a while there I wasn't sure.  It's like what your sister said.  It's a miracle.  It's a fucking miracle.  Home? I thought you'd be getting ready for Harrison's birthday.  LaGuerta said this couldn't wait.  She also said you broke the barrel girls case.  I didn't break it.  I found the place where they shot the DVDs, this camp where everything happened.  Jordan's missing, though.  Just like the rest of them.  Think it was your vigilantes? Maybe.  At least then we'd know he was dead.  That's just a crazy theory.  What about that? The blood on Quinn's shoe, is it Liddy's? I haven't run it yet.  Do you think it is? I don't know.  You think you know someone and then it turns out you don't.  You think someone's a good cop and then they do something.  I don't know.  All I'm saying is nothing is as simple as it seems.  You're right about that.  Tell me as soon as you know.  I know already.  Hey, you're up.  I bought some stuff for pancakes.  You don't know this about me, but I'm actually kind of a breakfast connoisseur.  The party's today.  Harrison's birthday.  You'll get to meet Cody, finally.  Actually, you'll get to meet a lot of people.  Everybody from the station.  Oh, and the kids want to spend the whole summer here, so we should probably talk about that.  What? What is it? I didn't sleep at all last night.  First I was wondering what was happening to me, and then I was wondering how I could possibly tell you.  Tell me what? I have to leave.    What?   Today.    You can't.    I have to.  When I saw Jordan Chase's body disappearing into the ocean, I Something happened.  And all night I was trying to figure out what was happening, and I tried to hold on to it.  But this morning I I could tell it was gone.  I don't feel it any more.  The need.  Her dark passenger.  It's vanished.  Say something.  Please? Anything.  Just Just talk to me.  Don't go.  You can't.  I don't want to.  Then don't.  Stay here.  I can't do it any more, what we've been doing.  You don't have to.  But you do.  Right? We both know that.  It's who you are.  You're right.  About everything, you're right.  We're not the same.  I'm so sorry.  Don't be.  Don't be sorry your darkness is gone.  I'll carry it for you.  Always.  I'll keep it with mine.  Happy birthday, Harrison.  Happy anniversary.  Thank you.  Only it's not our anniversary.  I saw you.  With Deb.  Trying so hard.  It makes me want to do the same.  Want to give it another shot? Go back to the beginning? Yes.  Yes.  Dexterous! So, Dex, be honest with me.  Is it weird to bring a date to a first birthday party? No, Vince.  I'm glad you brought her.  Oh, no, I didn't mean me.  I meant your sister.  There she is! The detective who solved the barrel girls case.  Thank you.    For what?   The blood work.  Just doing my job.  Yeah, well, that was the one thing hanging me up.  I owe you one.  I'm gonna go get a drink.  You could have told me sooner that the blood work cleared him.  Channels.  LaGuerta wanted to give you the good news.    You don't like Quinn much.    I don't like Quinn at all.  But I want you to be happy.  I am.  I'm happy.  You must be too.  Now that this is all over, I mean.  They make it look so easy connecting with another human being.  It's like no one told them it's the hardest thing in the world.  Where is she? Your tenant who was staying at the house.  She left.  I'm sorry.  Did you do it? What you wanted to do? You said she needed your help.  Did you help her? Yeah.  I think I did.  And did it work? Did it make you feel better? About what happened to Mom? You can't do one thing to make up for another.  That's what Jordan Chase says.  But he's wrong, because we do that all the time.  That is the way the world works.  We try to make things right.  Even me.  Come on, everybody, it's time for the cake.  Dexter.  Are you ready? Lumen said I gave her her life back, a reversal of my usual role.  Well, the fact is, she gave me mine back too.  And I'm left not with what she took from me, but with what she brought.  Eyes that saw me, finally, for who I really am.  And this certainty that nothing, nothing is set in stone.  Not even darkness.  While she was here, she made me think, for the briefest moment, that I might even have a chance to be human.  Make a wish.  Make a wish.  One, two Make a wish.  But wishes, of course, are for children.   three!       Previous EpisodeNext Episode"

So I've become an expert at blending in, camouflaging myself.  They make it look so easy, connecting with another human being.  I love you.  But if I could have feelings at all, I'd have them for Deb.  Why is it we never talk brother sister stuff? To be a brother, to have a friend I only have one person I can trust any more.  You.  To have a family   Rita's pregnant.    That's so great! If you play a role long enough, really commit, does it ever become real? Any time you let someone get close, it ends badly.  I will fuck you back! Harry was right.    I've never felt this.    You've never had a son before.  You wanna see him come into the world.  Yes.  I've never wanted anything so much in my life.  Sure, I'm still who I was, who I am.  Question is, what do I become? Camouflage is nature's craftiest trick.  Arthur's terrorised them into maintaining his cover.  They're nothing but human shields.  That's what happens to people who live with a monster.  I'm nothing like him! My family is nothing like that.  I have to be the one to kill him.  I have a family, too, Arthur.  I thought I could change what I am, keep my family safe.  But it doesn't matter what I do.  I'm what's wrong.  So what's your plan here? I can't get revenge for Rita's death.  But I can help Lumen avenge what was done to her.  In her eyes, I'm not a monster at all.  I don't feel it any more.  I'm so sorry.  Don't be sorry your darkness is gone.  I'll carry it for you.  Always.  She made me think, for the briefest moment, that I might even have a chance to be human.  But wishes, of course, are for children.  There are times in our lives when everything seems to go wrong.  When, despite our best efforts, and for no apparent rhyme or reason, tragedy strikes.    I've been stabbed.    I understand, sir.  Can you tell me your location? Please, I need help.  Team 42, we have a possible stabbing in the warehouse district.  Please stand by for approximate address.  And there are other times when everything goes just perfectly.  That's how the last year has been for me.  Hello, Ben.  Roger.  You know it's wrong what you've been doing.  What's going on? How do you know our names? Helping some of your patients live and letting others die.  Making them die so you could harvest their body parts.  The police arrested the emergency room doctor who was selling them, and that closed the case.  But I knew they must've had a regular supplier.  So I did my research, and here you are.    We were just trying to   No! You were just trying to help yourselves make some money.  That's all.  I've learned that periods of darkness can overcome us at any time.  But I've also found that I'm able to endure, overcome, and in the process, grown stronger, smarter, better.  All is well in my little corner of the world.    Dexter!   Hey, Jamie.  It's not what you're thinking.  Hey, Dex.  It's really not what you're thinking.  Angel kept an eye on Harrison while I took a really quick swim.  Thank you.  This was a great idea.  Buying the apartment next to yours? Because now you can slip in and out of your place, day or night, without anyone knowing.  I never really thought about that.  We just needed the extra space.  How's my sister working out for you? Great.  Harrison loves her.  And I love him.    He get to sleep OK?   Oh, yeah.  He's sleeping like, you know, a baby.  Except he's not a baby any more.  He's got his first preschool interview in the morning.  They grow up fast.    Good luck tomorrow.    Thanks.    I guess we should be leaving.    Yeah.  Unless you need me to stay.  I'm gonna be up studying all night, so I can do that here just as easily.  No, no.  You should go, I'm good.    OK.    But I will need you to stay late tomorrow night.  Your high school reunion, already on my calendar.    Thanks.    Bye.    But leave the shirt on.    Angel.  Hey, buddy.  Big day for you tomorrow.  We're all moving forward.  At Our Lady of the Gulf, we like to create enough structure for our children, so that they feel safe, and enough freedom so that they feel challenged.    OK.    Attendance in our preschool guarantees your child admission to our secondary school, which, as I'm sure you know, is a highly esteemed feeder school to some of the finest Ivy League universities in the country.  Harvard, here we come.  And, as I'm sure you know, we have a very rigorous admission process.  Not everyone that applies to Our Lady of the Gulf gets in.  Mr Morgan, you were referred to us by   Angel Batista.    Sergeant Batista, at the police station, where we work.  We being the people that protect you in case something bad happens.  Sergeant Batista's daughter went here, and he recommended the school.  I remember Angel.  His daughter did very well here.  So you are Catholic as well, Mr Morgan? Actually, I'm not.  And though it does have a certain appeal, I'm not sure it's right for everyone.    So, Protestant?   No.    Jewish?   No.    Muslim?   Nope.  Any religious affiliation? No.  What do you believe in, Mr Morgan? Nothing.  I don't believe in anything.  Harrison really seemed to like it in there.  He didn't wanna leave.  I think he just liked the cookies.  And he already made some friends.  You're not really sold on this place, are you? Not completely.  Is it because of the religious thing?   Partly.    What you said in there, do you really believe that? You really believe in nothing? Yeah, I suppose I believe in a certain set of principles.  What kind of principles? A set of rules on how to conduct myself in the world, so that I don't get into trouble.  I'm not the most religious person in the world, I mean, Mom practically had to drag me to church, but seriously?   What?   A set of rules to follow, so you don't get in trouble? Sounds like something I might teach a puppy.  Is that so bad? Just sounds kind of cold and empty.  Does it? Yeah.  I don't know, you can believe whatever you wanna believe.  Or not believe whatever you wanna believe.  But it's not just about you any more.  You're a father.  What about Harrison? You have to think about what you want him to believe.  Right.  Anyway, I'll see you back at the station for LaGuerta's little costume party.  OK.  To be honest, I've given a lot of thought to what I don't wanna pass on to Harrison, namely my dark passenger, but very little about what I do want to pass on.  Good afternoon to my colleagues at Miami Metro Homicide, family, friends, ladies and gentlemen of the press.  Today we join in witnessing the promotion of one of Miami Metro's finest, Maria LaGuerta.    The fuck have you been?   I had to run some errands.    What errands?   When she joined our ranks, she was appointed to the department Why do you smell like old lady? I was at the mall.  They sprayed me with cologne.  The mall? The only thing you smell like when you leave the mall is a corn dog.  It was too early for a corn dog.  Not always an easy task for a uniform.  They're looking awfully lovey dovey up there.    You think the two of them are   Gross, no way.  Matthews and LaGuerta hate each other.  Oh, yeah, just like you and Quinn used to hate each other? And now you've been living together for I'm proud to also consider my amiga cubana.  See what I mean? They do seem a little too friendly.  Ladies and gentlemen, I give you Captain LaGuerta.  One more person moving forward.  Thank you, thank you.    Captain LaGuerta.    Deputy Chief.  That was a beautiful speech.  I was touched.  It was almost as if Almost as if you'd written it yourself? Yeah.  Well, I couldn't leave anything to chance.  But you were very convincing OK, cut the crap, Maria.  Give me the book.  You know, you're lucky I'm the one who found it.  Anybody else would've thrown you to the wolves.  Can you imagine the headlines? \"Deputy Chief Matthews featured prominently \"in Miami madam's little black book. \" Please, don't talk about integrity to me.  You divorced that husband of yours as soon as you realised he was no career asset.  That is not true.    And you know that.    Save it.  I'm not interested.  Watch your step, Maria.  You're playing with the big boys now.  All right, keep it tight, everybody.  Come on, come on, come on.  Stay with me, everyone.  Stay with me.  Take a very reverent look around.  This is the home of Miami Metro Homicide.  And this is the heart of it all, my lab.  Who are you, and why are you in my way? I'm Peter, I'm one of Professor Masuka's students.    Professor Masuka?   I'm teaching both the extension and online classes in forensic pathology at the university.  Class, this is Detective Morgan and Detective Quinn.  And that is Sergeant Batista.  And this is the future of forensic science.  Well, the future looks very bright.  All right, let's go, let's go.  Right this way, right this way.  Next stop is my lab, and then the spatter room, and then what's always the last stop, the morgue.  Maybe I should teach a class.  Yeah, on how to rob a cradle.  Hey, I'm twice divorced.  Leave me alone.    Who are all those people?   The future of boring.  Nice jacket.  You getting all duded up for the big high school reunion?   Twenty years.    Speaking of schools, have you heard from Harrison's preschool yet?   Not yet.    Tick tock, Dex.  OK, OK.  I can't believe you're going to your reunion.  You're, like, the only person that hated high school more than me.  It'll be good to catch up with some of the old friends.  You're hoping to get laid.  You got me.  Janet Walker.  But I knew her as Janet McKellen.  I didn't exactly have friends in high school, but she was always nice to me.  She and Joe Walker were voted \"most beautiful couple\" our senior year.  Unlike Janet, Joe hardly knew I existed.  Joe was captain of the football team.  A real bruiser on the field.  But I remember him for the bruises he left on Janet.  They got married straight out of high school and moved to Virginia.  I'd almost forgotten about her until I noticed her obituary in the alumni newsletter.  She was found dead three years ago, an apparent suicide.  But there was blood underneath her fingernails.  How could it get there if her fingers were wrapped around the grip, pointing away from her body? It must belong to someone else.  Perhaps someone she scratched while putting up a fight.  Perhaps someone who will be at the reunion tonight.  Take us closer to the edge.  They like shallow water.  You know, Florida water snakes don't lay eggs.  They give birth to live young.  Around 20 or 30, sometimes even more.  There.  And she's pregnant.  Makes her fat and slow.  Well done.  There's a lot of them inside.  All you're gonna need is seven.  High school, a small world unto itself, combining all the warmest elements of a federal work camp with those of a third world poultry farm.  It's a miracle I graduated without killing anyone.  I was invisible in high school.  Just a shadow passing through the hallway.    Dexter!   Alan.  Best biology lab partners ever, right, dude? Oh, you bet, dude.  Man, I never saw anyone dissect a foetal pig as fast as you.  You're, like, the first student ever to ask for seconds.  That was a great learning experience.  Obviously.  Now you're some hotshot blood spatter guy.    It's awesome!   Thanks.  Hey, we should check out all these activities   they've got planned for us.    Yeah, you go on ahead.  I'm only here for one activity.  Hey, there he is.  And there he is.  Still the centre of attention.  I'm finally gonna get some use out of my class ring.  I sharpened part of it, so that I can prick Joe's hand when we shake and draw a small drop of blood.    Dexter!   Mindy.  Hey, my date to the spring formal.    Which was held right here.    What a night that was.  Hey, I'm so sorry to hear about your wife.  Oh, thanks.  Yeah, that was a horrible thing, but You know.  Right, of course.  What about you? Did you ever get married? I did.  Honey This is my wife Heather.  You're the last man that I ever dated.  Well, I'm glad if I was of any help.  Dexter, hey, Mr Blood Spatter guy.  I read about you in the paper.  Lookin' good.    Thanks.    Dexter?   Trisha.    You look fantastic.  I can't wait to sit down and catch up.    Yeah, absolutely.    Right now? There's some people I need to say hello to first.    Hey, Joe.    Hey, good to see you.  Dexter Morgan.  Wow! Looks like someone's been working out.  Yeah, doing my best.  Dexter! So sorry about your wife.    We read all about it.    Yeah.  Thank you.  You've had a personal tragedy.  Unlike everyone else, you look better than you did 20 years ago, and you've got a cool job.  Put all those things together, and it makes you   Popular.    How's it feel?   I hate it.    Come on, it's great.  Most of the people here would love to be popular.  Most of the people here don't have two rolls of duct tape, and a surgical saw in their trunk.  It's not the end of the world, Dex.  No, but it definitely makes things more difficult.  I'm used to flying under the radar.  So you're flying a little higher.  That's a good thing.  So what am I supposed to do? Enjoy it, son.  Being a blood spatter analyst really isn't so much of a job as it's a calling.  You guys are the modern American cowboys.  Yes.  Yee haw! I'm gonna go grab a refill.  All right.  Joe.  Hey.  Dexter.  What's going on, man? Nice, a sample of my own blood.    You know, life.    I know, man.  I know.  Looks like you've done pretty well for yourself over the past 20 years.  I have.  I moved to Virginia, bought a couple sporting goods stores.  It's good business.  How about you? I work for Miami Metro Homicide.    You're a cop?   No, no, I'm a lab geek.  I work in the forensics department.  Lab geek! That's who you are! Now I remember, the science brainiac.  Yep, that would be me.  Hey, I was sorry to hear about Janet.  Yeah.  That was tough.  But I understand you kind of went through the same thing? Yeah.  It's true, we both lost our wives way too early.  Sometimes life sucks.  What do you do? You know, it's been three years now, and still sometimes I get so angry with Janet doing what she did, leaving me like that.  Yeah, it must be hard on you.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Wow.  Get a look at that.  Trisha Billings.  Right.  Right, I spoke to her a little while ago.  Yes, little Miss Prom Queen still hot as ever.  You know, my one regret in high school was that I never tapped that sweet ass.  Well, you were dating Janet then.  Right.  Of course.  But I should at least go say hello.  I need to find another way to get a drop of Joe's blood.  And I think I just found it.  Come on, Dexter.  It's Hammertime.  I have no idea what \"Hammertime\" is.  Or how it differs from regular time.  Patience.  \"In the midst of the street was the tree of life, \"which bears 12 manner of fruit \"and yielded her fruit every month. \" Do you want something? I'd like some oranges, please.  Seems small without your stuff.  Had to make room for you.  I'm acting LT only.  Not if I recommend you for the position full time.  You don't owe me anything.  You know that.    Yes, I know that.    I mean, that was the deal.  We divorce, things go back the way they were   when we were still friends.    That's exactly what this is.  I'm choosing you to run Homicide, because you're the best there is.    There's no other reason.    You sure? Honestly.  OK, my motives are not unselfish.  I need someone in here who I can trust,   someone who will have my back.    I don't know.  I'm someone who needs to be on the streets.  The street can be exciting, but it's also hard.  And none of us are getting any younger.  You need to start thinking about your future here.  Besides, the prestige and salary bump can't hurt.  I know what you're saying, but How much of a salary bump? Think about it.  Fine.  But no promises.  OK, Lieutenant Batista.  Wishbone, Hail Mary, buttonhook Nothing is what it seems.  If I have any hope of blending in I need to learn this.  Just enough so that I can get close to Joe and draw a bit of blood.  Even the coffin corner isn't as fun as you'd think.  We've got a situation.  Grab your kit.  Pros only.  Everybody stay behind the yellow tape and watch me work my magic.  Watch well, and one of you will be lucky enough to become my intern.  A prize opportunity that will have to be earned.  Ten bucks the hot chick earns it.  I can't take that bet.  It's too obvious.    So what have we got?   About 3 pounds of meat.    Any body?   Not yet.  An early morning customer called it in.  Intestines.    We've covered that, Sherlock.    They're human.  These tissue tears indicate they were removed in a very crude manner.  Yeah, but where's the body? Where was the vic disembowelled? This spatter suggests the initial blow was to the head from behind.  Probably in the process of unloading.  The victim went down and he was dragged down to here.  Watch the blood.  This spray comes from a stab wound, that's likely what killed him.  And this pool of blood in the dirt suggests he was disembowelled here.  No signs of a struggle, judging from the undisturbed blood pool.  Yeah, he was either dead or unconscious when his intestines were removed.  No usable footprints through the blood? What do you think we're up against? I mean, leaving the intestines on the scale wasn't done by accident.  Well, body part removal could be drug related.  It could be Santer\u0092a, voodoo.  Let's hold on a second, folks.  Could you guys set up a larger perimeter, search the area? The body might've been dumped nearby.  Hey.  Can we talk in private?   Yeah, go ahead.    No, I mean, like, later.    Over dinner.    Why? What's the big deal? That's what I'm asking you.  You're being weird.  You're being weird.  OK, now you're being weird and stupid.  Did you buy another big screen TV for the apartment? If you bought another big screen for the apartment and you're expecting me to pay for half of it,   there's no way   I didn't buy anything.   Jesus Christ, leave me alone.    I'd return it.  I got all I need.  I'm gonna sneak back to my reunion.  I got a big flag football game to suit up for.  Did I just hear him right? You run the post corner.  Everyone else know what they're doing?   Ready!   Ready.    Let's go.    Yep, you got your man, right? This time, the plan is when Joe is at the bottom of a pile, I'll give him a quick jab and get my sample.  Eighteen! Five! Red, yellow, hike! Unfortunately, Joe never seems to go down.  Block that shit! Unlike me.  Come on, Dexter! Stay low, block high.  You gotta block that shit, Morgan.  My lancet.  No lancet means no blood sample.  Huddle up, girls.  So I want you to break outside and go deep.  Dexter, you're an offensive lineman, and it's your job to stay close to the quarterback to protect him from the rushers.  And while you're there, stick in close, give the little prick a hard jab in the nose with your elbow.  Make him bleed, Dexter.  Blue 46, hike! Shit!   Sorry, Joe.    What the fuck was that? Sorry.  Who taught you how to play football? My dad.  And we've got a blood match.  Tomorrow night, Joe is all mine.    Dexter.    Night, Angel.  Did you take Harrison for his preschool interview? Yeah, I did.  Good, cos Auri really liked it there.  She didn't find it scary? The statues, and the You know.  The crucifix.  That's a very powerful image of the sacrifice that was made for us.  All kids have to learn those kind of things.  Those kinds of things.  Sorry, but why? I only ask, because I wasn't brought up with much church experience.  No, that's OK.  These are good questions.  It's the catechism.  And they need to learn that, because God has put a desire for himself in every person.  Look, I know this is a little basic, but how do we even know there is a God? You know, just so I can explain it to Harrison.  Oh, well Well, there is a God, because in In every one of us, there is a powerful sense of moral goodness.  OK.  But honestly, when you really get down to it, it's all about faith.  It's something you feel, not something you can explain.  This is very hard to put into words.  Because it makes no sense.  Thanks, Angel, you've really made it all much more clear.  Sure.  Always happy to help.  This place is kind of fancy, isn't it? It's OK, I'm buying.  And I'm eating.  That was nice of Dexter to let you out early tonight.  Yeah, he's such a good boss.  He works around my school schedule, whatever I need.  He's a good guy.  With all he went through last year, you know, losing his wife I'm glad he's got you helping him out.  Yeah, so sad.  Well, I think he's putting it all behind him at least.  Well, I don't know.  Some nights What? It just seems like some nights, the pain, the loneliness, whatever it is he's feeling, gets to be too much and he's gotta just disappear for a while, go out on his boat.  I think he's trying to keep it away from Harrison.  Yeah.  He really loves his son.  Poor guy needs a hobby or something.  Totally.  Thank you.  Thanks.  Can I get a nice bottle of champagne, please? Thanks.  Champagne? What is up with you? We're celebrating.  You're looking at the next lieutenant of Homicide.  You? Angel! That is so fantastic!   Wait, when did this happen?   It's not official yet.  I'm only acting LT, but, you know, it should come through any day now.  I am so happy for you.  It comes with a nice salary bump.  We can finally get out of that little apartment   and into a nice house.    Wouldn't that be so great? I could put Auri back in ballet lessons.  How's she doing? You know, a teenager.  She doesn't need her daddy any more.  It's a phase, I'm sure.  I'm sure.   Thank you.    Thanks.  What? You're kind of almost naked on top there.  You sound just like Pop.  Por favor, don't say that.  It's true.  He used to follow me when I walked to school to make sure I didn't talk to any boys.  I just don't want people thinking that you're my girlfriend.  Why would they think that? Because you just took off your top.    You're all sexualised.    Oh, my God! You're serious! I know we didn't grow up together,  but I'm your sister, Angel.    I know, I know.  She's not my girlfriend.  What? I just told her that you're not my girlfriend.  She probably thinks you're a prostitute.  Oh, my God.  I was wrong.  You're not like Pop, you are Pop.  I should beat you for that.  Exactly like Pop.  Man!   Sister?   Mr Morgan.    Good morning.    Hi.  I just wanted to apologise for the other day.  I didn't mean to come across as indifferent.  Of course not.  The fact is, I'm pretty ignorant in spiritual matters.  I had a rather unconventional childhood.  My father taught me what he thought was important.  But I guess we had some concerns that seemed more pressing   than learning about God.    I see.  But I want Harrison to have a normal childhood, a good childhood.  I would like for him to go here.  And you came all the way out here this morning just to tell me this? It seemed important.  I'll see if we can find a place for your son.  Thank you.  Hey.  I've got my intern photographing the scene.    That's your intern?   What happened to the little hottie? What are you suggesting? That I would pick Ryan as my intern simply because of her remarkable breasts and buttocks?   Yeah.    I find that incredibly insulting that you would question my integrity.  I picked the student with the highest test scores.  End of story.    So what have we got here?   Floater, washed ashore.  Some lady called it in.  He's dead.  That's your best guy? Looks like he was killed by the stab wound.  He wasn't drowned.  His body was put in the water postmortem.  So he was dumped.  Someone tried to hide the body? Vince? He wasn't in the water very long.  Three, four hours, max.  So he was dumped right offshore.  Doesn't look like somebody was trying to hide him.  No, more like they wanted the body to be found.  Last thing I need is a complicated crime scene.  Holy shit.  Someone cut him open, then sewed him back up.  And it just got complicated.  These incisions were made postmortem.  Our fruit vendor?   Omar Rivera.    That's our guy.  These stitchings are really weird.  There's, like, an \"A\" and then a horseshoe kind of thing.  It's Greek.  Alpha, omega.  How do you know Greek? I dated some sorority chicks back in the day.  Of course you did.  Holy shit, it's moving.  There's something inside.  Holy frankenfuck! Snakes! Bag 'em, bag 'em.    Got 'em all?   Yeah.    How many we got?   Seven.  Seven snakes.  Your guy just fainted.  That's not a good sign for a crime scene investigator.  Goodbye, big guy.  Hello, runner up, little Miss Hottie.  Can we get back to this, please? Snakes.  I mean, what the fuck? How does that happen? I mean, what? Did the snakes crawl inside of him? No, they're freshwater snakes.  Somebody put them there.  Somebody cut him open, took out his intestines, and replaced them with snakes.    Why?   To send a message, maybe? Dude, what kind of message does it send putting snakes in a dead guy's stomach? Some kind of warning, maybe.  Whatever the message, whoever sent it went to a lot of time and trouble.  This is no amateur.  After Joe's had a couple of drinks, I'll figure out a way to get him to step outside,   where I'll M99 him and   Dexter! Trisha.    Hi.    Hi.  I was hoping I'd see you before the weekend was over.  Oh, well, here I am.  Shall we? If it wasn't for you, I'd have never made it through high school.  You saved my life.  I saved your How? We had so many classes together, and I'd always sit right behind you.  Every test we took, I'd copy all your answers.    It's how I got through.    Oh, well, I never noticed.  That's OK.  That makes us even.  I never noticed how cute you are.  Until now.  Oh, my God, Mr Smith's class.  This is it.  You helped me a lot in this classroom.  Maybe I should give you a little something back.  Trisha, I don't have time for this.  Yes, you do.  This is really Stop talking, Dexter.  Oh, God, what did I get myself into? This is never good.  That was so good.  Thanks, sweetie.  Your purse.    Bye bye.    Bye bye.  Whoa, that was easy.  Trisha, you bad girl.  What is this? Trisha? You here? What the fuck? Fast reflexes.  I hate jocks.    It's you.    I'm a mighty panther.  I'm the gold and red.  Jesus, you still are some weird loser.  What the fuck's up with you? Tonight is meant for victory.  It's time to make you dead.  I don't think that last line is right.  I'm pretty sure it is.  Welcome back.  What the hell is going on? Why'd you do it, Joe?  Why'd you kill Janet?   What? Who said I killed Janet? I didn't kill Janet.  I was No more lies.  I'm a blood spatter expert, remember? I see things others miss.  You shot Janet, then put the gun in her hand.  No, I came home and I found her OK, OK, OK.  But I had to.  Yeah? Why? Why'd you have to? Because we were having problems, and the marriage was over.    And   And so you killed her? Do you know how expensive a divorce is? Really? That's your answer? What would Jesus have done? Seriously now.  How do you reconcile your belief in a higher power, in a god, with what you've done? What difference does it make? I'm just curious.  So what, I'm supposed to defend my beliefs to you? If you don't mind.  Look, I mean, everyone makes mistakes.  And they do things that they shouldn't do.  And they're only human.  But God, see, God forgives us.  Really, it's as simple as that? You kill someone, God forgives you for it?   Yes.    So I could kill you   and God would forgive me?   Well, no.    You just said he would.    You have to truly repent.  Do you truly repent for killing Janet?   Yes, definitely.    Liar.  No, no, you don't wanna do that!   Why is that?   Cos If you let me go, God will give you life everlasting and whatever you want.  There's really nothing I need.  You know, you don't wanna You don't wanna make God mad.  Don't you hear how foolish you sound? Because he will smite you with swords and rocks and thunder.  Thunder is just the noise.  It would be lightning.  You cannot kill me, for God is a mighty fortress.  Joe, please, stop.  And I have been washed with the blood of the lamb and he will protect me! Sorry, hammer time.  So I talked to the coast guard today, and they confirmed what we'd already figured.  With the tides and all that, that body was probably tossed in the water no more than a 1/4 mile offshore.  Really? You don't seem very interested.  No, of course I'm interested.  I just Don't really wanna talk about work.  What is going on with you? You're acting so weird lately.  I'm not acting weird, I You're about to drink the candle.  I'm just gonna use the restroom.  Debra will you marry me? God, I sound like a fucking idiot.  Thank you.  Get down, get down, get down! Fuck! He's wearing Kevlar.  Don't fuckin' move! You all right? Yeah.  Life is good.  I'm not at all unhappy.  I'm quite content to go about my life believing in nothing, with no fear that there might be something more out there.  \"I stood upon the sand of the sea, \"and I saw a serpent rise up out of the sea, \"having seven heads. \" \"And upon his heads, the name of blasphemy. \" So it's begun? Yes.  It's begun.  But I also have a son, and I have to think about what he wants and what's best for him, because who knows? Maybe he'll grow up to be someone who wants to think about those kinds of things.      Previous EpisodeNext Episode"

It could be Santer\u0092a, voodoo.  Attendance in our preschool guarantees your child admission to our secondary school.  So you are Catholic? Actually, I'm not.  What do you believe in, Mr Morgan? Nothing.  I don't believe in anything.  You can believe whatever you want to believe, but it's not just about you any more.  What kind of father keeps blood slides in his apartment? Ladies and gentlemen, I give you Captain LaGuerta.  Seems small without your stuff.    Had to make room for you.    I'm acting LT only.  Not if I recommend you for the position full time.  What is going on with you? You're acting so weird lately.  Debra, will you marry me? God, I sound like a fucking idiot.  Get down, get down! Everybody down!   What have we got here?   Floater, washed ashore.  Some lady called it in.  Doesn't look like somebody was trying to hide him.  More like they wanted the body to be found.  There's something inside.  Holy frankenfuck! Snakes! This is no amateur.  So it's begun? Yes.  It's begun.  Until a few days ago, I was convinced there was nothing I believed in.  But I was wrong.  There is something I truly believe.  Everything's better after a bubble bath.  Rituals are important.  Not just for a serial killer, but also for a two year old, if you want him to go to bed on time.  Put him back.  Not that I mind, this ritual has become my favourite.  Bedtime.  Alone with my son.  Being myself.    Monster story, Daddy.    Again? OK, I may have told him this one before.  Once upon a time there was a little chino, scaring everyone who lived in the hood.  Nobody knew what to do.  But Daddy did.  He would slay that icky monster, hiding what was left of him in a special place that no one would ever find.  Daddy's box.  You know about Daddy's box? I always knew this day would come.  Just not so soon.  I'm not sure how this next chapter goes.    Is that the last of them?   Just one more to go.  We'll be ready soon.  I may be a little late tomorrow.  And you tell me that now? Can't help it.  It shouldn't take long.  Nothing's changed.    Travis, we have to find another.    Don't you think I already know that? Now look what you've done.    I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to.    No, it's OK.  It's OK.  These things happen.  I just want to make sure that I can rely on you.    Of course.    Good boy.  Hello.  Wow.  Full on breakfast.  Yeah, juice is in the fridge.  Freshly squeezed.  Fresh squeezed.  Well, aren't we the fucking Kennedys.  A good breakfast is a good way to start the day.  Yeah, another day of sitting on our asses, waiting for OIS to clear us on the restaurant shooting.  Pancakes? You do realise the bar is set very high with me and pancakes.  My dad's were the best.  What the fuck? What are you doing? I wanted to do this the other night, but the shooting sort of messed everything up.  Debra Morgan, will you   Are you insane?   Come on, Deb.  I'm trying to be fucking romantic here.  Romantic isn't springing something like this on me.  When have we ever talked about marriage? Will you get up? Come on, Deb, we've been at this for a year.  You make me happy, I make you happy.    So?   So   I love you.    But This is huge! You don't like the ring? Is it the ring? No, it's It's beautiful.  It's just I just need time to think about this.  Take all the time you need.    I'm not going anywhere.    Pancakes are burning.  Quinn just fucking proposed to me over fucking pancakes.  What the fuck is wrong with him? He's Quinn? I never said I wanted to spend the rest of my life with him.  So I take it this means it's a \"no\"? I can only hope.  Quinn as Deb's boyfriend is one thing.  Uncle to my son, over his dead body.  Maybe.  I don't know.  I mean, I guess Quinn makes me happy.  Really? Cos there's a vein in your forehead.  Quinn and I, we get along great, and there's no drama.  And after the last couple years, that's kind of nice.  But? But I'm not sure I want anything more than no drama right now.  Sounds like you have your answer.  But if I tell him \"no,\" then it's over, right? And I'm not sure I want that, either.  God, why can't things just stay the same? Tell me about it.  Come on, we're gonna be late for the briefing.  Watch this.  She totally decks him.    She flattened that guy.    Where was Quinn?   She's already got 500,000 hits.    Hey, hey, she's coming.  Nice.  Yeah, yeah, I'm a hero.  Fuck you very much.  You've totally gone viral, Morgan.  You're an Internet sensation.  Give it a rest, man.  What? Dude, she's a superstar.  I mean, have you guys read the comments She has, and if you're the one that wrote the poem about my ass I know not of what you speak.  And it was a limerick, thank you.  Can we get started, please? All right, everyone, settle down.  Where are we with ballistics from the restaurant shooting? All casings and bullets are accounted for.  All the victims were shot by the shooter's gun and no stray bullets from Morgan or Quinn.  The shooter talking? He was pissed off the restaurant fired him.  The manager was the first to go down.  Two dead, all because this asshole wanted his job back waiting tables.  All right, with the shooting behind us, we put everything into finding out who did this to Omar Rivera.  Dex, the ME report come back on the fruit vendor? Nothing we didn't already know.  The stitches and the snakes are definitely post mortem.  I and my lovely new intern Ryan are still waiting for the medical examiner to return our snakes.  Keep me updated.  Yale is looking into our vic.  Rivera had ties with the Salas Cartel.  You still thinking this is drug related? Well, to a cartel, a snake is a snitch.  If this wasn't a warning to others to keep their mouths shut, I'm not sure what the message is.  Maybe because the message is in a language only I understand.  What is that holy piece of shit doing here? I know that piece of shit.  Or at least I did.  Rivera worked at Brother Sam's garage after he got out of jail.  Hey, I don't like it any more than any of you.  Maybe the padre points us in the right direction.  Guys like that and his ex con fucking friends can go to hell for all I care.    Brother Sam?   One big, bad ex con turned minister.  Runs an auto body shop using former inmates.  And, as you can see, some of our brothers in blue think it's a sham.  They may be right.  That can't be a man of the cloth.  That's a killer.  Settled in next door.  Well, that would explain the smell of perfume.  I was wondering, have you gotten around to finalising   Sergeant Batista's paperwork?   I'm on top of that.  Because I haven't seen anything come across my desk.  I think the sooner the department has a full time lieutenant, the better.  I could not agree more.  Is that all, Captain? That's all.  When's the last time you saw Rivera? A few months ago.  He came in.  He needed some brakes for his pickup.  He brought everybody grapefruits and oranges.  It was a good day.  So are you Are you guys any closer to finding out who did this to him? Well, that's why you're here.  But I need something to go on.  When I knew Brother Sam, he was Samuel Wright.  A string of holdups led to the inevitable.  One of his victims fought back and Wright killed him.  I was ready to make my move until a drug bust took Wright off my table.  And you never saw Rivera hanging out with any of his old crew? No, I didn't.  Omar had moved past that world.  He was on a righteous path.  It's funny, cos I remember you saying the same thing about the last ex con you vouched for.  Remember Victor Torres? He gets paroled and goes out and kills a 19 year old girl.  There's not a day that goes by that I don't pray for that girl or reach out to her family.  Well, her blood's on your hands.  There's a lot more than that girl's blood on my hands.  My past, the things that I've done, the life that I lived, is haunting me to this day.    Bullshit.    I don't give a rat's ass what you think about me, you understand? Or the work that I do or the men that I do it with.  What I do know is this: Omar did not have this coming.  His demons were gone.  Men can change.  Men, maybe.    Are we done?   Yeah.    Thanks for coming in.    OK.  But what about a monster? You wanted to see me, sir? I remember when I had this office.  Miami was a different place.  Corruption was everywhere.  My dad said you never knew who you could trust back then.  Harry was one of the good ones.    And so are you.    Thank you, sir.  That means a lot.  It's why I'm making you Homicide's new lieutenant.  Me, right.  Lieutenant.  Fuckballs, you're serious.  Sir.  You're exactly what this department needs.    A fresh face, new ideas.    Wait, really? You want me in charge? I don't even know what to say.    Well, \"yes\" would work.    But this is Batista's job.  He's expecting it.  He's earned it.  Well, Sergeant Batista's a fine officer, but he comes with certain baggage.  Besides, he's not a hero.  You are.  Why does everyone keep saying that?   I was just doing my job.    That's not how I see it.  That's not how the city sees it.  No.  This office needs someone like you.  Oh, my God.  Dexter would flip out.  And poor Masuka.  I'd be that little fuck's boss.  I'd be everybody's boss.  This is an honour.  Do you really think I'm ready for something like this? Listen, I know this is a lot to take in.  We can talk about it more tomorrow, OK? Congratulations, Lieutenant.  Lieutenant.  What the fuck is going on today? Keep your eyes on the bouncing ball and not on Daddy's bad pictures.  Samuel Wright killed this store owner in cold blood.  Bashed in his head with a bottle.  Now he's calling himself Brother Sam, professing to be a changed man.  But I can't tell if I'm seeing a man who's changed for the better or just a better cover.  Daddy's box.  You want to put this in Daddy's box? Thank you.  It seems like yesterday he was just learning to crawl.  Daddy's box.  Or he's putting all the pieces together.  What I say, what I do.  Where things go.    I'll be more careful.    Is that gonna be enough? You're looking at Homicide's new fucking lieutenant.  I know, right? Got any beer? That's quite the day.  Lieutenant.  Nope.  Two beers in and it still sounds fucking weird.  I can't do this.  And it totally dicks Batista.  What could Matthews possibly be thinking? That you're smart, you're driven, you're a great detective.  Who'll be leading the department that may hunt me down one day.  You should give yourself some credit.  You should give me another beer.  I'm empty here.  You ever wonder why Dad never made LT? He had his hands full.  With me.  Everyone talked about him like he was some super cop, but he stayed in the pen his whole career.  Maybe he never wanted it.  You know, after his funeral, a tiny part of me was relieved.  I tried so hard to get him to pay attention to me.  And I thought with him gone, I wouldn't need his approval any more, but Twenty years later, I still do.  He's still up here in my head.  You don't say.  The weird thing is, if I take this job, I'll have achieved more than he ever did on the force.  And that's the part that scares the shit out of me.  Not sure I follow.  Dad was my litmus test for what a real cop is supposed to be.  And if he never made lieutenant Then you have no one to compare yourself to.  And I don't want to be fucking LaGuerta.  So how would I even know if I was doing a good job? I'd be totally on my own on this.  Well, if you don't want the job, don't take it.  Fuck you.  Of course I want it.  Holy shit, I really want it.  Quinn, again.  What the fuck does he want? Out on a limb here, but maybe an answer as to whether you want to be Debra Quinn? Jesus H.  Fuck, I totally forgot.  Debra Quinn.  Your initials would be DQ.    Like the   I will kill you.  I have no idea what to say to him.  I've got to stall.  Can I sleep here? About one life altering decision a day is my max.  Yeah.  I'll sleep on the couch in the other room.  That's why you don't suck as a brother.  Yeah, but what about as a father? Travis! God damn it.  Really wish you wouldn't use that word.  Well, maybe I wouldn't if my brother would use the doorbell.  You really scared me.  Slow down.  And save some room for dessert.  I told you, I have to work tonight.  You're working too much.  I can see it in your face.  I like to keep busy.  You want busy, try keeping a bunch of fifth graders focused on art.  Today, all they could talk about was they found another flock of those dead birds up north.  They think it's the end of the world or something.  What if it were? Then I'd say we better eat this ice cream fast.  No, I can't stay.  I have to go.  Come on.  Blow off work for once.  For me.  I barely get to see you any more.  Well, that was before Before what? It's nothing.  Travis, we used to be so close.  We used to talk and do things.  Now it's like pulling teeth just to see you for an hour.  I miss you.  I miss you, too.  Then let me spend an evening with my baby brother.  Please? Now, who put that there? Good thing I have just the place to get this fixed.  If Brother Sam believes in giving men like this a second chance, who am I to deny him one on my table? You here about Eddie?   What?   Eddie.  You here about Eddie? His parole agent.  No, I'm just a customer.  I dinged my car.  Is Brother Sam here? He's out back.  Can I help you? Yeah.  I was hoping to get an estimate.  You're not from around here, are you? Your shop came highly recommended.    By who?   Co worker.  You out front? Was that the holy spirit? Or his dark passenger checking out mine? Yeah, my guys can have this out in a day or two.  \"Good Shepherd. \" What's that mean, exactly? Well, the men you see here, they're like my flock.  And my job is to make sure that they don't wander.  That's a lot to take on.  Yeah, well, I got a lot to answer for.  Nothing broke that can't be fixed, right? Lord have mercy.  No car is ever totalled.  Yeah, it's like a man's life.  Like a man's soul.  I ought to know that.  You know, I once killed a man and walked off scot free?   For that I need to pay.   need to pay.    I'm surprised to hear you say that.    Don't be.  The spirit moves me to tell my story and share.  I was facing death row.  The judge presiding over my case suddenly dropped dead.  Mistrial? Yeah.  It sounds like divine intervention.  Yeah.  God was playing me all right, you know.  I had to go out here and get good and high before he just said, \"Son, that's enough. \" And I get stopped.  Possession charge.  I go back to jail, but, hallelujah, praise God, that's how I got saved.  So that darkness inside is gone? No.  It's still there, but I'm fighting its ass every day.  I really don't have much of a choice, you know? I sacrificed that bad part of my soul to make up for some of the pain I caused.  Nick still hasn't showed.  You find him and you tell him I'm coming for him, you understand? Now.  Tell him now.  One of the flock get lost? Yeah, something like that.  So what do you say there, brother? I guess I'll be seeing you soon.  All right.  You have a blessed day.  Once we work our magic, we put it up on the board here.  What are the abbreviations? What was run? TR is trace.  TX, toxicology.  So where does everything go after it's been run? Inquisitive.  I like.  Evidence, down the hall.  Cool.  Yeah, medical examiner finally sent 'em over.    They don't make you squeamish?   Are you kidding?   I love this.    Me, too.  Vince.    Hands off.    She's my student.  Yeah, and a lawsuit landing on my desk if she catches you staring like that.  Sounds like someone's expecting to make Lieutenant Buzz kill.  Take these files down to Central Booking.  Have them cross referenced with the CI lab   and get back to me right away.    Yes, sir.  Wow.  You really drink that swill? Keeps me young.  How about we go around the corner and I buy you a real cup of coffee?   My treat.    OK.  Dexter, you got a minute? Yeah, I need to get to my lab.  Has Deb mentioned anything to you, you know, about us?   She may have said you proposed.    And? The pancakes weren't bad.    I fucked this up royally, didn't I?   I wouldn't know.  Look, I know you and I have had our differences, but it would really mean a lot to me if you could help me out here.    Well, this is between you and Deb.    No, I know.  It's just, I don't want her to feel like she has to, you know, choose between you or me.  She doesn't.  Because it is never going to be you.  No, I got it.    I said it was my treat.    I got it.  Here.  I can afford it.  What is it? I just wanted to let you know that I'm the detective I am because of you.  Thank you.  And you have always, always had my back.  And, more than that, you're like family to me.  Where is this going?   Don't look at me for a second.    Deb.  Angel, Matthews has asked me to be the new lieutenant.  I'm sorry.  I know how much you wanted this.  What did you say? That you should be the new lieutenant, not me.    What did he say?   He wouldn't listen.  I could never, ever do this job without your blessing, so you just say the word, and I'll tell Matthews to go fuck himself.  This It's really great.    You mean that?   Damn right.  It's about time a real cop had that job.  I couldn't be happier.  Come here.  I'm gonna need that money back, though.  OK.    Angel.    It's been a long day, Maria.  I just found out about Morgan.  I'm so sorry.  There's nothing to be sorry about.  I was on the fence about this whole lieutenant thing anyway.  Look, this has nothing to do with you.  Matthews is just using Morgan to get back at me, but it won't work.    I mean, she's barely out of diapers.    Don't do that.  Deb's a good detective.  Better than you ever were.  Look, you're angry and you have every right to be, but I will fix this.  I Enough, Maria, enough.  Angel, I'm so sorry.  How come if Matthews hates you, I'm always the one paying the price? The good shepherd has fled his field for seedier pastures.  The question is, why? It seems old habits die hard.  Brother Sam's not a changed man after all.  Hallelujah.  I can't come back for Brother Sam until I make sure he killed that man.  But while I'm checking, better safe than sorry.  I was right all along.  Brother Sam is no shepherd.  He's still a wolf.  Well, it is an animal tranquiliser.  Good doggy.  Who the fuck is out here? Sam, it's me.  I was here earlier.  The SUV.  I left my clicker for my garage in the glove compartment.  I thought it was too late to call.    Do you mind?   Sit! Eli! Sorry.  I didn't see anyone here.  I thought I would be in and out.  Your car's inside.  Maybe I should just come back tomorrow.  No.  We can get it over with now.  OK.  Eli! Appreciate it.  This isn't how I envisioned taking down Brother Sam, but it's either him or me if I want to stay Alive? Get off the man's damn car.  Can't believe you hit me, man.  I can't believe you took a shot at me.  Now I'm confused.  Take Eli out back and don't you think about running off.  I chased your ass down once.  I'll do it again.  You understand? Come on, boy.  Your missing worker.  You know, the Bible says, \"David broke a lamb's leg to protect it from wandering off. \" I have to tend to my flock any way I can.    Drugs?   Yeah.  I knew when he missed his shift, he was just holed up in his house, getting high.  The good shepherd.  Yeah, when I have to be.  It's open.    The clicker.    Oh, right.  I got it All wrong.  Is this what the power of belief is all about? Knowing a dead fruit vendor never strayed, tending to a lost member of your flock, the ability to change?   What is it?   Nothing good.  Stay back.    Where's our boy?   Safe.    Please get off the property.    Fuck you.  Is there a problem? This is you staying back? This is not your fight.  Hey, you deaf, pendejo? You should pick up your friend and leave.  We're going.  But not without our boy, Nick.  I'm not afraid of you, son.  And I damn sure ain't afraid to die.  I know what's waiting for me on the other side.  Do you? \"Mark the perfect man \"and behold the upright, for at the end of that man is peace. \" Shut up.  What you waiting for, son? He can't tell if Brother Sam is bluffing, crazy or a true believer.  Join the club.    You don't want to do that.    Faith, brother.  God is in control.  Miami Metro.  You kill him or me, you'll have the whole department after you.  Yo, Julio, let's get the fuck out of here.  This ain't over.  Well, until it is, I'm praying for you, son.  Well, you best be praying I don't put you down like the last fuck up that crossed me.  Remember Hector Nunez? They never found his body, did they?   That was   That was a miracle.  Miami Metro? Forensics department.  Lab geek.  They didn't need to know that.  You don't fight like no lab geek.  Lord have mercy.  It's just an evening full of wonders tonight, huh? Praise God.  The Lord works in mysterious ways.  You don't say.  Where were you last night? My sister's.  She was worried about me.  I couldn't get away.  You know that she can't be saved, right? She is a good person.  She's all that I have.  You know that isn't true.  You have me and you have God now.  But I see you have to be reminded of that.  Is this what you want, Travis? To hurt me? You see how I suffer for your sins? Stop! I won't see her again.  I won't.  I swear.  It's my job to take care of you.    Not hers.    Forgive me.  I will do better.  I will show you that I'm worthy.  Oh, fuck me.  Hey.  So You shouldn't have.  Really.  You know, I figured if, you know, we're gonna talk, then why not over Chinese from that place you like?   Beer's in the   I can't marry you.   fridge.    I'm sorry.  You're so good to me, but I can't.  Well, if you don't want to be with me, then why are you with me? Because it wasn't this.  I'm sorry for wanting to be an adult here, Deb, but I never meant to hurt you.  Or lead you on.  I just like things the way they are.  Yeah.  That's not good enough, you know? I want more.  That's the problem.  I don't.    You are a great   You know what? Just don't.  Don't be here when I get back, all right? And I'm your new boss.    Did you tell the little guy a story?   Jamie put him to bed.  Looks like Brother Sam's a changed man after all.  He was true to his word about being a good shepherd.  He put his own life on the line to save that kid from a pack of wolves.  And here's the leader of the pack.  Harrison eventually is going to need a good shepherd, too.  I'll be there for him.  And what about him? I was set on proving Brother Sam still deserves to be on my table, but miraculously, Julio goes and vets himself to take his place.  Hector Nunez was a barber in Julio's neighbourhood.  Went missing six months ago.  No body.  The Almighty at work? I'm not ready to call Julio a sign from God, but I am thankful for the bounty I am about to receive.  I have any clean shirts? Your room.  Or former room.    Deb being here is temporary.    Who doesn't rinse out their bowl? Temporary, I promise.  Deb.  I need a shirt.  What do you think? Dad would be proud.  Thanks again for letting me crash here until I find a place.  It's why I don't suck, remember? Just help Jamie out when you can.  Am I making the biggest mistake of my life? I don't know, Deb.  As Harrison gets older, I've been thinking more about what I believe in.  I'm coming to find the list is kind of short.  What do any of us really believe in? That you'll be a great lieutenant.  Screw Dad.  I'm gonna make you proud of me.  Dissected all seven baby snakes.  Stomachs were empty.  They didn't come from a pet store.  Most likely the wild.  Back to square one.  Remember Barry Manilow tickets.  Toxicology's back.    On what? The board is clear.    The snakes.  I hope you don't mind, but I ran tissue samples.  Which I would have done.  And look.  Heavy metals.  If there was nothing in the bellies of the snakes, where did it come from? From Mama snake, who had to have been living in a toxic environment to pass it on to her young.  You wanna look up EPA clean up sites or should I? I'd rather look up your I mean, I didn't I wasn't   Please don't sue.    You like to watch.  Good to know.  What the hell do you think you're doing? Morgan as lieutenant? Yes.  I was just sending over the paperwork.  Fuck you, Tom.  You get one of those as captain, but don't push your luck, Maria.  We agreed   the new lieutenant would be Batista.    I agreed to nothing.  And need I remind you that all personnel decisions are ultimately my decision.  If they weren't, your little plan to blackmail me wouldn't have worked.  This is gonna be a fucking disaster   and I won't take the fall for it.    Well, we'll see, won't we?   Better hurry.  Don't want to be late.    For what? Your first official task, Captain.  The Everglades? All 4,000 square miles of it? That's your big break? I never said the Everglades.  I said hazardous waste sites near or around the Everglades.  It would explain where the pollutants in the snakes came from.  Yeah.  We narrowed this down.  Someone could have seen the bad guys coming or going.    I suppose it's a start.    What gives with all the reporters? We're getting a new lieutenant.  What the fuck did you say to Deb? Good morning to you, too.  You know, everything was fine, until she spent the night at your place.  You know, she's made her choice, but it's not you or me.  Press conference is starting.  Everyone, thank you for coming on such short notice.  You're here today, because it's my privilege to introduce an officer who while under my watch, has proven herself to be one of Miami's finest and a true friend.  Ladies and gentlemen, I give you the youngest officer ever to make lieutenant in the history of Miami Metro Homicide, Debra Morgan.  I gotta hand it to you, Julio.  You ran quite a racket.  I read all about how you were shaking down local business owners like Hector Nunez.  You.    You recognise this shop, don't you?   Fuck you.  My boys will fucking kill you for this.  Let me guess.  With your history of violence, Hector stood up to you and your gang and that's why they never found his body.  Just the way they'll never find yours.  Yeah, I killed him.  So what? You're a dead man.  My boys will Will miss you, I'm sure.  So I'll make this quick.  I have to get home.  I have a much more important ritual to tend to.  You must be thinking \"Why me? \" right about now.  I can't explain it myself.  God.  The universe.  Irony.  Brother Sam wasn't who I thought he was, but you This I know all too well.  Always the same ending.  Because monsters don't get to live happily ever after.  Hands up and Good job.  The good thing about the mind of a two year old, it's easily distracted.  You want to roll it? He won't remember Daddy's box if he has one of his own.  Monster story, Daddy.  How about a new story? \"Once upon a time, there were three little pigs.  \"The first little pig built a house of straw.  \"The second, a house of sticks.  \"And the third, a house of bricks.  \"But along came the big, bad wolf. \" Wolves come in many forms.  Some have big eyes, the better to see you with.  You want to connect this part.  That's the joiner.  Others huff and puff   Hey, you all right?   No.  while others hide in plain sight.    I think I sprained my ankle.    Really?   Let's take a look at it.    I heard something snap.    Did you fall down or something?   Yeah.  I should know, because like it or not, I'm one, too.  That's never going to change.  And neither is the fact my little lamb is becoming a little boy.  Walking.  Talking.  Listening.  As much as I want Harrison to stay this way forever, from now on, the only wolves in his life have to be the stuff of fairy tales.  I can no longer allow him to see the real me.  Only the version that's make believe.  It's the only way this story gets to have a happy ending.      Previous EpisodeNext Episode"

It's why I'm making you Homicide's new lieutenant.  Fuckballs, you're serious.  I couldn't be happier.  It's about time a real cop had that job.  How come if Matthews hates you, I'm always the one paying the price? I can't tell if I'm seeing a man who's changed for the better or just a better cover.  So that darkness inside is gone?

OK, buddy.  Be good to Jamie today.  And no Fruit Roll Ups.  They make you fart.  Don't we know.  Good luck today.  You're gonna be great.  Thanks.  Why are you doing this to me? Please, just let me go.  You're not going anywhere until you've repented for your sins.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry for everything.  Not to me.  To God.  Beg forgiveness, Nathan.  If you're sincere, all of this will end.  If not, it will get much worse.  But I am sincere.  Please don't Wait.  A full 800 RPMs over the red line.  In high school, that was my dream car.  Didn't Smokey drive one of those? Or was it the Bandit? Burt Reynolds.  Yo, guys! Body's down here.  Any idea who she is? From her tight mini and a 24 pack of Trojans in her pocket, I'd say she's a working girl.  No driver's licence? Haven't found a purse or an ID.  We need to roll her over.  Easy.  Guess she lost her gym membership.    Where the hell's Quinn?   He's on his way.  Multiple blunt force trauma or manual strangulation.  Take your pick.  Are you crazy? OK, OK.  I'm late.  I'm sorry.  Not that.  The girl.  What are you doing, man? What about Deb? Deb and I broke up.  You broke up? Yeah, three days ago.  We're over.  I'm sorry.  I didn't know that.  What happened? Lieutenant Morgan happened.  She ditched you because she got promoted?   That doesn't sound like Deb.    Yeah? Cos this is the same Deb that stole your job.  She didn't steal my job.  It was never mine to start with.  That's always been your problem.  You're too nice.  You let these fucking people walk all over you.  That's bullshit.  Keep telling yourself that, Mrs LaGuerta.  You're lucky we got work to do.    What's so interesting?   Tooth is chipped.  No surprise there.  She really got worked over.  It's probably from the beating.  Or someone tried to rip it out.  You'll be leading your first briefing soon, so make sure you scan all the field reports.  It's next on my list.  I just wanna finish going through these r\u00e9sum\u00e9s.  R\u00e9sum\u00e9s? I need to pick a new detective to take my place.  I can't afford to be down a man right now.  Well, I can help you with that.  Let's see here Sam Harmon from Narcotics.  He's a real up and comer, and the fact that his father's a district judge could come in handy.  Yeah, I know Sam.  He's a solid cop.  Great.  Happy to help.  There are a lot of other names on this list.  You know, there's this guy from Chicago Forget him.  With everything on your plate right now, the last thing you want to worry about is a transfer situation, trust me.  Harmon's your guy.  Do you want me to start the paperwork? No.  I've got it.  Go ahead.  Morgan.  Don't let her shove something down your throat, not unless you're ready for seconds or thirds.  Take it from Mrs LaGuerta.  Got it.  Thanks.  Deb, one of the most important things about this job is knowing how to marshal your resources.  Take the help when it's offered.  Remember, we're in this together.  I remember when I found that under your bed.  I would have rather it had been a stack of Playboys.  Most kids in the eighth grade were obsessed with their favourite baseball players.  You tracked serial killers.  Only certain ones.  The Tooth Fairy was smart and arrogant.  They never caught him, even when he left a body on a deputy sheriff's lawn.  Fifteen women, prostitutes, all dumped on the roadside, all missing their lateral incisors.  You really think there's a connection to the victim from this morning? Her lateral incisor was cracked like someone tried to rip it out with pliers.  There was damage to her gums.  Probably a result of the beating, like Masuka said.  Maybe someone was trying to relive old times? The Tooth Fairy killings were in the '80s, Dexter.  He'd be 70 years old at least.  What would he be doing in Miami? Why do most 70 year olds come to Miami? They say old age is like a second childhood.  There are primary colours, tricycles and ball chasing.  I barely made it through my first childhood.  I guess no one makes it through the second.  This place is one block from where the victim was found.  A short walk for a retiree on a mission.    Can I help you?   I hope so.  I'm thinking about moving my dad down here.  He's 81, but still sprightly.  Bless his heart.  Coral Island's a great facility.  I'm happy to answer any questions you have.  Do you have any other residents here from Oregon? My dad's kind of shy and it'd be nice to have people around with something in common, besides hearing loss.  Let's see.  We have three residents from Oregon.  Fine people.  I'm sure your dad will get along with them famously.  That's good to hear.  Here are some brochures with everything you need to know about Coral Island.  There's some forms to fill out in case you're interested in having your dad join us.  Thanks.  I hate to trouble you, but that coffee really looks good.  I was gonna get some earlier.  I feel a caffeine headache coming on.  I know what that's like.  I'll fetch you a mug.    Be right back.    I appreciate it.  One woman, another in a wheelchair.  That leaves Moved here from Grants Pass, Oregon, five years ago.  How are you spending your second childhood? What's that? You've been doing such a good job, I put together a little surprise for your viewing pleasure.  Is this what I think it is? Evidence from the Ice Truck Killer investigation.  You said in class how you were really into this case.  Are you kidding? I was obsessed with this case.  I have followed it night and day.  This is really sweet.  This is the Ice Truck Killer's hospital ID.  And the holy of holies.  You know, when the details of this case were made public, I painted my nails like this for a whole week.  Is that just wrong? Is it wrong that it makes me hot? What do they do with all this stuff? It just sits here in evidence, forever.  That's a shame.  I mean, this is a piece of history.  It's time for the briefing.  There you are.  I've sat through God knows how many briefings.  Why am I so fucking nervous? Because everyone will be looking to see if you know what you're doing.  Do me a favour.  When you get back to your desk, look up the word \"rhetorical\".  You'll be fine, Deb.  OK, everyone, we've got a lot to cover, so let's get started.  First up is the homicide on Euclid.  Where are we on identifying the victim? Her fingerprints gave us a name: Rosalia Davolos.  Several priors for solicitation.  We talked to the local merchants.  Seems that strip was practically her office.  Did we run her cell phone? It turned up a long list of numbers, mostly johns.  We're working through the names now.  What about a tox screen? Trace amounts of cocaine in her system and doughnuts.  Let's check the area for known pushers.  Maybe she got caught up in a bad deal or she got behind on a payment.  I'm hoping five or six people will volunteer They'll never tie this to a quarter century old serial killer case from Oregon.  Not sure I have either, but I can dream.  That takes us to the snakes killing.  It's looking like this wasn't a drug cartel hit after all.  As much as I hate to admit it, maybe Brother Sam was right about our victim.  Maybe he'd cleaned up his act.  That doesn't mean there wasn't someone out there looking to settle an old score.  What if we made some of the details of the case public, like the snakes? Might scare up a lead.  No.  That may compromise the case when it goes to court.  If we don't catch anyone, this will never go to court.  I think Detective Quinn has a point.  We let word out about the snakes, the press will eat it up.  Who knows? Maybe something will shake loose.    What about the trial?   Quinn's right.  There'll never be a trial unless we get someone into custody.  I think it's worth a try.  Angel, get started on the statement.  Have it on my desk by this afternoon.  I don't think you really believe what you are saying, Nathan! You need to believe what you are saying! I do.  I swear.  I don't know what it is you want from me.  I want to hear you tell God that you are sorry.  OK.  OK.  Please, please, God I'm sorry for everything I've ever done.  Just forgive me.  Forgive me.  No, no.  Wait.  Wait.  Where are you going? Let me go! Let me go! He's telling you what you want to hear.  He thinks we're gonna release him.  How much longer do we have to make him suffer? You really have a good heart, Travis.  That's why I picked you.  But there's much more at stake here than one man's suffering.  Don't we have to be strong? He has to be pure or we can't proceed.  Yes.  He's coming around.  It just takes time.  Good morning, Walter.  Keep saying that and one day you might be right.  Sam's group is about to tee off.  You can join them.  I'm short a partner.  Dan.  Walter Kenney.  I'm a little rusty, but I'll try not to slow you down.  Just get a cart, will you? Worst mistake I ever made was moving down to this piss butt corner of the country.  How bad can it be? It's the Sunshine State.  Only sunshine around here is what they blow up your ass.  The rest is mosquitoes, humidity and people that don't speak English.  So what's a young guy like you doing around Coral Island? Or do you get off hanging out with corpses? I'm checking it out for my dad.  You want to help your dad? Take him to the end of the pier and push him off.  You'll be doing him a favour.  If I was any more in the rough, I'd need a fucking machete.  This is like being trapped in a toxic cloud that cheats.  Son of a bitch! You OK? I always scream in pain when I take a swing.  Don't just stand there.  I need to sit down.  All right.  I ruptured my back two years ago.  It hasn't been the same since.  OK, just take it easy.  Jesus fucking Christ! Listen, I'm done here.  Just drop me off at the club bar.  I need something to kill the pain.  You got it.  So what'd you used to do up in Oregon? I was a pipe fitter for 25 years.  Shit job, but I managed to work up a pension.  All I want to do now is play golf.  Maybe you should find something else to pass the time.  I tell you, it's hell not being able to do what you love.  Is he talking about golf or his failure to rip out Rosalia Davolos' tooth? Walter Kenney may be the world's oldest asshole, but that doesn't make him a killer.  On the other hand, maybe I gave up too soon.  He wears a dental implant for the lateral incisor.  The same one the Tooth Fairy pulled from his victims.  Excuse me.  Hello? This is Sam from Good Shepherd Auto.  I was just calling to let you know your car's ready.  Great.  When can I pick it up? If you get here before 6:00, you won't have to fight the dog off this time.    I'm on my way.    OK.  This is on me.  I got to go pick up my car.  You know, I've got a shitload of errands to run tomorrow and with my back the way it is, I'm gonna have a real hard time on the bus.  You wouldn't want to give me a ride, would you? Perfect, now I won't have to make an excuse to run into you again.  I'm in 72.  Pick me up at 9:00.  Actually, I'd rather have my teeth pulled.  Happy to do it.  People don't put no oil in it and then wonder why they Hey! Hey, man, yeah.  She's right down here.  I'll be right back, Nick.  God bless him.  Nick has been busting his ass, man.  He's off the drugs.  Cut his ties with the gang, man.  I really think he wants to change.  You must be relieved.  I'm proud of him is what I am, man.  It's not easy turning your life around, man.  It could go south at any minute, but I'll take the blessings as they come.  This looks like the day I bought it.  You do good work.  It's all these repair jobs that pay for that good work.  Listen.  You got any plans this Sunday? Like service? What would I be getting serviced? Like a church service.  No.  Not much of a churchgoer.  Yeah, I figured that.  Well, we having something like a company get together, like a beach party.  It'd be great if you could come.  This Sunday's tough.  I don't have a sitter for Harrison.  That's your boy? Yep.  He's two.  Yeah? Bring him along.  It's a kid friendly environment.  He'll love it.  Play some ball, put the grill on, have a little beach barbecue baptism.    Baptism?   Yeah.  Nick.  He's taking the big leap, praise God.  He's taking the Holy Spirit on right there in the waters of the Biscayne Bay.  Sounds like you're trying to get me to go to church.  So what? What? You afraid you gonna catch something? I'm just not sure I fit in.  Sure you do.  Listen.  I just think it'd be great for you to take a stand with someone whose life that you helped turn around.  And if you do happen to find God, a lot worse ways you could spend your day off.  Only one mention of Walter Kenney in the criminal database, and he's identified as a victim.  Walter Kenney's mother, charged with felony child abuse against her son.  I have to vent, or my head's gonna explode.    What's wrong?   Everything.  I'm my ex boyfriend's boss.  I don't know how to act.  I don't know what to do.  I don't know who to hire.  I have a stack of paperwork on my desk that's taller than I am.  Take a breath, sit down.  I think I really fucked up taking this promotion.  I was a fucking great detective who loved her fucking job.  I traded it all in for politics and paperwork and LaGuerta up my ass.  Deb, you're too smart to think that this was gonna be easy.  Well, I didn't expect this.  I didn't expect people sitting around waiting for me to fall on my face.  No one wants you to fail.  OK, LaGuerta probably wouldn't lose any sleep if you stumbled a bit.  She'd pop a bottle of champagne.  But guess what.  You're new at the job.  You're gonna stumble.  You think LaGuerta never messed up? Shit, yeah.  Cut yourself some slack.  You've been Lieutenant one day.  If a couple months go by, you still hate it, you can demote yourself, but until then, just go with your gut.  And when you screw up, just don't take me down with you.  I need the paycheck.  OK.  My panic needle's swinging out of the red.  Good.  How are you with the Quinn of it? I miss being with him.  Really? Quinn's a good guy.  We had fun together.  It was easy.  No expectations.  That's one decision I know I made right.  Quinn and I were never meant to get serious.  I have to go.  I have to put people on the snakes killing.  Thank you for talking me off the ledge.  You're the best.  Is it a good time for me to ask for a raise?   Terrible.    I'm serious.  Fuck off and die.  Maybe she shouldn't have taken the promotion.  She might not be cut out for it.  I think there's very little Deb's not cut out for.  Kenney's mother was taken into custody for repeatedly hitting her son in the face in public.  I'm not seeing the connection.  Maybe that's how he lost his tooth.  So Walter Kenney has mother issues.  Sounds familiar.  Doesn't mean that he is the Tooth Fairy.  But it's another reason for me to spend my day off with Mr Sunshine.  You said 9:00.  I just need a couple of seconds.  TV, Barcalounger and a view of the parking lot.  This wasn't on the Coral Island brochure.  My son.  Gave him everything in life, and now I can't get him on the phone.  You have kids? You're lucky.  Ungrateful little pricks.  They suck the life out of you, and then they vanish.  Where are my fucking house keys? He's completely alone.  Alienated everyone around him.  Here they are.  I'm losing my fucking mind.  Abrams in 23.  Dumb as a bag of dog shit.  Looks like a space just opened up for your dad.  Shit.  Here's my prescription.  Just pick it up for me, will you? Sure.  Hey, hey, hey! And a six pack of beer from the liquor store and the latest Teen Ass, Nipple Parade and Spanked.  Teen Ass, Nipple Parade and Spanked.  Can this really be the man who inspired me to keep a scrapbook? Can I get Teen Ass, Nipple Parade, and Spanked? Some needs just don't go away.  Even if the equipment is on life support.  Does that hold true for killing? Just one last stop, and then I'm out of your hair.  I'll take the bus home from here.  What about your back? Got my remedy.  See you.  What wrong turns do you take to lead to this at the end of your life? An 8 by 12 storage shed, a six pack of beer and a stack of porno mags.  I need those rundowns on the interviews you did with the victim's johns.  Yeah, I'm still working on them.  Anything I should know? They're all sketchy characters, but their alibis check out.  Final forensics report on the snakes killing.  Nothing new, but if you notice the grammar's improved, it's because Ryan typed it up.  So, Ryan, right? You've been here a week now.  How you liking it?   It's heaven.    Yeah?   Even with Vince around?   Good one.  I love homicide.  I've always been fascinated by people who do bad things.  Maybe that's cos you got a little bad in you.  You think? I think you got a lot of bad in you.  You may be right.  Yeah.  But you'll never know.  Can I talk to you for a second? We're still interviewing Rosalia's johns.    So far, nothing.    Not about the case.  I want to know how you're doing with the whole situation.  Right.  I'm good.  Matter of fact, I just got done packing up your stuff.  You didn't have to do that.  You know, I figured you're busy with your new job and all.  You know, might not have time.  Kind of wanted it out of the house.  So if you want to pick it up, it's in the garage right next to the big bag of fertiliser.  Quinn, I know you're pissed.  You're doing a great job of letting me know that.  But this wasn't easy on me either.  I'm sure.  You know, from what I hear, that promotion just came out of the blue.  You think that my becoming Lieutenant had anything to do with what happened between us? No, I'm sure it was just a big fucking coincidence.  Quinn, that is so fucking unfair.  There seems to be a lot of that going around.  I got my share.  Maybe you're getting yours.  Don't hurt me.  You have to make a choice, Nathan.  Are you going to be saved?   It's up to you.    Yes, please! Please.  Dear God, cleanse me of all my sins.  Forgive me for all the evil that I've done.  Forgive me, please.  Forgive me.  Forgive me.  Forgive me.  Forgive me.  He's ready.  Two hours in that storage facility.  I'm guessing he wasn't organising his Penthouse collection.  It's like my box of slides.  Dried blood on the roots.  These are from all of his victims.  He's the Tooth Fairy.  The man who terrorised the Pacific Northwest for 20 years.  All he has left is a box of teeth.  Is this what happens to serial killers at the end of their lives? Everything's ready.  Kenney's apartment will make the perfect kill room.  No one ever visits him and the maid won't show up until the morning.  Tonight, Walter Kenney will have his final tee off.    Hello?   It's Walter.  I'm really fucked! What is it? I got off at the wrong stop, and now I don't know where the hell I am.  I've been riding around for hours.  Fucking hell! OK, OK.  Just calm down.  I'll swing by and pick you up.  What's the street name and number of the bus stop? Got it.  Just stay where you are.  I'll be there in 10 minutes.  He made it easy for me to vet him.  Now he's making it easy for me to kill him.  Kenney's a monster, but at least he's considerate.  I don't know what the fuck's wrong with me.  Sometimes I get so confused.  Yeah, don't worry about it.  I'm just glad I was in the neighbourhood.  I don't know what I would have done if you hadn't answered.  You're a good kid.  As if I wasn't starting to feel enough pity for him, now he's throwing gratitude at me? Keep your eye on the road or I'll blow your head out the window.  Drive until I tell you to turn.  How did you get on to me? I don't know what you're talking about.  You're Miami Metro, Dexter.  I checked your car registration when you were filling my prescription, and then I \"goggled\" your name.  Yeah, that's right, dickwad.  Maybe I haven't taken a decent shit in 10 years, but I'm not fucking stupid.  Turn right at the next light.  Where are we going? To settle our business.  You're gonna tell me how you figured out who I am.  And then you're gonna kill me? You haven't left me much choice, have you? Left into the next parking lot.  OK.  And just for kicks, I might rip out all your teeth before I shoot you.  What the fuck are you Those are ready for cataloguing.  Hey, after work tonight, you want to grab some pho? Grab some what? It's Vietnamese food.  It's basically a large bowl of noodles.  And broth.  So you're asking me out? As in a date? You don't have to call it that if you don't want to.  I want to.  So that's a yes? Yeah.  Wow.  What? It's just that I ran the conversation through my mind a bunch of times.  It always ended in rejection and bodily harm.  You should be more confident.  You know, in the right light, you're actually kind of cute.  I'm about to interview my top pick for the detective slot.  I thought you might want to sit in.  No point.  Sam Harmon and I go way back.    Harmon's not my top choice.    He's not? It's Mike Anderson, the transfer from Chicago.  He's got 10 years on homicide, a ridiculous solve rate, recommendations coming out of his ass.  We'd be lucky to have him.  I really put a lot of thought into this.  If that's true, then I'm seriously worried about your judgement, because this is a huge mistake.  I don't think it is.  Look, I know I'm new at this job.  And it's not that I don't value your advice, but sometimes I have to trust my gut, and right now my gut is telling me Mike Anderson.  It's your decision, Lieutenant.  You can do whatever the hell you want.  But understand this: You're on your own.  If this doesn't work out, don't look to me to have your back.  Mike Anderson.  I'm here to see the lieutenant.  That's me.  It's great to meet you.  Debra Morgan.    What's funny?   You, the lieutenant.    That a problem?   Listen.  I just got off a three hour flight and I'm really tired, which means I'm not in the mood for any cute department razzing.  So will you take me to your boss, please? Maybe score me some coffee on the way, no cream.  You listen.  Right now, you're my top choice for this job, but that can change real fucking fast.  I put my ass on the line even considering you, so stow the attitude or the only job you're gonna find in this city is guarding a landfill as a rent a cop.  Look, I apologise.  I didn't mean any disrespect.  It's just the other lieutenants I've served under had Dicks? Been around the block.  Trust me.  This is just as weird for me as it is for you.  Moving on.  Let's talk.  You know, I just got my car out of the shop.  What the hell is this? This is the end, Walter.  You pulled your last tooth.  How did I get here? Service entrance.  I think I tweaked my back.  Fuck me.  You could have spent your final days relaxing, enjoying life, but then there was Rosalia Davolos.  She's the first one in 10 years.  Wasn't she? Why now? I got tired of staring at a box of teeth.  Took me 10 minutes to kill the whore.  Lost another 20 trying to pull the goddamn tooth.  You know, when I was in high school, it seemed you were all the country was talking about.  The Tooth Fairy.  Too clever for the police.  They couldn't catch you.  Like Burt Reynolds with his Trans Am.  I still can't believe you are the same man that dumped a body at a deputy sheriff's house.  Total fucking accident.  I downed a few too many and didn't feel like driving out to the highway to get rid of the bitch.  That's disappointing.  Well, I'm very fucking sorry to let you down.  Does that mean you don't want my autograph? No.  Just this.  I took teeth.  You take blood.  You're the same kind of sick fuck, aren't you? At least I'm never gonna end up like you.  Yeah? When you can't do this any more, what do you have then? More.  You're kidding yourself, asshole.  All I ever cared about was killing, and I can't even do that right any more.  That's what you've got to look forward to.  This is your future, and it includes adult fucking diapers! You are not my future.  I will not spend my final days getting drunk and staring at a box of trophies.  Keep telling yourself that.  Make sure they know who I am.  I wish I could see the look on my son's face when he finds out.  He won't be able to ignore that! I'd never want my son to know who I was.  You said you didn't have a kid.  I also said my name was Dan.  What are you doing? You're not gonna die as the Tooth Fairy.  You're gonna die as a sad old man of a heart attack.  No! The latest resident to check out of the Coral Island Retirement Village.  Walter Kenney's son will never know his father was a monster.  Or at least not a killer.  We all want life to have some kind of meaning.  Seems like the older we get, the harder we look for it and the harder it is to find.  And some of us just look in the wrong place.  But if our lives don't have meaning Horsey, Daddy.  what can we leave behind for those we care about? There you go, buddy.  Walter Kenney wanted to pass on the ugliness that his life had become.  What will I pass on? I don't know which slide goes where, who's who.  There's no order any more.      Previous EpisodeNext Episode"

        "script": "Previously on Dexter That takes us to the snakes killing.  Maybe Brother Sam was right about our victim.  Is this what I think it is? Evidence from the Ice Truck Killer investigation.  You think that my becoming Lieutenant had anything to do with what happened between us? No, I'm sure it was just a big fucking coincidence.  I don't know how to act.  I don't know what to do.  I don't know who to hire.  Deb, you're too smart to think that this was gonna be easy.  I put my ass on the line even considering you, so stow the attitude.  Are you going to be saved?   It's up to you.    Yes, please! Dear God, cleanse me of all my sins.  He's ready.  Do you undertake to keep God's commandments and the faith of his son, our Lord? I do.  Some people think that religion began as a way for primitive cultures to explain natural phenomenon, the fire, the wind, the rain.  They created a God for each one.  I baptise you, my brother, in Christ.  You are baptised with Christ in death.  You'd think science would have made religion obsolete.  But it hasn't.  Go for a swim, come out a new man.  If only I believed it were that simple.  But Brother Sam believes, and because of that, he's fulfilled.  It's written all over his face.  That's my son, Harrison.  Can you say hi? Guess not.  It's all right.  Did you see Nick? He wanted to thank you for coming by.  Yeah, he can thank me tomorrow at the shop when I bring my car in.  What? You had another accident? Bad driving karma.  Man, somebody trying to tell you to slow down, brother.  So what'd you think? It was interesting.  Don't get me wrong.  The spiritual stuff, the second chances, I think it's great.  For Nick.  But not for you, huh? I get it.  You take a dunk in the bay, you fix all your problems.  It probably sounds like bullshit to you.  That's one word for it.  But, you know, it's not about the dunk.  It's about, surrender to something greater than yourself.    I don't get it.    Man, just look around.  You think you make the sun come up in the morning? You think you can make the tide come in? No, but that's the Earth rotating on its axis, the pull of the moon.  So you do believe in something greater than yourself.    Got to go.  Work.    OK.  Harrison, get the car.  Yeah, somebody got to do the driving with him.  Go ahead.  Jesus Christ! What's with the wicked rodeo? Your guess is as good as mine.  Some sick fuck sewed body parts to mannequins and then strapped them to horses.  I mean, what the fuck? Body parts? This spectacle makes me think of Brian, my brother.  Your brother?   Rudy, the Ice Truck Killer?   Sorry.  No, it's OK.  I was thinking it, too.  Just the idea that someone would put this much   Imagination.   brutality into killing.  Come here.  I want to show you something.    Lieutenant.    Hold on a sec.  Check it out.    Lieutenant.    I'm in the middle of something.  Remember this? It's the same insignia that was carved into the stomach of the snakes victim.  Looks like a signature.  Same sick fuck.  Two different killings.  Hey, Lieutenant? For the love of God, what? Right.  One at a time.  Go.  Been calling around the local stables.  There's one about a mile north from here, reported four horses missing two days ago.    Quinn?   Mounted patrol's on the way.  They'll be here within the hour.  I've been counting the body parts and typing the blood, and it's all B positive.  So I think we're looking at one victim here.  Jesus.  Somebody went to a lot of trouble.  He's trying to tell us something.  Yeah.  \"I'm a crazy piece of shit. \" He's saying, \"It's the end of the world. \" Something like that.  Four horsemen of the Apocalypse, white, red, pale, and black.  Doesn't take a genius to figure it out.  And who are you? I'm sorry.  This is Mike Anderson from Chicago.  He's my replacement.  Mike, this is everyone.  You were saying? The killer's showing us a scene from the Book of Revelation.  A killer with faith?   Damn, it's hot out here.    Yeah.  It's Miami, genius.    What about snakes?   What about them? Seven snakes.  Any mention of them in the Book of Revelation?   Don't know.  I'll look into it.    Do that.  In the meantime, you two, go to the stable.  See if a surveillance tape will give us a suspect.  Dexter, Masuka, take shots of the horses so we can start taking this shit apart.  Whoever did this seems to be a member of my tribe.  But this is a horse of a different colour.  What is this? Masuka confirmed that the body parts all belong to the same victim.  We got an ID off the fingerprints, Nathan Roberts.  Went for a jog a couple of days ago, never came back.  Did you compare the kill wound against the snakes victim?   I did.    And? It's a perfect match.  Same signature, same kill wound.  Same killer.  The ME's report said there was residue in the wound.  It's being processed.  We should have it back at the lab later today.  Any ideas for a murder weapon? Some kind of stabbing implement.  Won't know for sure until we get the ME's measurements of the wound.  What about the cuts on the body? I'm guessing a bone saw.  What do we have here?   What is it?   I don't know.    Some kind of message.    Another one? Jesus! How much does this fucker have to say? A lot, apparently.  Want to bet he left one on the snakes victim, too? Nothing behind his eyes.  What about the mouth or the ears? Already checked.  What are we missing? We're not.  It's what he's missing.  His intestines.  Kind of reminds me of looking for the prize in a cereal box.  You were always good at that, too.  Jackpot! What do you think it means? That I've been lieutenant for less than a week and there's already some game playing, sick as fuck serial killer for me to catch? Technically, he's not a serial killer.  Yet.  Serial killing involves the murder of several people in three or more separate events.  So far our guy's only done two.  Are you trying to make me feel better or worse? Sorry.  It's Jamie.  Hey, everything OK? Harrison isn't feeling so great.    What happened?   I don't know.  He didn't He didn't eat breakfast.  But, I mean, he seems OK otherwise.  Just a little tired.  I don't know.  Maybe it's a tummy ache, or Should I cancel his play date? Yeah, absolutely.  It's better to be safe than sorry.    OK.    If he gets any worse I'll call you.  I promise.  You wanted to see me? Yeah, this four horsemen case, it's all over the news.  We need to address the press.  Already two steps ahead of you.  I called a conference for this afternoon,   and I'm working on a statement.    Morgan's gonna make the statement.  But she doesn't have any experience.  I've led hundreds of press conferences, and, really, under the circumstances Morgan is the new face of this department, Maria.    I'm still   The old face.  Now, set it up for tomorrow afternoon.  Fine.  Why the fuck would I lead a press conference?   Isn't that your thing?   Usually, yes.  But I made a strategic decision to put you in the spotlight.  You'll give the public the impression that the situation's less critical.  Besides, dealing with the press is your responsibility as lieutenant.  I thought my responsibility was catching the horse fucker that's killing people.  You'll have to learn to multitask.  And while you're at it, you still haven't finished your fit for duty therapy.  The shooting was over two weeks ago.  How am I supposed to find time to go to a therapist? Figure it out.  You're a liability until you get cleared.  Fucking nightmare.  You OK? Obviously.  You'll be fine.  Just Never mind.  Not my place.  What? Tell me.  You just mightwant to dress a little more professional.  Like a lieutenant.  I mean, you know, skirt suit, heels.  What's wrong with the way I dress? I mean, you kind of look like you're What? A detective? No, like you're going to a hoedown.  Where should I put the medical examiner's report   for the four horsemen's case?   Wherever.  You busy later? Thought we could have our second date.  Sure, I have roller derby practise until 9:00, but we can totally hang after.  Wait, wait, wait.  You're a You're a derby girl? Got the bruises to prove it.  I think my head just exploded.  I have an idea.  Why don't we have our second date right now? What are you thinking? Little make out session in the women's bathroom? I was thinking some show and tell in the evidence room? Even better.  Not the dirty kind.  You know, showing me the Ice Truck Killer stuff was so cool.  I was just thinking maybe you could show me the Trinity stuff   or the Bay Harbour Butcher evidence.    I can't.  FBI has all those files But I promise to make it up to you later.  You better.  Now open the ME's report.  I'm dying to know what it says.  When Brian sent messages, they were tailor made for me.  But I should still be able to crack this guy's code.    All right.    Ready? Let's do this.  Most of you have already met Detective Mike Anderson.  He's working on a theory that our killer is re enacting scenes from the Book of Revelation.  There's a lot of brutal imagery here, and our killer had a lot to choose from.  I just got the ME report from the four horsemen vic.    Guess what it says.    Must be pretty important for you to bust in here like this.  He's a little bit of a drama queen.  There were traces of oxidised iron in the kill wound.  Rust.  I mean, nobody's used iron to make weapons since the Middle Ages.  Which means our killer could have used an ancient artefact.    What kind of artefact?   I'm not sure yet.  But the dimensions of the wound suggest a sword.  But there are hundreds of varieties of swords.  Great.  Stay on that.  Mike, you were saying? So far, our killer has given us three tableaus.  The intestines on the scale, the snakes victim, and the four horsemen.  I'm sorry.  \"Tableaus\"? It's a theatrical term referring to a picturesque grouping of people or objects.  All this time, I just thought they were called crime scenes.  No, it's more than just a crime scene.  Everything he's showing us has meaning, from the positioning of the bodies to the clothes he puts on his victims.    Nothing's by accident.    Exactly.  He's communicating with us.  Mike's just helping with the translation.  The four horsemen of the Apocalypse are described in Revelation 6, verses one through eight.  As for the seven snakes murder, Revelation 13.  \"And I stood upon the sand of the sea and saw a serpent rise out of the sea, \"having seven heads. \" And what about the intestines? There's no passage on intestines, but the scales of justice are all over the Bible.  I figure he's referencing God's judgement of mankind.  What about the numbers we found on the body? Don't know.  But I can get in touch with a Revelation expert who might be able to tell us more.  They happened five days apart.  The two murders, they happened five days apart.  The difference between I don't know why I didn't see it before.  So the numbers are days.  He's counting up to something.    To what?   Don't know.  But if all this Revelation stuff has to do with doomsday, maybe it's to the end of the world.  OK, so we're looking for a religious nut bag.  Quinn, Batista, round up any end times fanatics that might have criminal records.  Let's find this Doomsday Killer.  It's happening, Travis.  Look around us.  People are afraid.  Soon, you'll start to understand what we're Travis, are you listening to me? Yes.  They're afraid.  OK, I got it.  She's pretty.    Who?   The waitress.  You've been staring at her.  But we really have to stay focused.  So you don't think I should ask her out?   Is that what you want?   I don't know.  Maybe.    I think she likes me.    Hey, Trav.  Can I get you anything else?   Yeah.    Yeah? Thank you.  I thought religion was supposed to be comforting.  But swarms of locusts, bowls of wrath? Why would anybody want to believe this stuff? Be honest.  Professional or stupid? Professional.  But you don't look much like you.  You want to tell me how I'm supposed to catch Doomsday if I'm spending all my time writing press statements, going to court ordered therapy and shopping for ugly ass clothes? You'll figure it out.  You always do.  Quinn used to say that when I was in meltdown mode.  He saw you in meltdown mode and he still wanted to marry you?   Poop explosion.    Harrison? If it's Jamie, you've got bigger problems.  Keep an eye on him while I'm down in the laundry room?   His tummy still upset?   Yeah.  It's probably just a bug, but I can take him to the doctor tomorrow.  Hey, what's the matter, little man? You don't feel so good? Wish I could make it all better.  I guess there are some things even daddies can't fix.  So I gave you the friends and family rate.  And I can have that to you ASAP.  Thanks.  The sooner the better.  I just want to let you know I'm taking off, all right? All right.    Dex, what's up?   What's up! So you headed off to class? Hey, Sam's sending me to computer class.    Gonna build him a bomb website, yo.    Yeah, you better.    All right.  Laters.    Be safe.  See you, Nick.  You really take care of these guys.  Yeah, well, you know, God's taking care of all of us.  Here go your estimate.  Again.    Are these your notes?   Yeah.  Every time I read it, I'm finding something new.    You ever read it?   Yeah, I just started, for work.  We're tracking this killer.  We think he's re enacting scenes from the Book of Revelation.  That four horsemen case from the news, yeah? Lord have mercy.  Saying it's in the name of God, the devil is busy.  You think he's using God as an excuse to kill? People use God as an excuse for a lot of things.  Just because he believes in some crazy bullshit, that don't mean his faith is any less real.  But if faith makes people do such crazy bullshit, what's the point of having it? It's human nature.  Gotta believe in something.  Right? I mean, haven't you ever had a problem so big that you just couldn't handle it on your own?   Yeah.    Well, who helped you? My dad.  Well, you're lucky, you're blessed.  That's a blessing.  Faith, man, you put it in the wrong things it'll fuck you up.  Goddamn pantyhose.  Has anyone ever died from crotch asphyxiation? You have now crossed the line into inappropriate brother sister exchanges.  Is that Lieutenant Morgan in a skirt? I don't know.  I don't recognise her without the man boots.  You'll recognise my foot when it's kicking you in the face.    But the Mayan calendar says   The Mayans weren't Christians.  Look, God told Noah that the great flood would be in seven days.  Batista and Quinn's people of interest.  Even if none of them is Doomsday, they're all totally insane.  At 9:45 yesterday morning, four horses were released at the intersection.  Lieutenant, you ready for the press conference? Yeah.  I'm just practising my statement.  You want some honest advice? I guess.  Lose the speech.  Just relax.  Have a conversation.  You're not a formal person, so a formal statement could come off as insincere.  So you're saying I should just be myself? Exactly.  Nice shoes, by the way.    They look better on.    Yeah, well, they hurt my feet.  You know what else you could use? Nice.  See you later.  Brother Sam reads his Bible like I read blood, and every time he comes away with something new.  Maybe if I want answers about this killer, his work deserves a second look.  Such aggressive, brutal cuts.  He butchered this body.  But that doesn't make any sense.  Not when he was so meticulous about composing his crime scenes.  The complexity of the stitching in the belly of that fruit vendor.  The attention to detail, attaching plastic to flesh.  So why would this same fastidious craftsman so carelessly hack and slash? Unless it's not the same killer.  You think one person cut up the body and another composed the crime scene? Maybe we're not looking for one Doomsday Killer.  Maybe we're looking for two.  This is Vince Masuka.  Hey, I've been bounced around to, like, five people, so I'm hoping you can help me.  I can try.  What you need? I'm a collector, and there's a prosthetic hand for auction on buythistreasure. com.  Says it's from the Ice Truck Killer investigation.    Is that real?   What? No.  Hang on a sec.  No, that's It's gotta be fake.  The only people with access to our evidence room are police employees and interns.  Fuck me.  So I shouldn't bid on it, or No, definitely not.  Ryan.  Shit.  No, no, no.  What's wrong? You stole the hand from the Ice Truck Killer evidence and sold it online? You said it was just going to sit there.  The chain of custody is sacred.  I mean, did you ever stop to think what would happen   if we ever needed to go back?   I'm sorry.  I was short on rent, and I needed the money, so I Are you crazy? I mean, I could lose my job over this.  No one has to know.  Just   Let me make it up to you.    I'm such an idiot.  For thinking you were actually into me.  I was.  I am.  Get out.  We're done.  And we're live in three, two, one.  My detectives are interviewing several suspects, but we won't release a name until a suspect is officially charged.  Is it true the four horsemen case is connected to the murder of the fruit vendor, Omar Rivera? We're not here to discuss the Rivera case.  But the same alpha and omega signature was found at both crime scenes.  Isn't that right? Come on, Deb.  Don't go into meltdown mode now.  Actually, yes, we believe that's our killer's signature.  So if you see something, say something.  Call the department with any information that might help us catch this killer.  We're all in this together.  I'm not gonna lie to you about this investigation, because I don't really see the point.  I'm not into politics, and I don't care about press conferences or Or public opinion.  All I care about is catching the fucker that did this.  Shit.  That'll be all.  Lieutenant Morgan, another question.  Is it me, or does our captain look happy our lieutenant just shit the bed? It's not you.  Trust me.  I used to be married to her.  Hey, we got one more nut job to interview.  This preacher, Jeremiah Allen.  So we got to make a house call.  All right.  Let's go.  Please tell me it wasn't that bad.  It was pretty bad.  Is that LaGuerta's necklace? I seriously hate you right now.  Deb, hold on a sec.  Hello? I'll be right there.  Your son's temperature's 104.  We need to get him into surgery ASAP.    His appendix is ruptured.    What happens now? We'll do our best to make sure he's OK.  Need you to sign that parental consent.  He's gonna be OK, right? We'll do everything we can.  Hey, buddy, Daddy's gonna wait right here so the doctors take good care of you, OK?   Hello.    Hey, it's Sam from Good Shepherd.  Your car's ready.  You said you needed it ASAP, so it's here.  Yeah, can I pick it up tomorrow? I'm at Saint Peter's with my son.    Is everything OK?   He just went into surgery.    Do you need me to   I got to go.  You gave us the wrong address.  It was a sandwich shop.  The preacher, Jeremiah Allen.  He's unlisted.  Fine! Call me back.  Should have taken my car.  Got the GPS.  Just finish up your frita so we can head back to the station.  We'd already be on the way if you let me eat in the car.  No way.  You're not getting grease on Norma.  What? It was my mother's name.  Now I think I know why you're divorced.  Fucking waste of an afternoon.  You got a little, like, cilantro or something on your What the fuck? Is this yours? No.  It belonged to the kid that sold me the car.  I mean, the weed, the Trans Am.  If you're having a mid life crisis, we can talk about it.  I'm not having a mid life crisis.  What's wrong with this car?   I think it's cool.    Yeah, it's   What are you doing?   I'm making lemonade.  Put that shit away.  We're cops.  We're on duty cops.  So what? It's not like we're gonna hear back from dispatch today anyway.  I haven't smoked that shit since I was 16.  Exactly, Grandpa.  Don't you want to be cool? Give me that.  I could feel hot flames of fire roaring in my back.  Dude, quit staring at me.  You're freaking me out.  It's sad.  I can feel how much your heart hurts for Deb.  Dude.  Get your big, fucking sausage hands off me.  That's terrible.  Batista.  Got it.  Thanks.  That was dispatch.  We got Jeremiah Allen's address.  Jeremiah who? The guy.  The dude.  The The preacher.  Right! Awesome.  Where's my hat? Did you know that children who undergo anaesthesia under the age of three are more likely to develop learning disabilities? Are you doing research? And once the appendix bursts, the complication rate rises to 59%.  Maybe you should get off the internet.  You think we should call Astor and Cody, Iet them know Harrison's in surgery? No, not yet.  I don't want to worry them.  Deb, is that you on TV? Or public opinion.  All I care about is catching thethat did this.  Fuck.  Sorry.    Dexter?   Sam, what are you doing here? I figured if I had a son who was going through surgery, I'd probably want some backup, too, so  Thanks.    Brother Sam? You came in on the Omar Rivera case.  Are you guys, like, friends now?   Yeah, well, I have the auto shop.    Yep! I'm gonna go to the cafeteria, see if anything's edible.  Any takers? I'll browse.  How you holding up? Honestly, not good.  I hate not knowing if he's gonna be OK, not being able to protect him.  Sometimes you just got to surrender.  I'm sorry, man.  That probably wasn't the   It's OK.   best thing to say.  No, it's If I was in your situation, I would not want to hear that shit.  I used to not always be like this.  People used to talk to me about God, man.  Used to make me want to punch them in their face.    Really?   Yeah, yeah.  I used to believe in something else.  What? The same as you.  My dad.  Whatever, that That didn't work out.  What happened? Hey, you got enough on your mind, man.  You don't need to Want to hear no stories   about me and my dad.    No, I appreciate the distraction.  When I was growing up, my dad was a real popular guy.  Everybody knew him.  They used to call him \"Mister\".  He was always working, but I never really knew what he did.  So one day I asked him.  I said, \"Daddy, what do you do? \" He looked at me and said, \"Whatever I want, whenever I need. \" Like that.  He said he was going to see a friend of his.  So we get there.  He says, \"Go on up there and ring that doorbell for me. \" So I do it.  And this man comes to the door.  And he's staring at me, not knowing who I am or why I'm there.  And before I can turn around and say, \"I'm with Mister,\" my dad is standing right there behind me with a pistol in his hand.  And he takes his pistol and he points it at this man, and he shoots him in the face.  Killed him.  Blood everywhere.  All on my Superman shirt.  My dad just calmly picks me up, walks to the car, drives off slowly.  And he says, \"You did a good job. \" He used you.  No surprise I ended up in prison.  So what changed? Well, when I first got locked up, them first few months, I was just mad.  And I just wanted to hurt somebody, anybody.  And this new guy comes in.  And he's just loud and bragging, and, \"I was this, that in the street. \" And so I'm just looking at him.  I'm thinking to myself, \"OK, when I get a chance, I'm gonna tune this motherfucker up. \" So we get yard time, and I'm following him.  And he goes into the chapel.  I sneak up on him, and I start choking him out.  I'm trying to kill him.  And then I see this light.  Like, figuratively, or No, no, like, for real.  Like, light.  Sunlight coming through these chapel windows, and I could just see everything around me.  I could see where I was at and what I was doing, and I didn'twant to do it no more.  And you think that was God? Dexter, all I know is that when I let that man go, that I'd never felt that good about nothing in my life.    I'm gonna grab some coffee.    Yeah.  Come on.  Come on.  Just let him be OK.  Please let him be OK.  I don't know how this works, but if there's something I need to do in return, I'll do it.  OK? You're going out with that woman, aren't you? Her name is Erin.  If you like, I could cancel.  I could stay here with you.  There's more work I could do.  No, we were given free will for a reason, Travis.  You can do whatever you want.  As long as you're willing to accept the consequences God gives you.  It's just dinner.  I'll be back home by 10:00.  Good night.  And your parents, are you close? Yes, we were.  They died when I was 14.    Car wreck.    I am so sorry.  That's terrible.  My sister pretty much raised me after that.  Poor thing.  You guys are really lucky that you had each other.  I want you, Travis.  Travis.  Kid's a champ.  Made it through with flying colours.  Thank God.  I mean, thank you.  Thank you so much, Doctor.  My pleasure.  They're taking him up to recovery now.  You can see him in a few minutes.  I knew he'd be OK.  I got to go.  Matthews wants to talk to me.  Probably about the conference.  I'm totally fucked.  Long day, you should go home.  Are you sure? I can hang.  No, go.  I'll call you if anything changes.    OK.  Good night.    Good night.  Thanks for staying.  You didn't have to.  Not a problem.  I wanted to.  I'm glad little man is all right.  Yeah, me too.  I know.  Thank God.  That's just an expression.  I know.  Just, another marvel of modern science.  Yeah, you put your faith in God, I put my faith in science.  It's cool.  We don't have to believe in the same thing, but you got to keep an open mind.  You may say I can't prove that God exists, but you can't prove he doesn't.  You take care, Dex.  Deputy Chief? Morgan, did you see the news? I been getting calls about it all night.  I did, sir.  Let me just say that I am truly, deeply Everybody loves my new sparkplug of a lieutenant.    They do?   You're direct.  No bullshit.  Well, I was just trying to get the community I took a big risk when I promoted you, Morgan.  I took a lot of crap from a lot of people.  But today today you've made me very, very proud.  Your dad would have been proud, too.  Keep up the good fucking work.  Thank you, sir.  Hey.  Which one of you characters drives a Firebird? Crockett or Tubbs? You park like a dick.  You guys want to go in my office, tell me what you've been up to? Well, we'll be right in.  I've been meaning to thank you for that fashion advice.  Really upped my professional factor.  Jesus, Anderson, you have something to say, say it.  With all due respect, Lieutenant, you should probably watch the language.  Well, for your information, Matthews said people liked it.  We have a lead.  We've been speaking to this preacher, Jeremiah Allen.  Turns out he's obsessed with this Revelation expert, James Gellar.  The professor, from the University of Tallahassee? Yeah? Found this on a Google search for \"Revelation expert\".    It's all about end times.    Yeah.  Check this out.  The posts end on the day of our very first crime scene.  I can try and get in touch with him, but You can't get in touch with him, because he went underground.  Underground.  Why? Now look who's behind the curve.  I called the university.  Gellar disappeared three years ago after he got fired.    Ask me why.    Why? He got accused of stealing an ancient sword.  Like the one Masuka thinks our killer could have used in both murders? Just like that.  And get this.  This isn't just any Roman sword.  According to medieval legend, this one belonged to John the Revelator.  The guy who actually wrote Revelation.  Looks like we just found our number one person of interest.    Good job.    Thank you.  You knew this was gonna happen.  No! Please, let her go.  I like her.  You should have thought about that before you defiled her.  This is the best thing for her.  She's part of God's plan now.  Looks like your prayers were answered.    I was desperate.    Hey, no judgement.  You already talk to an imaginary father figure.    It didn't mean anything.    Are you sure? Harrison's OK, and you did make that pact.  Come on.  You don't really think there's someone out there   holding my IOU.    I don't know.  But if there is, you'd better be ready to pay the piper.  Hey.  Hey.  How's Harrison? He's fine.  He's sleeping.  Are you sure? Cos I wouldn't want to bother you.  Deb, just tell me what's up.  Got a call to a crime scene in Coral Gables.  A gardener at the botanical gardens found an alpha and an omega outside the greenhouse.    You think it's Doomsday?   Could be.  And we might have a suspect, a middle aged professor.    I'm not sure if I should leave.    Dexter.  Sorry.  I didn't mean to interrupt or anything, but if that's work, you should go.    But Harrison   Harrison is sound asleep.  Between the painkillers and the sedatives they gave him, you can probably get there and back before he even wakes up.  Dex, at the risk of sounding like the world's worst aunt, I could really use you on this.  There's blood.  I'll be there.  Call me the minute he wakes up.  I will.  I was drawn to science out of curiosity.  Any questions I had, the answers were already there.  But even science is never certain.  Even the soundest of theories is subject to new data.  And there are some things even science can't explain.  Brother Sam would say it's not an accident that I've stumbled onto a killer who seems to have his own kind of faith.  And while I don't believe in an unseen hand creating his own tableau, I do believe I don't have all the answers.    Dex, thanks for coming.    What do we got? Blood and fucking fish.  Catch of the day.  It didn't get here on its own.  So where did it come from? Dex, where are you going? Over here! Check this out.  Handle.    Holy shit.    In here! No! No! Deb, wait! Could be another trap.  Oh, God, I have to help her! Her jugular's punctured.  She's already gone.  Oh, shit, shit, shit! Kill numberthree.  It's official.  He's a serial killer.  Wait, wait, everybody.  Listen.  What the hell is that? It's coming from over here.  Locusts.  I'm not looking at Debra's middle aged professor.  Is this Doomsday number two? But that's not the look of a murderer.  That's the look of a man with true faith.  I've seen it before on Brother Sam.  Whatever this guy believes, he knows it to be true.

        "script": "Previously on Dexter So far, our killer has given us three tableaus.  The intestines on the scale, the snakes victim, and the four horsemen.  What about the numbers we found on the body? 1237 and 1242.  He's counting up to something.  Maybe it's to the end of the world.    Dexter.    Sam, what are you doing here? Brother Sam? Are you guys, like, friends now? We have a lead.  This Revelation expert, James Gellar.  The professor, from the University of Tallahassee? Looks like we just found our number one person of interest.  You're going out with that woman, aren't you? You knew this was gonna happen.  She's part of God's plan now.  Is this Doomsday number two? During the Middle Ages, it was believed that the outcome of nearly all earthly events was decided by angels, either light or dark.  I'm quite certain that face I saw in the crowd was of the dark variety.  Unfortunately, he's chosen to remain anonymous.  He left no trace DNA, no sweat, no saliva, no prints.  A small repair.  Something skin like.  Not your normal glue.  Despite his wish to remain hidden, I may find a way to yank him out of the shadows after all.  Eyes on God, not me.    And all God's people said, \"Amen\".    Amen.  Help me up.  It's time to do a little hunting.  I thought that we had some time.  You still don't hear him.  I've been fasting and praying for days, and all I can hear is the sound of my own voice banging around my head.  God remains silent to me.  It's a good thing I'm around, cos we have to find the whore of Babylon.  I was right about the glue, a polyvinyl acetate polymer dissolved in toluene.  And the backing is calfskin.  Together they're used in ancient manuscript restoration.  Dude, your sister, briefing room, now.  OK, thanks.  I'll be there in a minute.  This is no amateur.  Thank you for joining us, Dexter.  OK, everyone, let's get started.  Our victim is Erin Baer, 29.  She worked at the Glass House Caf\u00e9 at the Miami Cultural Centre.  Miami Cultural Centre, full of ancient artefacts in need of repair.  I want unis plastering Gellar's picture all over the area.  Maybe someone got eyes on him there.    I'll take lead on that.    Great.  Where are we on the Revelation aspect of this? Between the trumpet flowers placed around her, the locusts, and the iconography of an angel, our Doomsday Killer was most likely referencing Revelation, chapters 8 through 10.  Any idea why he changed it up? Why our entrance triggered her death? Normally a serial killer wants to do the kill themselves.  It's the whole point, right? There's a passage which reads, \"You must go back and report your message \"to many peoples and nations and languages and kings. \" So I'm guessing we're those people.  It seems his message is more important than the thrill.  Tell me you got something from the ME's office.  She found traces of spermicide in Erin Baer.  The ME's take is that the victim had sex with someone who used a spermicidal condom.  So what are we thinking, that she just happened to have sex before she was kidnapped? Or maybe she met Gellar, had sex with him, and things got ugly for her.  Or maybe it was Gellar's accomplice.  Can't say for sure either way.  As far as we know, she didn't know Gellar.  What did we get on Gellar's last gig? I've been trying to contact his last teacher assistant, Carissa Porter.  But so far University of Tallahassee has given us shit all.  University's not exactly thrilled to be linked to Professor Nutbag.  Let's go up there and make it clear to them that we don't give a shit whether they're thrilled or not.  I'm on it.  Lab boys, what do we have? I've got locusts.  But the necropsy on them turned up jack and shit.  All they ate was local greenery.  What about the dead fish outside the angel crime scene? All local.  You can catch them off any pier, buy them at any fish market.  But we did find another number.  This one lodged in Erin's oesophagus.  Same paper and ink as the other two.  I did a check into that number's usage in the Book of Revelation Excuse me.  Who's this? Louis Greene, the latest and greatest intern from my forensics class.  He's up to speed on the whole Doomsday case.    What happened to the blonde?   She's gone.  Go on, Louis.  Yeah, well, numerology is all over Revelation, but the only number that's repeatedly referenced that's in the thousands is 1,260.  that's what he's counting up to? If so, we've only got 15 days left.  And then what? I don't know.  End of the world, the rapture, Armageddon.  More apocalyptic bullshit.  Dex, please tell me you have something we can use.  I hate lying to my sister, but Sorry, nothing on the wings.  OK, let's keep at it.  Let's find this jizzbucket Gellar.  Class dismissed.  Hey.  All that tippity tappy stuff you do on the laptop, you're kind of a whizz with computers, aren't you? I tool around.  I've done some consulting.  I've made a couple RPGs.  Role playing games.  Nice.  Any of them feature Amazon women of immense strength, by any chance?   No.    That's OK.  Anyway, you mind? Yeah, yeah.  Ice Truck Killer? Let's keep it down, all right? It was stolen from our evidence room, and if word gets out we're losing evidence, this department's street cred goes straight down the shitter.  Why don't you just get it back from the seller? I tried.  You have to give the site what you're selling before they agree to auction it.    Fuckers.    I see.  So, my question to you is Can I make this problem go away? I'll look into it.    Can I talk to you for a minute?   A minute.    This is awkward.    What? The engagement ring.  Fuck me in the ear, I never gave it back to you.  Yeah, it's just that I got 30 days to return it, and since we're not gonna use I'll get it back to you.  I'm so sorry.  It's OK.  I mean, you've had a lot on your plate lately.  I better go.  Got some professors to harass.    Hello?   Jamie, it's Debra.  I need a little favour from you.  About two weeks ago, I brought a ring box home with an engagement ring in it.  You lost an engagement ring? I left it on Harrison's side of the apartment.  Have you seen it? No.  Do you think you could look for it? I'd really appreciate all the help I can get right now.  Thank you.  Bye.    Hey, Dex.    Sam.  Hey.  Hey, how your little man doing? He's doing great.  You should come by and see him.  Yeah, OK.  I'd love to.  Yeah.  How about tonight? Great, great.  Well, say 8:00?   Perfect.    Cool.  Good.  You didn't come all the way out here just to ask about Harrison, did you? Yeah, I wish.  Some of Nick's old crew, they came by and shot up the shop.    Anybody hurt?   No, it was an after hours thing.  It's just bullet holes in the garage door.  That's about it.  I called the cops, but nobody showed up, so without the cop report, the insurance don't do shit.    You ever think of moving?   No.  God put me there to do what I'm doing, man.  I don't scare off.  You're a brave man, Sam.  O. G.  for G O D, know what I'm saying? Yep.  Nope.    See you tonight.    All right.  Excuse me, do you work here? Read my tag.  I'm a docent.  How may I help you? I accidentally poked a hole in a painting that belongs to my boss.  I put my elbow right through it.  I know.  I'm such an idiot.    Is there someone I can talk to   Follow me.  OK.    Here at the museum   Right in here.    Thank you.   a lot of the action is behind the scenes.  For nearly 35 years I'm sorry.  This isn't exactly Have you seen this before?   No.    Well, sit down and watch it.  It's very informative.  That's why we made it.  staining, colourations.  They can make the art look almost exactly the way the artist intended it, all while using the same materials that the artist used during his or her own lifetime.  You wouldn't believe how people end up treating what can end up being priceless works of art, especially in our paper conservation laboratory, where we're equipped with It's him.  The face I'm looking for.  He works here.  That's how he knew how to create those wings.  Morgan.  This is Detective Anderson.  Dispatch gave me your number.  We need a blood guy on the double.  We're out at Miami Shores.  Got it.  Using radiograms and infrared imaging Do you happen to know the name of Worst docent ever.  What do we got? Male and female.  Forties.  Pictures on the walls and rings on their fingers make them man and wife.  Three gunshots.  One to the chest, two to the stomach.  A fresh cut on the face not from a gunshot.    Maybe the fall.    No, he fell back.  It looks more like a glancing blow.  Cell phone.  Maybe she threw it at him.  That's not the wife.  Single gunshot to the chest, through and through, shot at close range.  No gun in sight.  Give me a hand.  We have our shooter.  The husband leaves, forgets his phone, the wife finds the pictures Wife throws phone at two timing bastard.  And shoots him.  Three times.  She realises what she did.  She's distraught.  She turns the gun to her chest and blam.  Murder suicide.  Took you all of 15 seconds to solve that.  It was a pretty easy one.  Hey, how the hell does a pro like you stand working with the rest of these Miami Homicide chuckleheads? No, they're actually pretty good, especially my sister Deb.  You probably know her as Lieutenant Morgan.    Excuse me, Detective?   Hey, you can't be in here.  No, no, no.  It's OK.  I own the place.  They just Oh, my God.  Can I help you? I don't mean to sound crass, but how long will they stay here? Till we finish.  Then the ME will remove the bodies.  And then how long will it take for you to clean it up? Do I look like your maid? It's hard not to look.  What? I'm sorry.  It's OK.  God gave man the desire to look at women.  It's the devil who made them dress like that.    That's not it.    What? It's sad.  All of these people are doomed, and they don't even know it.  It is sad.  You're very sensitive, Travis.  That's why you've been chosen.  Is that you? It's not bad, huh? They're calling you \"The Doomsday Killer\".  It's kind of catchy.  I probably should stay out of sight.  You may have to find our whore without me.    By myself? I can't.    Yes, you can.  I believe in you.  God believes in you.  I have a face.  Now I just need a name.  \"Ancient manuscript restoration and conservation.  \" No arrests, no warrants.  No moving violations, not even a parking ticket.  Appears you live a quiet little life on 1 742 Vanderan Street.  Ready to see Brother Sam?   Hey.    Hey, Sam.  Come on in.  Let me take those for you.  Nice.  Nice place you got here, man.  Thanks.  Hey, little man.  How you doing? He's sleepy.  It's about his bedtime.  I'm right on time then, cos it's his bedtime, too.  Maybe you could put him to sleep for me? Yeah? Can you say \"thank you\", Harrison? Thank you, Harrison, for helping me put my little man to sleep.    Either way, it's very nice of you.    Not a problem.  How's he doing after the surgery?   He's doing great.    That's good.  I'm gonna put him to bed.  I'll just be a few minutes.  All right.  Good night, little man.    Make yourself at home.    Thank you.  And now, I guess, Sam and I are gonna hang out.  That's a cute boy you got there, man.  Yeah, he's a keeper.  It must be kind of hard for you, man.  Just get up every day, leave, and go do what you do.  Do what I do? Homicide every day.  How you end up in that, man? My dad was a cop.  I just sort of fell into it.  Doesn't sound like the kind of thing somebody just fall into.  What really happened? I guess in a weird way I was sort of drawn to it,   the blood work.    Why? When I was three, I watched my own mother get killed.  Something like that stays with you.  That's rough, man.  I'm sorry.  Seeing that so young, the darkness got in deep.  Never left me.  Never will.  You remember anything before she died? I don't know.  I remember at night she would wrap me in a quilt and sing songs to me.  Sometimes she'd trace her finger along my ear.  Tickling me.  Must have made you feel good.  It did.  She was sharing that light with you.  It's with you now.  It's inside you.  Think you got the wrong guy.  You know, the good book tells us that there's no darkness that the light can't overcome.  So all the darkness that you think you got inside you   Yeah?   All it takes is just a little bit of light to keep it at bay.  Believe me.  I know.  It's like with your son, man.  And see? I just mention him, and you just light right up.  I guess I do.  And you're sharing that light with him every day, all the time.  You really think so? I see it.  You just got to let it out.  This is really nice, man.  We got to do this again sometime.  Hey! Hey, hey! Put her down! Get the fuck out of here! Help me! Help! Travis.    Where have you been?   I'm sorry.    I couldn't do it.  I I tried.    It's OK.  Many heroes of the faith have endured their failures.  God's grace prevailed then, too.  I thought I could do it.  It's my fault really.  I shouldn't have let you go do this alone.  Tomorrow night, I'll be there with you.  What about the police? Do you think God's gonna allow anything to slow us down now? You go home, get some rest.  Tomorrow night, we'll start again.  Tomorrow night.  Brother Sam says we all have a light inside us.  If I find Travis Marshall to be guilty, then I will snuff out his light.  He's neat.  Everything in its right place.  Masters degree in art history from the University of Tallahassee, the same place Gellar taught at before he disappeared.  I understand the urge to end someone's life, but what is this fascination with ending the world? Looks like the same numbers we found in the Doomsday victims.  Defacing a Bible.  I'm probably breaking a rule.  Hello, Doomsday Killer.  I swear to God, you're the only cop I know that drives the speed limit.  That car's not a toy.  In the right conditions, it'll top 1 1 0 easy.  And these weren't the right conditions? No.  Is that our professor? Professor Porter?   Yes.    Hi, I'm Detective Quinn.  This is Sergeant Batista.  Miami Metro Homicide.  Doctor Knudson, the department head, said we'd find you here.  Right.  He told me you were coming.  So you knew Professor Gellar? I did.  But I want to state upfront that Professor Gellar didn't have anything to do with those crazy Revelation killings.  And you know this how? I was his teacher's assistant for a year.  He even helped me get my job.  Have you seen him recently? No, not since he left.    When was that?   Three years ago, about.  What about his blog, The Beginning of the End? I mean, you have to admit, there's some pretty crazy stuff on there, and a lot of it is in line with the killings.  He likes to stir up trouble, make people think.  That's what made everyone love him.  So you loved him? Was he eccentric? Yeah.  But he was also smart, charismatic, brilliant even.  He saw things between lines of text that nobody else could.  Being with him was an incredible adventure.  So you did love him?   We were close.    Close? Smart woman like you, with your looks, I bet he was hitting on you all the time.  I mean, fuck, if we worked together, I'd have a hard time not wanting to get close to you.  It was more than just a flirtation.  We lived together.  For a while.  You're not together any more.  My year as his TA ended, he found another cute brunette, did the same thing with her.  Gellar had a thing for brunette students? I found out I was one in a long line of girls, but, you know what? It was no big deal.  I'm glad I got the chance to know him.  He was good to me.  Erin, our angel, was a brunette.  Well if by some miracle he contacts you You'll be the first one I call, if only to prove you have the wrong guy.  Hey Professor Porter, we're gonna be stuck here for the night.  You wouldn't happen to know of any good spots where we could get a drink this evening, would you? Like some place kind of quiet? Maybe I do.  Jesus Christ.  Do you always bring your work home with you? I can't work for fuck in my new office.  It's like LaGuerta's perfume seeped into the walls.  If she ever had a soul, it's still in there.  Life was so much simpler when all I had to do was solve murders.  Red to black.  What it's all about.  Who did it? Wife.  Murder suicide.  That brother of yours solved it like he was getting a message from the dead.  Yeah, he's something special.  Nice place.  Right by the beach, too.  Nothing like a murder suicide to fuck up a great house.  I've seen worse.  Male, 70s, self inflicted shotgun in the brainpan, which is bad enough, but he had cats   and they got hungry.    Enough said.  Chicago.  Miss it? Miss the food.  You can't get a decent hotdog anywhere.  But homicide is homicide.  Yeah.  I see the way you look at people around here.  You got the world's youngest LT, Batista and his hot rod, Masuka with I made the mistake of going in his lab unannounced.  He was Enough said.  He's got some fucked up shit going on, but he gets it done.  The same could be said for you.  Good night, Anderson.  I'm grading this paper, when all of a sudden I realise I've read this before.  No way.  This dumbass student changed some words around, but he plagiarised C. S.  Lewis.  C. S.  Lewis.  I should arrest this guy right now.  I've got my cuffs on me.  We can go.  I mean   That sounds like fun.    Yeah? You want another round? You're not married, are you? Definitely not.  Then I want another drink.  Another round, please.  Thank you.  Look who shows up when I'm buying drinks.  Listen, we got a long ride down to Miami tomorrow.  You want to call it? One second.  You can call it if you want, but I'm about to cross a fucking college professor off my bucket list.  Be careful, partner.  She's part of our investigation.  No, she's not.  She's just like a nice person we talked to, you know what I mean? There's like 20 other women here you could fuck.  I've already spent like so it's like, I don't want to have to start all over again.  Get out of here.  Come on.  We'll see each other in the morning, all right?   You're unbelievable.    Yeah, go on, baby.  And there they are.  Thank you.  Here's to you.  Hi, buddy.  Are you going to sleep? Are you going to bed? Are you tired?   Found your ring.    Oh, jeez, you're a lifesaver.  Deb, really? Shit.  He came in here to give you a good night kiss, not look at pictures of dead bodies.  Yeah, well, maybe if you gave me a little warning.  Isn't there anywhere else you can do this, Deb? Right now? No.  Nowhere.  Really? The lieutenant doesn't get an office? I don't like my office.  I like to work here.  Harrison's got an entire goddamn apartment over there.  I've got jack shit.  He just wanted to say good night.  I know that.  Next time, why don't you call me over there? I will.  From now on.  And maybe you could keep the photos on Dexter's desk, so Harrison won't see them.  Again, if you were doing your job, this wouldn't have happened in the first place.  My job?   Yes.    Really? You mean my job isn't to be your fucking maid?   I found it in Harrison's toy box.    Thank you.  Thanks.  You're really lucky he didn't eat it.  Please.    Thank God you're home.    Hello.  She needs to do a better job of watching Harrison.  She is bringing home all of these horrible pictures.  Would it be weird if I just left?   Please, Deb.   take care of this? Hey, Jamie, if Harrison's down for the night, maybe you should just go on home.    See you tomorrow.    OK.  Are you taking her side on this? No, I'll talk to her, too, tomorrow, but, Deb you gotta admit, this isn't good for Harrison.  Yeah.  I'm a mess.  Maybe I do need to go to therapy.  No more than me.  Am I that fucked up? Bet you they don't even know each other's names.  No wonder he wants us to end it all.  These two.  Follow them.  Are you sure? He looks pretty big.  He's not as big as God.  Go on.  Get the girl before somebody comes.  Put her in the trunk.  Help me.  I'm sorry.  See how easy it is? Come on.  Hey, come on in.    Where's Quinn?   Bathroom.  I'll get him.  Joey, your friend's here.  \"The Alpha and Omega of the Enesserette. \" Professor Porter, could you come out here? Excuse me, what are you doing? These drawings, they were Gellar's? You can't just start picking through Did Gellar do this?   What's going on?   Oh, my God.    Did he?   Well, yeah.  Let me see.  Holy shit.    Can I help you?   Michelle Ross.  The therapist you've been dodging forweeks.  Fuck.  I'm sorry.  Happens more than you'd think.  I figured since you weren't coming to my office That you would come to mine.  Believe me, I understand.  So we should probably get down to business, right? Right here, right now? Is that OK? Let's do this.  OK, just to clarify, this is in reference to the shooting at Don Aldo's? Have you been experiencing any lack of sleep   from the shooting in question?   From the shooting, no.  Have you found yourself dwelling on that day? No.  Who has time? Have you found it hard to concentrate on day to day tasks   because of the incident?   No.  Find yourself drinking more than you did before the shooting? Fuck, I don't drink enough.  That was a joke.  Have you been experiencing any guilt since the shooting? No.  If he walked through that door, I'd shoot him right now.  Great.  So it sounds like everything's fine.  Yeah.  Everything's great with the shooting.  It's just everything that's happened since then that's fucking me up.  Like what? Like being lieutenant.  And all the day to day bullshit that comes with it.  Got the Doomsday Killer doing his shit in my city and I try to do any work in here, and I can't, and Did I mention I just broke up with my boyfriend and I don't have a place to live any more, so, at the end of the day, I can't even go home? I'm living with my brother and his son, and Don't get me wrong, I love them, it's just There's a reason I'm an aunt and not a parent and I just feel like I don't have a space to call my own right now.  So maybe you should get some place that's your own.  Detective Anderson and girlfriend.  Her? No way.  I'm married.  She's my boss.  Lieutenant Debra Morgan, Miami Metro Homicide.  I'm so sorry.  I thought that you two   Don't worry about it.    My bad.  Can we get this crime scene tape down? Wow, it takes a lieutenant to tell me it's OK to rent this place.    Can we go inside?   By all means.  Thank you.  I wanted to come by and see if I could possibly rent the place.  The floors are a mess.    Yeah, they are, aren't they?   Yes, they are.  Might have to replace them.    I mean, the toxic damage.    Toxic? Blood borne antigens.  Can live for two weeks easy.  Of course, hep C is always a risk.  I didn't know that.  Oh, God, just what I needed.  Look, it's no secret you're gonna have a hell of a time renting this place.  Legally, you're required to disclose the murder suicide.    But I already know about it.    And? What if I was to give you two thirds of the current rent right now, today? Make that three quarters, two year lease, and you clean up the place.  Looks like you got yourself a new tenant.  What's the What's the progress on the Yeah, all right, I did everything I know how, but I wasn't able to get the hand back.  The buyer bought it using an E sniper programme that firewalls the buyer, so whoever's got it's got it for good.    Fuck.    However I do like the sound of your however.  I erased any trace of the sale from the Internet.  So I'm sorry, that's the best I can do.  So if one were to look online It's like it never happened.  And I never checked it out of evidence.  There's no trail coming back to here.  At the worst, the evidence room fucked up, not us.  Our department's safe.  And while I was on your computer, I improved your credit rating, installed a modded up Intel chip to over clock your CPU and, most importantly, I added a porn scrubber to that thing.  My man.  Give it up, Lou.  Thank you.  Drive out of the parking structure, turn right on Flagler and then drive on past the Miami River.  Nod if you understand.  You can take the car.  It's yours, my wallet, whatever you want.  I want none of those things, Travis.    What do you want?   I want your life.  Just like the ones you took.  Doomsday Killer.  God.  God! Yeah, let's start with him.  I suppose it was God who told you to kill all those innocent people.  God doesn't talk to me.  Then how do you know? He talks to Professor Gellar.  And how do you know he talks to God? Cos I've seen it.  God speaks to the professor.  He speaks through the professor.  Keep going.  Before I met him, I was lost.  But then the professor, he showed me the truth.  He showed me the way.  He's a prophet filled with truth and light.  Bullshit! You killed those people because you like it.  Answer me! I couldn't do it.  I'm a failure.  I'm failing God.  Do you have any idea what that feels like? Yes, yes, I wanted to kill those people, but I couldn't.  You're saying Gellar does the killing? He's so much stronger than me.  With him, there's there's no fear, there's no regret.  But with me it's it's pathetic.  Gellar is pulling you toward the darkness, Travis, not the light.  No, you don't know.  Trust me, I know more about darkness than most, and Gellar is pure darkness.  You need to find someone else to follow.  Pull over.    Get out of the car.    What? Get out and start walking away.  You'll find your car back at the museum.  One way or another, Travis will lead me to the one who really deserves my table.  Where are you? I'm on my way home.    What's going on?   I don't feel good.  I've got I just feel sick.  I should get some sleep.  Travis, what are you not telling me? Nothing.  Nothing.  I just I feel sick.    I'll see you tomorrow?   Hey! You remember the story about Jonah and the great fish? Jonah tried to run from God.  He didn't get too far.  Hope you're not trying to run from God, too.  Think about it.  I don't believe in angels, but I do believe there's a constant struggle between light and dark in the world.  Who knows? Maybe Brother Sam is right.  Maybe sometimes the light can win out.  But in my experience, darkness usually prevails.      Previous EpisodeNext Episode"

        "script": "Previously on Dexter Is this Doomsday number two? Travis Marshall.  Professor Porter, you wouldn't happen to know of any good spots where we could get a drink this evening, would you? Maybe I do.  These drawings, they were Gellar's? No! Seems Brother Sam's not a changed man after all.  Please get off the property.  Not without our boy Nick.  You deaf, pendejo? See how easy it is? Get out and start walking away.  One way or another, Travis will lead me to the one who really deserves my table.  Most people believe we have free will, that we all choose our path.  Sometimes the path is clear.  Sometimes, not so much.  Every twist, every turn can challenge our sense of direction.  But it's the choices we make when we reach a fork in the road that define who we are.  Deb, I'm kind of busy.  Can Dex, I'm sorry, I have bad news.  It's Brother Sam.  He's been shot,   at his garage.    What? EMTs are working on him now.  I'm on my way there.    I'll meet you there.    No, wait Shit.  I think this will be sufficiently tawdry for our purposes.  Pay the woman.  Ma'am.    We're almost ready.    About the woman She didn't die, did she? No, but her arm is badly broken.  I'd like to get her some painkillers.    No, Travis.    But she's in agony.  She's a whore.  She's an unrepentant sinner.  She deserves what she's gonna get.  Have you given her her mark? No, not yet.  What's wrong with you, Travis?   What do you mean?   You're hesitating.  You're slacking off.  You better get yourself together.  You know what's at stake here.  We're the chosen ones.  We're the two witnesses.  But what if it's wrong? What we're doing, hurting these people God can be wrong? I don't think so.  Do what you're told to do, Travis, or you're gonna be destroyed along with the rest of the scum.  It's bad.  There are three entrance wounds, two in the chest, one in the back.  No exit wounds.  Bullets bounced around, really tore him up.  Whoever did this to Brother Sam doesn't deserve to live.  Whoa, whoa, what are you doing? My job.  I'm sorry, Dex, I can't let you do that.  You and Sam are friends.  Deb, I'm fine.  Really.  The last thing you need is another unsolved case.  You need my help.  I need to do this.  Hey, hey! Somebody get this dog out of here.    I got him.    What do we have? Register's clean.  Looks like a robbery gone bad.  Or Julio's gang finally got even with Brother Sam for stealing Nick away.    I suppose it's too much to hope   It is.  DVD's missing.  Whatever happened to stupid criminals? They're still stupid.  We'll catch this piece of shit.  The likely shooter is Julio's replacement.  Taking out Brother Sam would be a good way to boost his cred as shot caller.  See, Louis, the art of dusting Iies in the caressing of the powder over the print, so as not to corrupt it, as if one was trying to get a nipple erect.  Like this.  What's the blood telling you? The spray pattern suggests the shooter stood here.  Bang, bang.  Victim stumbled to the car and fell here.  Frothy blood suggests a tracheal haemorrhage and that the victim fell to his knees, but the drainage from the interior wounds is pooled, not smeared, so he must have rolled to his side, and the shooter steps forward for the kill shot.  Bang.  Victim rolls to his back.  That's how we found him.  The awkward position of the body causes the bullet to miss the heart.  It's probably the only reason he's still alive.  Guy's a fucking rock star.  Hey, this is Miami fucking Metro.  We're all fucking rock stars.  Harrison seemed a little off this morning.  Is it all right if I check in with Jamie? Sure.  The night Julio and his crew came for Nick, I hit one of them with a baseball bat.  He seemed like Julio's number two, which could mean he's now number one.  Blood.  If he's in the system, I'll have a name.  We have a match.  Leo Hernandez.  Two felony arrests, as well as one for failure to pay child support.  What are the odds you're at your last known address? Hello? Yes, hello, I'm calling for Leo Hernandez.  Who is this? The Department of Social Services.  Lieutenant, I ran the prints from the garage.  I got 12 hits on AFIS.  All of them work for Brother Sam.  Well, that really fucking narrows it down.  Maybe one of his ex cons got tired of working for a living.  Yale, Soderquist, I want statements and alibis from everyone on the garage payroll.  Yeah, I'm sorry.  He sounds like a horrible baby daddy.  You and your children deserve better.  She hasn't seen Leo in over a year.  Now what? Any news on Brother Sam's condition? Last I heard, he was still in surgery.  Hey, I got something.  Eighth Street Locos blame Brother Sam for the disappearance of their shot caller, Julio Benes.  I killed Julio.  Is it possible this is my fault? And according to this report filed two days ago, Brother Sam suspected the Locos of shooting up his garage.  So maybe his motive was revenge and not robbery.  Or revenge, then robbery.  Hit the street.  See if you can't narrow it down to a triggerman.  Got it.  Deb, if it's OK, I'm gonna swing by the hospital and check in on Brother Sam.  Sure.  Hey, what's up? Just getting some rocket fuel, keep the engines burning.  Me, too.  Better get back to it.  Relax, I didn't come over here to crack the whip.  I've just been going so hard lately, I haven't had a chance to catch up.  What's going on?   I'm good.    Me, too.    Can we get back to work now?   Yeah, fucking go.  I'm taking a lot of heat on Doomsday.  The commissioner, the mayor's office, the media are all over me.  Are we making any headway? Quinn and Batista are going through our suspect Professor Gellar's boxes.  I was about to get an update.  Good, do that.  And remember, you're lieutenant now, not one of the gang.  I'm realising that.  OK, well, I'd like a briefing later today.  OK.  If you're lying there because of my dark passenger, I promise you, my dark passenger will make amends.  The Lord is my light and my salvation.  Hey, Nick, how are you? Whom should I fear? The Lord is my life's refuge.  Been trying to do good.  How could this happen to Brother Sam? It's a hard question to answer.  I'd rather focus on who did it.  One thing I ask of the Lord.  This I seek.  Is Leo Hernandez the new shot caller for the Locos? You here as a friend or a cop? I'm not a cop.  I'm a forensic analyst and a friend.  And you and I both know the Locos wanted Brother Sam dead.  Where can I find him? I ain't no rat.  If Leo shot Brother Sam, he doesn't deserve your loyalty.  Come on, Nick, if you don't tell me, the cops are gonna drag it out of you.  I'll keep your name out of it.  They won't.  He stays over on St Andrews.  The white house near Romaine.  Brothers and sisters, let us pray together for our friend Brother Sam.  Please join hands.  Please hear our prayer, Lord, as we gather in your name.  Lord, we ask you to heal our Brother Sam and bring him back to us, because we need him.  He's your shining light among us.  He helps us see the way.    Amen.    Amen.  And now in the name of forgiveness, let us say a silent prayer for the misguided sinner who shot Brother Sam.  Forget it.  Anger won't bring him back.  I'd rather prey on him.  Here's where we are.  Professor Gellar's former TA, Carissa Porter   The one you got the boxes from.    Right.  She told us that Gellar was working on a theory about an early AD cult, the Enesserette, who believed that the Book of Revelations was not only a biblical prophecy, but some kind of code to bring about the end of the world.  I have no idea what that means.  According to Gellar's papers, he thought he had deciphered the code.  Seven steps or keys, each requiring a human sacrifice.  We think that the Doomsday tableaus are an enactment of these keys.  Jesus.  I thought this crazy fuck was trying to warn us about the end of the world.  You're telling me he's trying to cause it? There's more.  We found a clipping from a college newspaper from a little over three years ago, and it says that Gellar did an artistic installation on campus drawing attention to his work on the Enesserette cult.  It got him in hot water with the university.  The dead lamb represents sacrifice, the naked chick represents sinfulness It looks like a practise run for his current work.  If we could find that girl in the photo, who knows what she could tell us? Is that marking on her lower back part of the tableau? Not sure.  We just found this before you walked in.  We haven't had a chance to go over it in detail.    You got a magnifying glass?   Yeah.  Looks like a tattoo.  One of those Hindu Om dealios.  Wrong religion, sweetie.  Good find, Deb.  We'll take it from here.    Oh, I can help, if you want.    No, no, no.  You've got a lot on your plate, so It's OK, Deb, we got this.  We'll get back to you.  What? The chick in the photo is Carissa Porter.  What? Are you sure? The tat above her ass?   I was in the vicinity.    Shit.  She just became our key witness.  I told you not to go home with her.  Didn't I tell you? Yes, you told me, Mom.  The question is, what are we gonna do about it now? Well, we gotta find out what else Carissa Porter knows.  That That's fine.  But we can't let Deb know about this, cos that could make things a lot harder for me.  Lie to Deb? No way.  Oh, so you're just gonna turn your back on your partner? Oh, no, no, no.  Do not play the partner card.  Of course I'm gonna play the partner card.  Why wouldn't I play the partner card? Situations like this are exactly why the partner card is in the fucking deck! I'm really not liking you right now.  Deb, you got a sec? What's up? Quinn and I have to go to Tallahassee tomorrow to question Carissa Porter.  I thought you already interviewed her.  We did.  We have reason to believe that she's the naked woman in the newspaper photo.  No shit.  How'd you figure that out? Just meticulous police work.  Fucking A.  She's gotta be able to help us get closer to Gellar.  But I can't spare you guys for a whole day.  Have her come here.  What? Bring her into the station.  I don't know if she's gonna go for that.  She's a professor.    She's got classes to teach.    Fuck her classes.  She's a material witness in a serial murder investigation.  Tell her to get her Om tattooed ass into this station by tomorrow afternoon, or I'll have her hauled in here in handcuffs.    Try it nicely first.    Yeah.  Fuck.  What if Carissa says something about our night together? I'll handle it.  You just stay the hell away from her.    Hi, Jamie.    Hi.    Harrison go down easy?   Totally.  We went to the park this afternoon.  So it was like one page of Goodnight Moon, and then the sandman dropped the whole bag on him.  You know, you don't have to do that.  Deb said she'd be by this weekend to get the rest of her stuff.  Oh, no, I'm happy to do it.  There we go.  All folded and packed with very little hostility.  Guess I'll hit the road.  I heard about your friend, Brother Sam.  How's he doing? He's in a coma.  It doesn't look good.  I'm really sorry.  He seemed like a really nice guy.  Yeah, I didn't know him that well.  It definitely sucks.  Well, I'll see you in the morning.  Good night.  Thanks.  Why is it so hard for you to admit? You care about Brother Sam.  It doesn't make sense.  Who is he to me? A fellow traveller.  He was a killer at one time.  But he found a new path, a path I could never take.  It's because he's travelled both roads that he understands the darkness in you and he sees the light.  I wish I did.  Maybe things could have been different.  What ifs are a waste of time.  I've accepted my dark passenger.  But there's more to you than that.  Brother Sam sees it, and he's helped you see it.  That's what he is to you.  So is there anything else you want to talk about? Nope.  You sure? Yep.  OK.  Well, as far as the shooting at Don Aldo's, you're good to go.  There's no need for us to meet again.    There's one more thing.    Yes? I feel like my whole world has been turned upside down.  That's kind of more than an afterthought.  Go on.  For the first time, I feel lost in a place that's always felt like home.  I look at my co workers and I see the doubt in their eyes, and it makes me doubt myself.  I mean, they used to be my friends.  Now they're my subordinates.  It used to be simple.  I feel like shit about Quinn.  I think he thinks that I dumped him because I think I'm better than him now.  And I used to be able to talk to Batista, but that's awkward because I made lieutenant over him.  I still have Dexter.  We've always been close, since we were kids.  But that's different, too, because It's weird to be my big brother's boss.  I just don't know how to act around anyone any more.    So don't.    What? Don't act.  Just be, Debra.  You're too much in your head.  You're You're thinking too much.  Just do the job, live your life, and give it all a chance to sort itself out.  I don't know if I know how to do that any more.  What would you be doing right now if you hadn't gotten this promotion? If I wasn't lieutenant? If I didn't have briefings and reports and meetings coming out of my ass? Yeah.  I would probably throw a housewarming party at my new beach house.  Well, that sounds like a lot more fun than worrying about all this other stuff.  For a shrink, you're not that annoying.  Thanks.  Not that you'd ever need a shrink, but You might need a bookmark.  I would guess it's obvious that people who party all night also don't get up in the morning, but I'm finding it very inconvenient.  Come on, Leo.  Wake up.    Cops, man.    Oh, fuck.  Oh, fuck.    Fuck you, man.    Hey, behave.  That's my little gentleman.  Now, I know the Locos are the supplier for this neighbourhood.  And I'm guessing that you, being a savvy consumer, have kept abreast on who's running their operation now.    I don't know shit.    I just don't believe you.  I'm afraid you leave me no choice but to flamingo your ass.    Ass What?   It's a Chicago thing.  It's ironic, because we don't actually have flamingos in Chicago.  You actually have them here in Miami, and yet you don't flamingo people.  I'll catch you later.  Wait! Yeah.  The new Locos shot caller is Leo Hernandez.  Drives a black muscle car, similar to the vehicle ID'd at the garage drive by.  Operates out of a house at the intersection of St Andrews and Romaine.  I'll send backup.  About time, Leo.  Police officer! Hold it right there.  Hold it!   He's coming out!   Hands up.  Come on.  Go, go! He's down.  Hold your fire.  Get in to secure the weapon! Clear! Pull it in! Is this the Locos' shot caller? Yeah, recently retired.  Hey, Dexter, can I watch you do the blood work? Louis, we're learning fingerprints.  You're not ready for blood.  Come on.  Leo, you're not going in my slide box, but justice has been done.  So why doesn't it feel better? Think you got the right guy? In the sense that he was trying to blow my head off? Definitely.  As to Brother Sam, I'll know when I find the 9mm that put the holes in him.  DVD player's on.  Security disc.  From the garage.  OK.  It's not a slam dunk.  That looks like Leo.  He had on the same sweatshirt when he was shot, he had the disc in his possession, and Yale has two witnesses who say Leo was bragging he was gonna \"smoke that negro pendejo, Brother Sam. \" That sounds like it should hold.  Good work, Mike, everyone.  Oh, if you haven't heard, there's a party at my place tonight.  BYOB.  Not because I'm cheap.  It's just cos I don't have time to buy booze.  This doesn't make up for Brother Sam, but at least we got the bad guy.  Yeah.  Something's not right.  Eli isn't barking.  If Leo were the man in the hood, the dog would be going crazy.  The only person other than Brother Sam Eli doesn't bark at is Nick.  I'm sorry, but the professor said no painkillers.  Please, just let me go.  I can't do that.  I have a son.  A little boy.  He needs his mother.  Please.  I can tell you're a good person.  Please, help me.    Well, look who's here!   Hey, Lisa.  Class, this is my brother Travis.  Can you say hello? Hi! This is such a surprise.  I mean, I'm I'm thrilled.  But you've You've never visited me at school before.  Just needed to see you.  That's music to my ears.  You wanna paint with us? Oh, no.  I I have to get going.  Come on.  Class! Travis is a very talented artist.  Don't you think he should join us?   Yeah.    Yeah.  OK, OK, just a little bit.    Yay!   Yes! So what are we painting? We're painting whatwe're gonna be when we grow up.  I'm gonna be a nurse like my mom.  That's a great thing to be.    What about you?   I'm gonna be a Transformer.  Oh, scary.  Don't you envy them? So full of dreams.  And all the time in the world to make them come true.  The night Brother Sam carried Nick from his apartment, Nick fired a shot at him.  From the couch, I'm guessing, since he was stoned.  So the bullet should be here.  Did it come from the same gun that shot Brother Sam? The striations match the bullet taken from Brother Sam.  Nick shot Sam, the man who tried to save him.  He's the ultimate Judas.  Thank you for coming down on such short notice, Professor Porter.  You didn't give me much choice.  I hope you understand that we're trying to solve a series of brutal murders, and your cooperation is very important.  I don't see how.  I already told you everything I know and I gave you Gellar's boxes.  Professor Porter, are you the woman in that photo? Yes.  Why didn't you tell us about this? To tell you the truth, I'd forgotten about it.  Ma'am, you are lying naked in the middle of campus with a dead sheep on your head.  That's not the kind of thing that just slips your mind.  Look, if that photo got out, I would look like a total flake to my The faculty.  Quinn.  Why aren't you in there with your witness? I had paperwork backing up, so Angel took this one.  Paperwork? She's a material witness in the fucking Doomsday murders.  Come on, get in there.  Professor Porter, did you Do you share any of Professor Gellar's religious beliefs? I didn't know he had any religious beliefs.  He was an academic.  Professor Porter.  Detective? So that would be a no.  You're not a believer in apocalyptic prophecies.  Of course not.  Look I was just a prop.  I was young.  I was trying to win favour with my professor.  Well, kind of an unorthodox way to go about it.  He was an unorthodox man.    Has Gellar contacted you?   No.  I told you.  I haven't seen or talked to him in over three years.  Well, you didn't tell us about the photo, so you could see how we might be a little sceptical.  What the hell is going on here? You think because I posed for a photo once, that I'm somehow involved in all of this? No one said anything about you being involved.  But you're acting like I'm guilty of something.  Not at all, Miss Porter.  We're just trying to ascertain the full nature of your relationship with Professor Gellar.  I told you the full nature of the relationship.  I was his TA, and for a brief time, we were lovers, but that's over.  Are you sure about that? Jesus.  If we were still involved, would I have slept with Mr Warmth over here? Or are you implying that I'm a whore as well as an accomplice to murder? Professor Porter, can we just stay on the subject here? No.  I've had enough of this.  I'm leaving now.  You bother me again, I'll get a lawyer.  Goodbye, Joey.  Leave us.  Are you out of your mind? You fucked a person of interest? Who fucks a person of non interest? This is no time to be a smartass.  I could have you fired.  That woman was the key to interpreting all of the Gellar evidence.  She's never gonna fucking cooperate with us now.  Is that really what's bothering you? What? What What the fuck else? Maybe you're jealous.  Are you kidding? I could give a fuck who you fuck.  Just don't fuck with my investigation, you fuck.  Well, I guess we're off.  You sure Deb invited me? I really do not want to crash a party with your son.  Yes, I'm sure, have fun.  I'll be there later, after I take care of my business.  Sending Nick in pieces to the bottom of the bay.  Hello? Of course, right away.  Thank you for coming.  It was really important to Sam that he talk to you.  This is good news, right? He's regained consciousness.  Probably not.  Doctor says sometimes people come out of comas before He doesn't have long.  Sam.  I'm here.  Don't worry.  I know it was Nick who shot you.  I'm gonna make sure he pays.  No.  Don't do that.  I don't understand.  I want you to to give Nick a message from me.  Yes.  Tell him that I forgive him.  What? You're the only one that I trust to do it.  I didn't tell anybody.  The boys from the shop, they wouldn't They They're not ready.  You're wrong, I can't do this.  You can.  You don't know me.  Yes, I do.  I know about your darkness.  But I also see your light.  If there's light in me, I don't feel it.  I just wanna hurt Nick.  You don't know how much I wanna hurt him.  You need to forgive him.  I don't know how.  Just let it go.  Can't live with the hate in your heart.  Eat you up inside.  We gotta find some peace in life.  Nick doesn't deserve it.  It ain't about him.  Dexter, if you don't let that darkness go, it won't let go of you.  Let it go.  Let it go.  For you.  You can just put it on the liquor table.  No, no This is a special bottle.  It's a housewarming/apology gift.  I should have told you about Quinn and Carissa Porter.  Yeah, you should've.  I hope it doesn't hurt us with Doomsday.  Me, too.  Why couldn't you trust me, Angel? I do trust you.  Of course I do.  It's just that Quinn's my partner, and you're the boss.  I guess I haven't adjusted yet.  Well, that makes two of us.  It was the wrong way to go.  It won't happen again.  Here.  It better not.  And this bottle better cost at least $50.  Not even close.  Harrison's out like a light on your bed.  But if that's inconvenient, I can totally move him.  It's fine.  Oh, and Dexter said to tell you that he'll be late, but he'll be here.    OK, thanks.    Sure.  Jamie, I feel like we got off on the wrong foot.    What do you say we start over?   I'd like that.  Then how about we have some of this fancy ass tequila? I never say no to fancy ass anything.  Let me ask you a question.  Is Dexter as cool at home as he is at work? Why? Is he, like, your hero or something? Yeah, right.  That That would make me a nerd, which clearly I'm not.  Hey, you fucks.  Let's get the party started.  Oh, God.  Please tell me he didn't drive.  No, my lovely assistant did.  Debra, chick from bar.  Chick from bar, Debra.  I'm sorry, Lieutenant Debra, her royal fucking majesty, Cindy.  Feel free to hang all over me, babe, because Debra here is completely over my shit.  Wait a minute.  This is your ex? You brought me to your ex girlfriend's house? No, actually, you brought me.  Have a nice life.  Damn, I just keep getting dumped.  Let go of the darkness.  How is that even possible? Has Satan brought you here, Travis, or has God? God.  I'm glad to hear that.  Everything's ready to mark the whore.  I have to go out and do further preparation.  When I come back, I expect it to be done.  Who's there? What's happening? No, no, no, no, no, no, no.    What's happening?   Get out.  Where are you taking me? No, please.  You're free.  So were you hoping to become a forensic analyst or whatever? Actually, I already have a career.  I create video games.  Wow, that's so cool.  So why are you a lab intern then? Oh, I'm I'm developing a new game about homicide.  I just figured it was a great way to do research.  I'm sorry, but you must be, like, a model, right? Because there's just no other explanation.  Hey, excuse me, we were kind of talking.  Exactly.  Were.  Run along back to the lab, Igor.  I think I better go check on Harrison.    Yeah.    Excuse me.    Okay.    Sorry.  Move!   Hey, buddy.    Hey! Why don't you give my sister a little space? I can't help it.  She has an outrageous ass.  That's enough.  I wanna have a relationship with that ass.  I wanna have babies OK, Quinn, I think it's time we call you a cab.  You ever love me? Now is not the time.  Come on, Deb.  It's not that hard of a question.  Did you ever love me? That's what I thought.  I'm sorry.  He's gone.  That's it.  Brother Sam is gone.  Will you honour his dying wish? Forgive Nick? I want to.  What did Brother Sam say? Just let it go.  Let go of the darkness this one time, and show Nick the light.  I've accepted the path I'm on.  But can I take a detour with Nick for Brother Sam? One thing is certain.  There's no way to get around the fork in the road.    Hey, Dexter.    Hey.  I'm glad I ran into you, I was hoping we could talk.  Let's go for a ride.  Dexter Morgan.  Please leave a message at the tone.  Where are you, bro? You gonna tell me what this is about now? Don't you recognise this place? It's a beach.  It's the beach where you were baptised.  So? So I thought it would be a good place for you to explain yourself.  What are you talking about? Brother Sam regained consciousness.  I know you shot him, Nick.  You gonna arrest me? I keep telling you, I'm not a cop.  What do you want? I want to know why.  Why'd you do it? I don't know.  You don't know? You don't know why you put three bullets in a man who only wanted to help you? Who believed in you? Who sacrificed for you? A man who gave you a home.  A man who baptised you.  Because he's full of shit! He gave me hope, but nothing changed.  My life was shit before he dunked me under those waves, and it's still shit.  He lied to me.  My homies never did that.  So you went back to them.  They wouldn't take me.  Not unless I proved myself.  Leo wanted Sam dead.  That's why you gave him the security disc.  Here I am.  The fork in the road.  Brother Sam loved you, Nick.  Then why'd he rat me out to you? He didn't.  He sent me to forgive you.  Brother Sam forgives you for gunning him down like a dog.  Your life might not have changed, but his did.  Hey, look, I've gotta talk to him, all right? We can work this out.  I can't go back to jail.  He's dead.  What? He died about an hour ago, which makes you a murderer.  Turn yourself in to the police.  They'll find you anyway.  No, they won't.  The only witness is dead.  There ain't nothing on that disc.  It's my word against yours.  They got no proof.  Nobody can do anything! Sweet Jesus! I can't believe this worked out, man.  There's no light in you.  There's no light in me.  Hey, little brother.  Miss me?       Previous EpisodeNext Episode"

I can't leave my mom and sister alone with him.  Everything's ready to mark the whore.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  No, please.    Where are you taking me?   You're free.  I know it was Nick who shot you.  Tell him that I forgive him.  He's dead, which makes you a murderer.  They got no proof.  Nobody can do anything! Hey, little brother.  Miss me? I've been lost before.  After Rita died, after Lumen left.  But now I've been found.  Brian Moser, my dead brother, it's been a long time since I've seen him.  Too long.  Here.  Catch.  You used to love to play.  Why the long face? Brother Sam had hoped I'd be able to forgive Nick for shooting him.  Cos you don't turn the other cheek, you slice it.  Brother Sam doesn't know you like Brother Brian does.  Admit it.  You're a little glad to see me.    I feel   Relieved? Relieved.  Unburdened.  Like maybe I can stop pretending.  Pretending there's any light in me.  Feel that sun.  Feels good, doesn't it? You know, we don't have to go back.  We could keep going.  It's Debra.  The one that got away.  Hey, Deb, what's up? I'll get there as soon as I can.  We'll talk about this later.  Closing the door.  Must be serious.  Very serious.  It's Trinity.  He's back.  He killed again.    He What?   Two people.  Family members, his wife, Sally Mitchell, and his daughter Rebecca.  Witpro placed the Mitchells in the middle of Bumfuck, Nebraska, and somehow Trinity managed to track them down.  Well, not Trinity.  You killed Trinity.  What about his son, Jonah? Trinity came after him, too, but Jonah survived the attack.  How lucky.  Didn't he say what happened? According to his statement, Jonah came home from work and saw Trinity push Sally down the stairs and begin to beat her.  Jonah fought him off.  Trinity ran.  And Jonah went upstairs and found Rebecca dead in a tub.  Or Jonah killed them and is masquerading as the Trinity Killer.  And this all happened in Nebraska? Some town called Kearney.  Road trip.  Brother Sam's death is hard enough on you, I'm sure, and to top it off with this Let's go kill Jonah.    I I'm gonna need some time.    Whatever you need.  Take the day.  \"Carnival. \"   What?   Nothing.  I just love having you here.  Usually when you come to stay with me, there's some problem that you need help with.  I can't, for the life of me, figure out how how to turn off the predictive text on my phone.  Do you have any idea how to do that? I texted my boss that I had two tickets to jizz fest.  Well, maybe you'll get a promotion.  Well, I wouldn't hold my breath on that one.  Your boss doesn't mind you not coming in? My boss thinks I'm out tracking down an ancient manuscript from a private collector.  You sure you can't get the whole day off? Parent/teacher conferences are a bitch to reschedule.  I'll only be a few hours.    I'm done.    Done? With you.  With everything.  God is the one with choice, Travis.  He chose you and me.  We, however, have no say.  What about free will? Please.  Let me inside.  No.  You see? Free will.  God's will doesn't stop just because you want to play house with your sister.  Until this little detour of yours is over, I will carry on his work.  For the both of us.  Rebecca Mitchell.  Severed femoral artery.  She bled out in minutes.    Razor blade?   Check.    Mirror?   Check.  Sally Mitchell.  She was pushed down the stairs, but that's not what killed her.  She suffered blunt force traumas to the head, neck and chest.  She was bludgeoned.  Was it with a hammer? Hockey stick.  A girl dead in the bathtub, a mom pushed and bludgeoned.  Kind of an efficient little combo pack there.  Jonah's been a very good student.  But Jonah loved his mom and sister.  When has love ever kept people from killing one another? You and I both know how easy it would be to choke Becca out.  Jonah climbs in the tub behind her, cuts off her airway, opens her artery.  Now, Mommy, it's kind of genius of Jonah to bludgeon her on the staircase, why? Because the castoff pattern is consistent with Trinity's height.  Jonah stands on the highest step, and suddenly he's as tall as good old dad.  Kid has some real talent.  It's in his blood.  Son of a serial killer becomes a killer.  What are the odds? Let's go play in your room.  Cute kid.  My nephew.  Kearney, Nebraska is a mere 30 hours from Miami, FLA.  Thirty one if you must stop along the way.  We could rent a car, take I 95 north.  Don't tell me you're having second thoughts.  What about DDK? Miami Metro could get to them first.    They're not even close!   I don't know.  When you 86'ed Trinity, you gave Jonah the perfect alibi to get away with murder.  I know how much you hate it when people get away with murder.  Everyone, that is, except for you.  So I'm a little, what, responsible for this happening? Your life is nothing but responsibility.  Look around, Dexter.  Look at your life! Sippy cups, poopy diapers, baby monitors! You've been domesticated! You need to take this trip.  Come on, Dexter.  When was the last time you had fun? Thanks for coming over on such short notice.  No problem.  I shouldn't be gone more than four or five days.  Come in.  Timing's perfect.  The first chapter of my dissertation is due next week, and I never get anything done at home, especially when Angel's there.  It's Brother Sam, isn't it? You miss him.  I just need to get away from it all.  I'll only bug you if it's super important.    Where you going?   I'm not sure.  Maybe down to the Keys, wherever the road takes me.  Well, have fun.  Let's get you to bed.    I love you.    Wow.  \"Love. \" Really? It's weird seeing you with a kid.  Let's go to Nebraska.  Starting your mornings off right, Georgia's Heart to Heart, Rock Hits 96.  Deb, hey, it's me.  You know, I'm gonna need more than a day to clear my head.  It's hard to concentrate.  There's a lot to digest, I guess.  I'll be back in four days, five tops.  Hope that hearing thing goes well.  Seventy percent of the murders in my district were by firearms.  What percentage of murders is by spiked collar? I created a separate category for the Doomsday Killer murders.  So that those unsolved cases don't count against your clearances? What is your division's clearance rate? Forty two percent.  Add back in the open DDK murders, and your clearance rate drops to Twenty nine percent, but I can explain Numbers can't hear you.  Moving on.  Hey.  Six of those murders happened on your watch, before I took over.  The clearance rate is a running total.  It doesn't matter who was in the lieutenant's position.  If it doesn't fucking matter, then what was that in there? Cos it felt personal.  That was my first COMPSTAT hearing, as a captain.  So you were just as nervous as I was.  But it has to be a fuckload easier to sit there and listen to stats than it is to present them.  It is.  But as your captain, they're my stats, too, so they have to be accurate.  My numbers are lousy.  Makes me feel lousy.  That's why I like COMPSTAT.  It's just numbers.  Look, I don't know what happened between you and Quinn, but I lost a relationship because of this job, and I take great comfort in the pure objectivity of numbers.  At COMPSTAT, there's no age, no gender, no feelings.  Improve your numbers, and everything will change.  I promise you.  And if you don't catch DDK, you will crash and burn.  Hey, bro, I got your message.  I know this is a tough time for you, so take today off.  But please don't take four.  What's left of my ass just got handed to me on a paper plate at the COMPSTAT hearing.  DDK is either gonna make my career or end it.  I need your help.  She's cute.  No.  I keep telling you no.  Go talk to her, Dexter.  I told you I don't like fucking when your mom's home.  Register's over here.  I gotta go.  Smile, Dexter.  You know, if it's any consolation, I think boundaries are good in a relationship.  Is that right? Let's do her.  I, for example, would never fuck anyone if my mom were home.  Or I should say if my adoptive mother were home.  I could never have fucked anyone if my actual mother were home, cos she was murdered in front of me when I was three.  Is that right? I don't see any mothers around here.  Do you? That was Thanks.  Wouldn't it have been more fun to kill her than fuck her? I got what I wanted.  Right through the \"O\".  I don't even like guns.  Faster! Let's go faster! Try different targets.  Something more familiar.  Gospel Hour is happy to welcome Pastor Bill O'Connor of Kearney's First United Methodist Church.  He will command his angels, concerning you, and they will lift you up in their hands, so that you will not strike your foot against a stone.  A twister would do this town a favour.  Stay here.  I want to talk to Jonah face to face.  Hello, Dexter Morgan.  After Rita Morgan died, Kyle Butler's face was all over the news as her grieving husband.  That's when we realised Kyle Butler was really Dexter Morgan.  No one connected the dots for the FBI.  We talked about it, but decided as a family that you tried to help us.  So we tried to help you.  But why did you lie about who you were? I was trying to protect my family.  I suspected your dad was the Trinity Killer.  I thought I could bring him to justice before he killed again.  I wanted to be a hero.  It was stupid, and selfish.  That's what got Rita killed.  Then my father ruined both our lives.  What happened here, Jonah? What I really think happened? This I want to hear.  My mom probably called him at some point asking for money, making it easy for him to find us.    Did you see your father?   Yeah.  I mean, I heard him before I saw him fighting with my mom at the top of the stairs.  And I came in, and he looked at me.  Then he pushed her down the stairs like he wanted me to see.  Then he started hitting her with my hockey stick, and I grabbed it and fought him off.  He ran.  I went to my mom and Then I went upstairs, and that's when I found Becca.  What a performance.  Jonah, I'm sorry.  You're sorry? For your loss.  Yeah, well, I'm sorry for your loss, too.  Now, is that why you came all the way out here? To tell me that? I just wanted to see how you were holding up.  I'm gonna be OK.  Go back to Miami.  It's over.  I'd say the fun is just beginning.  LT.  The unis took a statement from a woman at St Joseph's.  Says she was chained up for a few days by someone called \"the Professor\".  Was her name Mary Ann or Ginger? No, it's Holly.  One of them kept calling the other \"Professor\".  But I didn't see either of them.  I was blindfolded.  There were two of them? The younger guy is the one who let me go.  I sort of could tell that he was the weaker of the two.  The younger guy said He kept calling me Holly, you're safe.  What did he call you? The whore.  They didn't touch me, except when they chained me.  And the Professor, I think, would jam his knee behind my neck and hold my head, so that I couldn't close my mouth.  And then he would pour this stuff into it.  And the younger guy kept saying that he was sorry, so sorry for doing this to me.  What'd they make you drink? It was cold and it made me puke.  It tasted like metal.  I think it was blood.  There's probably no way to get a sample of that blood, but we should run it all past Dexter.  Jamie said she was watching Harrison for a few days.  Yeah, Dex said he needed a break, so he just took off.  I get that.  Did Jamie mention where he was going? No, but it was part of a larger conversation about a date she has with Louis.    Masuka's intern?   Yeah.  She met him at your party.  Let me get this straight.  The guy who is Masuka's tool all day long is gonna be sexing up your sister? When you get a hold of Dexter, find me.  for the Knights of Columbus Demolition Derby.  Make sure you stop by and give Doc a big hello.  Debra, Debra, Debra.  Is she really worth it, Dexter? What is it with you and her? I feel like I ran over a nail or something.  Let's pull over.  We need to find a base camp, anyway.  This looks good.  And if I can just get your signature right there.  Keep that pen if you want.  That'll be $39.  Please, and thank you.  I saw from your plates that you're from Florida.  Must be happy to get out of there.  From what I see on the news, that Miami is a real sewer.  And now, whatever the hell is going on down there.  Horses running in the streets.    People say the world is ending.    Crazy assholes.  So what brings you to these parts? I'm following the Oregon Trail.  Well, so partial to the great outdoors, what is it you do back in Florida? Landscaping.  Never made any sense to me.  Just hiring someone to do what nature does naturally.  This place would turn anyone into a homicidal maniac.  Can you point me to the nearest garage? I have a flat.  I can patch that for you.    You can do that?   Yeah.  We're pretty handy here.  Unlike us city people.  Can you patch a tyre? No, I cannot.  Well, I'm happy to help.  I'll give you a good deal, too.  How about 20 bucks?   Sign me up.    It's a deal.  Not a callous on that hand, is there? I wear gloves when I work.  About how long do you think? It shouldn't take me more than a while.  Town's not too far if you want to grab a bite.  Just follow the road.  It'll take you directly there.  I'm starving.  You're welcome.  Shortcut? Lead the way.  It's a little pot farm.  Now I see why Shady Norm wanted us to stay on the road.  Shady Norm's been a very industrious little fellow, hasn't he? Come on, let's get out of here.  Let's get lunch.  \"When the whore of Babylon is revealed, \"she is sitting on a scarlet coloured beast \"having seven heads. \" There were some pictures of this beast in Gellar's sketch book.  I blew them up a little.  Looks like a dragon.  Yeah, on paper.  Who knows how they'll bring it to life in the next tableau? Listen to this.  \"The whore, in addition to being arrayed in purple and scarlet, \"will be drunk with the blood of the saints. \" That's why they had Holly drink the blood.  Drunk on the blood of the saints? Were they making her drink their blood? If they considered themselves saints, the creepy fucks.  And why'd the younger guy let her go? Who is he? Probably a former student, right? I mean, he kept referring to Gellar as \"Professor\".  How do we get an ID on him? Well, Gellar taught at Tallahassee for 12 years.  So if they're gonna continue, the best way for us to stop the next murder from happening is to get a name on Gellar's accomplice in a haystack of 2,400 potential suspects? Fuck just isn't enough right now.  Yeah, unless you're talking virgins.  Maybe I could be of some help.  I'll work on it.  I would kill myself, but it would add to my murder total for the month.  At least we're closer to catching him than we were this morning.  Yeah, I feel a lot better.  Where the fuck is Dexter? I promise I won't tell anyone.  Well, how do I know I can trust you? Oh, well, that kiss is a contract, you know.    Come on.    All right.  OK, this is rough.  And it's not even a beta version, but You totally got my brother.  Even down to the way that hat sits on his big head.  Is he like the star of your game? Well, the game is modelled on the department, so if he's the lead on a case, then he's kind of the star.  Yeah.    You're really smart.    I know.  Someone's here.    Debra?   Hi.  Where's Dexter? On a trip.  Where did he go? I don't know.  The Keys? His boat is still docked at the marina.  Well, maybe he took his car.    Have you tried calling him?   About a thousand times.  But not from here.  If you could go somewhere else, where would it be? I've never been to Portland.  That's a little predictable, isn't it? Isn't that where all serial killers go? Home, sweet home.  Don't answer that, Dexter.  Jamie? What's wrong? Where in fucktopia are you? Deb.  Hi.  Did you get my messages? What's that sound? I can barely hear you.  The reception's terrible.  We had a breakthrough on the DDK case.    Deb, I gotta go.    You know, you could have asked me before you just took off.  You offered me some time off.  I meant the afternoon, not five fucking days to go wherever it is that you are! Where are you? It's, I don't know, personal.  I'm your sister.  Then tell my lieutenant that I'll be back as soon as I can.  I'm sorry, you're breaking up.  We don't have much time.  We gotta do Jonah's now.  Let's go.  Goody.  There it is.  1965 Walnut Street.  Home of the family formerly known as the Mitchells.  You want to kill him here or just lie in wait? Neither.  Then what are we doing here? I don't know for sure that he's guilty.  Not this again.  Harry's code.  Tell me why it matters if a person is good or bad.  Does it make you feel better to kill bad people? It's part of the ritual.  You don't need a justification to kill.  The code is more than that.  It's kept me from getting caught.  It's given me a life.  A life that is a big, fat lie.  Just like Jonah's story.  What more proof do you need that Jonah's guilty? The FBI didn't photograph the entire living room.  Maybe Jonah made a rookie mistake.  My knives! I'm guessing it's the motel gimp.  Whoever it is also took my forensic kit.  Now, that I don't miss so much.  It's the Midwest.  Nobody locks their doors.  There's no blood anywhere.  Bleach.  He cleaned up.  Rebecca died in the bathtub upstairs.  I'm bored.  Why aren't we setting up a kill room? This is where Jonah would have had to stand to make it look like his father beat his mother to death.  Try it.  Take a pretend swing.  Not the best clean up job I've ever seen.  Now for the living room.  This is the kitchen.  I'm making a test for bleach, which I wouldn't have to do if my forensic kit hadn't been stolen.  Get the fuck out of my house.  Show me where it happened, Jonah.  Your father killed your mother here, on this staircase? Police can be here in three minutes.  Here is where her body was, and here is where you cleaned up your mother's blood.  You're a sick fuck, you know that? Where'd you fight your father off? It was here, right? When you took the weapon from him and hit him,   chasing him off?   Yeah.    Swinging at him the whole time.    Yeah, I was.  Yeah.  If that were true, there'd be blood here on the wall, and on the ceiling here.  But there's no spatter here.  Hey, that's because I cleaned it up.  Now go!   With bleach?   Yes.  Not on this wall.  Because there was no blood on this wall, because your father was never here.  I know for a fact that Trinity did not kill anyone in this house.  Is that because you killed him? Yes.  Just like you killed your mother and your sister.  Get him.  Satisfied? Let's go set up a kill room.  That's my baby brother.  What about your knives, Dexter? You're gonna need them.  He's in the shed.  Hey, there.  You're real interesting, Florida, you know that? All these potions and solutions in this kit I found in your car.  And these knives of yours.  They ain't exactly landscaping tools now, are they? I'd like them back.  I know you saw what I was growing out there in that cornfield.  You know what's going on here.    I don't care about that.    Really? Then what are you doing here? You obviously have some sort of desk job.  Those hands of yours are so smooth.  You with the DEA, ATF, FBI? Why don't you put the knife down and we can talk? What are they worth to you? I can see you have some money by that fancy car of yours.  It's a rental.  This is not how I was hoping our first kill would be.  I should think knives like those of yours would be worth $10,000 to you.  This guy is leaving you no choice.  He's gonna kill you if you don't kill him first.  So I pay you $10,000, you forget you ever saw me? You can have your knives back.  I'll go find an ATM, but I'm taking these with me.  I found this in your car, too.  $10,000.  Please, and thank you.  Or you're a dead man.  At last, a kill! No lengthy vetting process, no stalking.  One could argue self defence, maybe.  A little too much talking for my taste.  Did you see his eyes? Yes.  Why do you wake up your victims when they're on the table? I want them to know what they've done.  Bullshit! You like to watch the light go out of their eyes.  Doesn't make a bit of difference if they're guilty or not.  How do you feel? Like anything is possible.  This is the life I've always wanted for you.  Where do we go from here? Jonah.  And then what, Dexter? And then we keep going.  But first things first.  How do you dispose of a body when you're miles from an ocean? Norm's a thief, a pot grower and an asshole, any one of which would explain his death.  You can just leave his body out in the open.  I have a better idea.  I hope you took a souvenir.  It's nice to see you, Travis.  I thought you were done with me.  These are your things.  I wanted them out of my apartment.  Would have been a little bit easier if you'd just dumped them in the trash, wouldn't it? I thought bringing them here would give me closure.  Closure.  Sounds like you went from reading the Bible to reading the self help books.  But if you really came here because you secretly wanted me to beg, well then, please, Travis, come back to me.  I didn't come here to have you beg.  How about a story, then? I read one the other day in the paper about a little girl in California who was abducted.  They went into her room, and they grabbed her while she was asleep next to her teddy bear.  They raped her and then they killed her, and then they dumped her into the woods.    Don't tell me   There was another story about someone who set off a bomb in Pennsylvania.  Eleven people were killed, 20 maimed.  That's why the world as it is has to end.  Stop talking.  The sins of humankind continue unless we put a stop to it.  No, no, shut up.  You shut up! Are you gonna kill me? Is that what you want to do, Travis? What I want is to be free.  I'll talk to God.  I release you.  I can go? You know where the door is.  You have no messages.  You're looming.  I came to apologise.  I apologise for being an asshole at your party.  And for sleeping with that professor chick.  And I apologise for proposing to you.  I just thought it was something people did after a while, you know? Like buying a coffee table.    We never bought a coffee table.    Well, we talked about it.  And we couldn't talk about getting married? We did have something good, right? I mean, I'm not crazy, am I? Yeah.  We had something good.  You know, there's times when I come home, and I still expect to see you there.  And then I open up the door, and everything's so neat and clean.  And it hits me all over again.  You're gone.    I'm right here.    Yeah.    In LaGuerta's office.    Fuck, I know, right? It still feels like her office.  I think that's why I haven't unpacked anything.  At all.  Yeah.  I wanted to tell you first about this before anyone.    I made that difficult.    Yeah, but you were hurt because of me.  And for that, I am truly sorry.  I really miss you, Deb.  You, like, kept me glued or something.  Sometimes I don't know what I'm doing.  I feel like the last day my life made any sense was the last day I spent with you.  We can't.  We're over, aren't we? Like \"over\" over.  This is what our life together could have been like if you hadn't have killed me.    Here's the call.    Jonah.  Hello? Dexter, can we talk about this? Sure, Jonah.  Maybe somewhere private.  I was thinking the shop's closed.  I'll meet you there.  Jonah doesn't want to chitchat, you know.  I know.  He has every reason to want to kill me.  I'm the one person who knows what he did.  Don't you just love it when things fall into place? You shouldn't have come to Nebraska.  I had to.  I didn't believe it.  Believe what? That I turned into a killer like my father? Yes.  I thought I set you free.  Set your whole family free.  I wanted to kill him myself.  But you'll settle for killing your mom and your sister? Yeah, and you.  Do it, Dexter! Do it! Kill me! What did you say? Please.    You want me to kill you?   What are you waiting for? Kill me for what I did.  Tell me what happened.  Who cares what happened? I didn't kill Becca.  She killed herself.  I found her like that in the tub, my baby sister.  God, I should have gotten her out of that house sooner.  She couldn't take it any more.    Take what?   Dexter? My mom.  How she just She blamed us for everything he did.  She just She was still in love with him.  She kept defending him.  She just wished he would come and whisk her away to Thailand or Mexico.  Then I found Becca.  And I just I exploded on Mom.  I kept hitting her over and over, just like Dad! I'm my father's son! Time to put him down, Dexter.  You brought me here to provoke a fight, hoping I would kill you.  Death by Dexter.  Fantastic idea! Kill him! What if this were my son? We have come so far.  He's not a monster.  Don't you want to see the light in his eyes go out? No.    Think how good it will feel.    He has a conscience.  And regret.  This is the wishy washy part of you I can't stand.  Biney's mad.  This is like Debra all over again.  You're weak.  I'm stronger than you.  We had a plan, Dexter.  Just you and me.  I'm going home.    Baby brother.    Wait! How am I supposed to live with this? Forgive yourself.  Have you been a good girl, Debra Morgan? Because it's about to be Christmas.  Show her, Louis.  I created a programme that cross referenced former students of Gellar with people living in a 20 mile radius of Miami.    I excluded a few variables.    And presto!   Two hundred names.    It was that easy?   But not all that legal.    Not a problemo.  Louis Greene is not an employee of Miami Metro, just an unpaid intern.  Thank you.  I think.  Here to serve.  If you want a ride to work, I'm leaving in seven minutes.    Not six?   Not eight.  I'll be ready.  Brother Sam believed light can keep darkness at bay.  But I wonder if darkness is defined by light.  If so, darkness can't exist on its own.  There must, by definition, be light somewhere, waiting to be found.  Welcome home, Son.

With everything.  Oh, please.  God's will doesn't stop just because you want to play house with your sister.  You could have asked me before you just took off.  You offered me some time off.  I meant the afternoon, not five fucking days to go wherever it is that you are.  Kids trust everybody.    For the little one.    Here you go.  They trust the food you're giving them is safe to eat.  This way, buddy.  They trust you to lead the way.  Not the usual today.  Two coffees and What's good for an apology? Male or female?   My sister.    I'd go with a cruller.  OK.  They don't question your motives.  Give a kid a mouthful of sugar and trans fat, and he's your friend for life.  Thanks, Francisco.  Grown ups are a lot harder.  My sister gave me a day off, and I took five.  She has every right to be angry, but I can't tell her that I was in Nebraska.  Or why I was there.  Well, look what the fucking cat dragged in.  The cat also brought coffee and doughnuts.  You have five minutes.  Some of us actually have to show up for work.  I see you're all moved in.  Now it's four minutes.  Right.  I'm sorry I took off like that, I really needed to get away.  I'm sorry about what happened with Brother Sam.  And this whole Trinity thing sucks, I get it.  And you want to blow me off? That's fine, too.  But you put me in a really shitty position at work.    I know.    Everybody thinks I gave you a week off in the middle of this DDK shit storm, which is only slightly better than them knowing that I didn't give you a week off! I know.    I took advantage of you.    Yeah, you did.  I really am sorry.  OK.  You're forgiven.  But it's only because I need you in on this DDK shit.  What's going on? Looks like this chick, Holly Benson, was taken by DDK.  She got chained up, was held hostage but she got away.  How? They dumped her in some parking lot.  What, \"they\"? That's the best part.  Turns out there are two of these end of the world motherfuckers out there.  Gellar and some younger guy.  He's the one that let our vic go.  I think he might be a former student.  Seems like Travis Marshall isn't my secret any more.  Wow.  Two of them.  Why did they let her go? Why did they tie body parts to mannequins? Why did they hang a waitress from a spiked collar in a greenhouse? They're bat shit.  That's why.  But it sounds like Travis is having second thoughts.  OK, I have to go.  I'll fill you in on the rest when we get to the station.  Yeah, I'm going to be a little late.  You have got to be fucking kidding me.  Brother Sam's funeral is this morning.  I feel like I should OK.  Fine, go.  Fucking funerals and doughnuts, you're really good.  Sorry.  Travis? Hey, just in time.  I got an egg white omelette, your favourite kind of veggie bacon and scones in the oven.  I can't believe you did all this.  Yeah, well, you're always doing everything for me.  It's definitely my turn.  Go, sit down.  Just let me get dressed first.  All right, hurry up.  I remember that day.  What are you doing here? You said I was free.  And you are.  But I can't say I'm impressed with what you've done with your freedom.  You traded your place in God's plan for the pathetically mundane.    I like mundane.    Really? Because when we met, you had plenty of it.  Your sister treated you like a child.  You had no friends.  No faith.  Your life was of no consequence, and were you happy?   It's not like that now.    No.  Now you have garden gnomes and Someone's made you breakfast.  Want to see what I've made? It's beautiful, isn't it? All it needs is the right whore.  Travis? I bet she'd look lovely in red.  You stay the fuck away! Are you taking that out? Yeah, I'll just I'll do it later.  Travis, you all right? Yeah, I'm fine.  Hey, do you want to get out of here for a couple of days? We We could go to Disney World.    You mean now?   Yeah.  Right now, let's justgo.  Travis, you know I I can't leave.  I have school.  But maybe in a in a couple of weeks on my break.  That would be fun.  How many people here can say that Brother Sam changed my life? Let us always keep him in our hearts.  \"The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not be in want.  \"He makes me lie down in green pastures, \"he leads me beside quiet waters, \"he restores my soul.  \"He guides me in the paths of righteousness \"for his name's sake.  \"Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, \"I will fear no evil, \"for you are with me.  \"Your rod and your staff, they comfort me.  \"You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies.  \"You anoint my head with oil, my cup overflows.  \"Surely, goodness and love will follow me \"all the days of my life, \"and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever. \"   Thank you for coming.    You're welcome.  Hey, Dexter.  OK.  I have something for you.  Sorry about the blood.  He always had it close by, so when he was shot Last time I saw him, he said he wanted you to have this.  There's probably someone else who would get more use out of it, someone more religious.  I don't know.  Brother Sam used to always say that no matter what the problem is, the answer's in here.  You just have to figure out the question.  Oh, hey.  Have you seen Nick lately? Nick? Yeah, disappeared after Sam passed away.  None of us have seen him.  Maybe he wanted some time alone.  Or maybe I drowned him, right where Brother Sam's ashes are floating.  Is it possible that Brother Sam changed me? I didn't kill Jonah when I had the chance.  Did Sam somehow bring out a little bit of light in me? And did I pass that light on to Travis as well? Is that why he let Holly go? You did the right thing.  I know who you are.  I remember your voice.  I'm not here to hurt you.  You were in my car.  You tried to kill me.  And I let you go.  Just like you let Holly Benson go.  I want to know why.  I didn't want to see her suffer.  You've seen people suffer before? What you said to me made me think.  Think what? That I don't have to do what he says.  I told him I'm done.  I'm not working with him any more.  How did Gellar take it? Not very well.  He's angry.  He won't leave me alone.  Why not just tell the police? I helped him do horrible things.  They'd They'd arrest me.  They'd I am a good person.  I thought we were doing the right thing.  I just I made a mistake getting involved with all of this.  I can help you, Travis.  I can get him out of your life for good.  The police will never know about you.  You just have to help me find him.  Just because I'm not working with him does not mean that I will work with you.  All you have to do is tell me where he is.  I'll take care of the rest.  You don't know who you're dealing with.  Do you have any idea how dangerous he is? He is crazy, I know that now.  He will finish his mission, and he will kill anyone who tries to stop him.  And then what? Assuming the world doesn't end? I don't want to talk about this any more.  Both of you need to just leave me alone.  Travis has a dark passenger all his own, but unlike mine, his walks and talks and breathes and goes by the name Professor Gellar.  And most significantly, his dark passenger can be killed.  Later.  What have we got? Call girl, of the high end variety.  ID says Jessica Morris.  The lobby bar downstairs is a known hangout for working girls.  Not that I would know that for any reason.  Rings and a track mark say it's heroin.  Maid must have wiped everything down before she found her.  No prints anywhere, except hers on the tub.  Looks like she OD'd, then hit her head.  If the drugs didn't kill her, the blow to her skull sure did.  Probably an accidental death, but the ME'll tell us more.  What do you think? Blood coming from her nose Consistent with an overdose.  Yeah, but look at the pattern, sort of a zigzag.  It starts this way, suggesting that she fell in this position.  The blood dries, and then it changes direction, as though her head were turned and then moved back, suggesting the body was lifted and then repositioned.  Heroin overdose kills almost instantly.  Once her heart stopped beating, there should have been hardly any blood flow from the head wound.  Unless Unless someone did chest compressions post mortem.  Broken rib.  Could have been the EMTs.  She was long gone when the maid found her.  The EMTs didn't attempt CPR.  What do you think? I think it happened pretty much like Vince said.  She OD's, hits her head, she dies.  Someone comes in, sees her.  He flips her over, causing more blood to come out of her nose.  Tries CPR, but he cracks her rib cos he's panicked.  And he realises that he's just causing more blood to flow from the head wound, so he stops.  Puts the body back where he found her, then wipes everything clean.  Someone call the Captain over here? No, why? Because she's here.    Captain.    Where's Sergeant Batista? Downstairs.    What do we have here?   Looks like an overdose.  OK, good.  Make sure to copy me on the ME's report.    I'm going downstairs.    Yes, ma'am.  Hey, Dexter.  You're back.    Louis.    Hey.  I heard what you did at that crime scene.  You know, the body was moved and then repositioned.  So cool.  You You gotta show me how you figure that stuff out.  Yeah, sure, we'll do that sometime, but right now, I gotta OK, I'm going to make this quick.  The whole city is freaking out over DDK.  We're getting over 100 calls a day.  People saying that they've seen Gellar, people asking if it's safe to go out at night.  I need everyone's asses on the fucking ball.  I'm going to keep rearranging that sentence to make it hotter.    Holly's experience with DDK   And that's still my sister.  suggests that Gellar is working with an accomplice.  Now, thanks to Louis, we have a list of male Tallahassee graduates Iiving in the Miami area that have taken classes with him.  We have over 200 names to investigate, so I'm going to take some myself.  Batista, Quinn, Mike, you guys can divide up the rest.  And let's not let on that we know Gellar has an accomplice.  This fucker thinks we don't know who he is? Let's keep it that way.  How do I get Travis to trust me before the cops get to his name on the list? I'm sorry I wasn't at the crime scene this morning.  It's fine.  Mike was there.  I got a way to make it up to you.  There's a new place opening on Washington.  Opening night's invitation only.  Guess who's got two of these? I'll pass.  I've got Auri on Friday night.    Auri always cancels on you.    Take Masuka.  Your loss.    Hey, sis.    Hey.  What brings you here? We were just at Harrison's music class, and he wanted to see his daddy.  Come on, admit it.  You wanted to say hi to your big brother.  Hey, I got your text.  Yeah, we were just in the neighbourhood.  Want to maybe go for a walk with us? Yeah, sure.  Let me just tell Mr.  Masuka.  OK.  You're still seeing that guy, huh?   You don't like him?   I don't really know him.  You know what?   You should come to dinner with us.    I don't know If you're going to judge him, then maybe you should have some idea who you're talking about first.  OK, sure.  Why not?   It'll be fun.    Yeah.  Children trust that when we put them to bed at night, they'll live to see another day.  Adults are not always so fortunate.  Travis is my only way to Gellar.  I have to convince him to help me.  Maybe I need to learn to speak his language.  Brother Sam did say all the answers were in here.  I'm not sure he meant the answers to my kind of questions.  What are you doing here? I told you I know, you don't want to get involved.  I understand that, but you are responsible for hurting a lot of people, Travis.  I'm sure you don't feel good about that.  You've wandered from God's path.  I was led astray.  I know, the blood.  Long story.  But what's more important are the words underneath the blood.  It says here, \"Anyone then who knows the good he ought to do\" \"and doesn't do, sins. \" The sin of omission.  James 4:17.  So? So it sounds to me like you're in some trouble, Travis.  If you allow Professor Gellar to continue doing what he's doing, according to James here, it's just as much of a sin as doing the killings yourself.  I know.  I wish that I could take it all back.  But now I can't risk antagonising him.  I can protect you.  It's not me that I'm worried about.  It's my sister.  Gellar's threatened her before, and I can't let anything happen to her.  Can I blame him? As long as Gellar's out there, she's still in danger.    I can protect her.    What if you can't? OK.  I'll try to convince Lisa to go to her friend's up in Pensacola for the weekend.  Gellar won't leave Miami.  Let me get her safe, and then I promise, I'll do whatever you say.  Sam was right about this book.  Hi, can I help you? I'm Lieutenant Debra Morgan, Miami Metro Homicide.  I'm looking for Travis Marshall.  His building manager said that they were forwarding his mail here.  Travis is my brother, but he's not here right now.  Can I Can I help you with something? We're investigating a college professor, James Gellar, in connection with three homicides.  The Doomsday Killer.  Oh, my God.  Travis.  Has something happened? No, we're just looking into former associates of his.  And according to our records, Travis took some classes with him up in Tallahassee.  We just want to ask him a few questions.  I I doubt that Travis would be able to help you much.  I don't think he stays in touch with anyone from school.  He must have been pretty shaken up when he found out an old professor was a murder suspect.  I guess so.  He didn't mention it? Well, Travis isn't really the type to talk about how he feels about things.  Not even to his sister.  So you aren't close? Our parents died when Travis was still a teenager, so I pretty much raised him the rest of the way, so Tragedy makes you tight, you know? But, with Travis, I think it also made him closed off, I guess you would call it.  I don't know why I'm telling you all this.  So you haven't noticed any unusual behaviour?   Nothing out of the ordinary?   No.  Same old Travis.  I actually have to get back to work.  OK, if you could just have him give me a call the next time you see him, so we can check him off our list? OK.  I'm sorry I couldn't have been more help.  No, thank you for your time.  Hey.  So, any luck finding DDK's accomplice? No, not yet, but I crossed five names off the list.  And I'm going to go back out there as soon as I make a couple of phone calls.  Thank you.  Sounds like detective work, Lieutenant.  Well, it's a team effort.  One of these names is going to pan out.  Well, until it does, I've got good news for you.  The ME report came back in on Jessica Morris, the prostitute.  Cause of death was the overdose.  Why is that good news? Because the case can be closed as an accident, which means you have one less homicide to worry about.  Wait, why were you looking at the ME's report on that? Your plate is so full with DDK.  Came across my desk, and I took a look at it.    Team effort, right?   Right.  OK, so you can close the case now.    Congratulations.    Thank you.    Hey.    Hey, where are you? I'm on my way back from lunch.  Look, will you do me a favour and put a rush on Jessica Morris' blood report?   LaGuerta's acting weird.   Weird how? She's being helpful.  I just want to see what she's up to.    I'm on it.    Thank you.  Lisa.  Come on.  Hurry up, Lisa.  Stop following me! Sorry, Travis.  We don't have time for your little journey to find yourself.  We have work to do.  You know, when Jamie told me you got the Trans Am, I was jealous.  That is one awesome car.  You drive a VW, right? Yeah, it's a limited edition.  Actually, it's very rare.  I'm going to go to the restroom.  You guys keep talking about car things.  She's amazing.  I can't believe that a girl like that could be interested in a guy like me.  She's interested in a lot of people.  My sister's a really nice girl.  She has a hard time saying no.  So she dates a lot of guys? She's young.  She's in school.  She's not in a place in her life to be taking anybody too seriously.  OK.  I know you seem like a nice guy.  I just wouldn't want to see you get hurt.  So when Jessica Morris OD'd, there was definitely someone in that hotel room with her.  No doubt.  Then why is LaGuerta on my ass to close this thing? Maybe she wants to keep it low profile? So what am I supposed to do? If I do my job and I investigate a possible homicide, then I piss off Captain Close it.  And if I close it, this guy walks.  Maybe you should talk to LaGuerta.  Yeah.  Maybe I should.  Either way, I have to sign this fucking blood report.  Do you have a pen? Here.  Why do you have a pen from the Shady Lane Motel at Kearney, Nebraska? Must have picked it up somewhere.  Yeah, at the Shady Lane Motel in Kearney, Nebraska.    I can explain.    Kearney, Nebraska, is where Trinity's family was murdered.  Which you found out about the day you took your little joyride.  So that is either one motherfucker of a coincidence, or you were \"just driving\" to fucking Nebraska.    OK, yes, I went to Nebraska.    Why? Guess I just felt drawn there.  Did you talk to Jonah? Yes.  Why? I don't know, Deb.  We both lost people we love to the same killer.  I just felt a connection with him, and I needed someone to talk to.  And you couldn't talk to me? I didn't want to burden you.  Burden me, my ass.  I burden you all the time.  It's not a burden for me to be there for you.  It was a mistake.  I shouldn't have gone.  That's not the point.  The point is that you lied to me about it.  The point is that you thought you had to go to buttfuck ville to talk to somebody about Trinity.  Dexter, don't you think I get it? I lost Lundy because of Trinity, too.  Hey, guys, looks like DDK struck again.  Janitor found this early this morning.  The whore of Babylon.  The next tableau.  Shit! I interviewed her yesterday.  Her brother was a a student of Gellar's.  Travis.  Travis Marshall.  Find Travis Marshall right the fuck now, and if you can't find him, put a BOLO out on him.  I think he's Gellar's accomplice.  Travis just shot to the top of Miami Metro Homicide's most wanted list.  Did Travis go back to Gellar, or was this the price Travis paid for defying him? A ripped seam.  \"F. N.  Galway.  \" This used to be some kind of vestment.  A robe, maybe.  What do you think the letters on her forehead mean? We'll find out.  Hey, I got something.  It's your card.  What the fuck? What the fuck do you think that means? Maybe it doesn't mean anything.  These assholes are all about messages.  You think it's because I talked to her?   You think it's to keep her quiet?   This isn't your fault, Deb.  But it could be mine.  Sorry for the chain.  I couldn't risk you disappearing on me.  You know you're far too important.  What do you want? Penance, to cleanse your soul.  It's not your fault, Travis.  The devil comes in many forms.  Sometimes he tempts you with an apple, or fame, or riches, or a mundane life with your family.  Do not talk about my sister.  Your sister whom you hold in such high esteem talked to the police.  She betrayed you.  Just like the whore of Babylon.  What did you do to my sister? No.  No! She's part of it now.  Don't you get it, Travis? She was doomed to hell on Earth.  Tribulations.  But now her soul is pure.  She can go to God.  Just like you wanted.  And you can come back to our mission.  I didn't want this! I understand.  It'll take time.  Pray for your sister.  Do whatever it is you need to do.  And when I come back, I sincerely hope you have a change of heart.  I was just on my way up to see you.  I hear DDK has struck again.  We have a BOLO out on Travis Marshall.  Everyone in the city is going to know what he looks like.  Meanwhile, you now have two suspects and no arrests.  Yes, I know.  Actually, I was coming to talk to you about Jessica Morris.  The dead prostitute.  Why hasn't that case been closed? Because I saw Dexter's report.  Someone else was in the room.  The woman overdosed, Debra.  What does it matter who else was in the room? Because some dickhead left a dead woman in a bathroom.  Aren't we talking involuntary manslaughter, not to mention solicitation, obstruction?   Hell, we could get murder two.    Stop.  Debra.  I'm going to level with you.  That COMPSTAT hearing did not go very well for either one of us.  Another open case will put our clearance rate at 19%.    But if we let a guilty man   19%, Debra! Do you understand what's happening? We have a city in an all out panic.  Last night, a woman tried to drive her car into Biscayne Bay with her infant son inside, because she thinks it's the end of the world and she didn't want him to go through the tribulations.  Now Don't take this the wrong way, but being young and personable and saying bad words on TV just is not going to cut it right now.  Trust me.  Find the men who killed four innocent people, not some john who bailed on a fucking junkie prostitute who overdosed.  And that's an order, Lieutenant.  OK.    Fine.  I'll close it.    Good.  Yeah, it's me.  It's taken care of.  Yes, I'm sure you have nothing more to worry about.  My search for F. N.  Galway has turned up nothing.  This is the last of them.  And there's not much I can do with intern puppy dog watching my every move.  You know, Google's kind of five minutes ago, right? Try Eliot.  Yeah, it uses a targeted algorithm to aggregate content without getting tripped up by all that sneaky SEO bullshit.  Intern puppy dog has skills.  I'll let you do your thing.  Got the ME's report.  Looks like Lisa Marshall was killed the same way as our fruit vendor and our jogger.  But get this, the ME didn't find any of those paper 1,000 whatever the fuck number things anywhere on the body.  That's because it was Travis who put the numbers there.  That means this kill was all Gellar.  Weird.  Any luck finding Travis Marshall? Not yet.  But I found out he works at the museum, restoring old bibles.  I'll fuck Masuka if this isn't our guy.  Sounds like you're getting close.  Too close.  I'm going to have to work fast if I want to save Travis.  Hey, listen.  You want to grab dinner after work tonight? You know, chat? Talk? Can we do another night? I'm pretty tired, and I just want to spend some downtime at home with Harrison.  OK.  Sure, another night.  Definitely.  I'm sorry I'm late.  I saw the news.  I wasn't sure you'd be able to make our session anyway today.  Yeah, I almost cancelled.  But I don't know.  I could use the break.  That must have been a difficult thing to see.  You could say that.  I mean, I show up, right, to question her about her brother and twenty four hours later I can't help but feel responsible.  You know, I knew that there was something that she wasn't telling me.  Do you think she knew that her brother was involved? I think she knew something was up with him.  And I think she was trying to protect him, which is what a good sister does.  And then he ends up killing her.  Oh, Jesus.  Are all brothers assholes? Who are we talking about now? Who else? Dexter.  So you think he might kill you? No, I don't think he's going to kill me, I just I think he treats me like shit.  He shuts me out.  He won't tell me things, like really important things.  Sounds like you two are having a little trouble communicating lately.  We aren't having trouble communicating.  He's the one that's keeping all the secrets.  But normally, you're pretty open with each other.  Yes.  I tell him everything.  I tell him about boyfriends, work.  I tell him about everything.  Sounds like a lot of talking about yourself.  Aren't you supposed to be on my side? I'm just telling you what I'm hearing.  OK, yeah.  We talk about me.  A lot.  But that's what I'm saying.  I can't get him to tell me shit all about jackshit.  Or maybe he doesn't think there's any room in the relationship for his needs.  Maybe next time you get together you could just make some effort to focus on him and his issues.  Need another round? Next one's on me.  I'm pacing myself.  I need to retain my ability Oh, yeah! to focus.  Sure, I get that.    All right.    Thanks, cutie.  Hey, be honest with me.  I wasn't your first choice to bring here tonight, was I? Not really, but does it matter? Not really.  Hey, excuse me.  Can I get a refill, please? Wait, no, no, no.  Don't go anywhere.  If I said you had a beautiful body, would you hold it against me?   Please.    Come on, it's a song.  I can sing it to you.  Yo, man.  Come on, relax.  Look, just look around, enjoy the scenery.  Look at that right there.  In the green thong.  That's a thing of beauty.  I'm going to marry her.  I'm going to marry Green Thong.  Come on, Quinn.  Sit down.  Will you marry me? No, I mean, of course no one wants to marry me, but can I at least get a kiss from you? Hey, back off, buddy.  All right? We got to cut you off, man, OK? But wait, she's not finished breaking my heart yet.  If you don't take him outta here, I gotta take him out.  OK, no, no, no.  We don't need that.  No problem, we out.  We out, let's go.  Green Thong! I love you, Green Thong.  All right.  Let's get you home, come on.  Nah, man.  I ain't going anywhere.  I'm just getting started.  Louis' search engine turned out to be useful.  Father Nicholas Galway, retired Catholic priest.  You understand that Father Galway's dementia has progressed extensively? It isn't likely he'll remember you.  I'm not sure if that's good or bad.    Father?   Yes? You have a visitor.  Thank you.  Father Galway? Yes, that That's me.  I'm I'm having trouble remembering your name.  Actually, we've never met.    My name is   Francis Connolly! You've come to apologise for breaking the window in the narthex, I take it.  I'm sorry, Father.  I'm in the wrong place.  You're not going anywhere, young man.  You must confess your sins.  Actually, I'm OK.  If I could just \"Bless me, Father, \"for I have sinned. \" My sins? OK.  I've exceeded the speed limit a few times.  Who hasn't done that? What other sins must you confess? I lied to my sister.  The freckle faced one, Mary Grace, isn't that it? She always had a cookie in her hand, that one.  What else? He's too far gone.    I really should get going, Father.    Son! How do you expect to get into heaven, unless you let me absolve you of your sins?   You can do that?   Anything you confess, God will forgive.  I'm waiting, Francis.  I've killed people.  Continue.  A lot of people.  Murder is a mortal sin.  You must Where were we? Confession.  Oh, yes.  Of course.  I absolve you of all of your sins.  In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost.  Amen.  Thank you.  It's sad, isn't it? He was a wonderful priest back in the day.  Yes, he was.  Now half the time, he doesn't know where he is.  Some Sunday mornings he asks to be driven to his church because he thinks he's supposed to lead Mass.  His church?   Santa Maria De Loreto.    Right.    And that's in   It's out in Davie.  But But don't waste your time.  It's been abandoned for over 20 years now.  Not much left of it.  An abandoned church.  Very sad, huh? If Gellar's at that church, his hideout will make an even better kill room.  I'll say good night to Harrison, and then I'll be on my way.  Hey, Dex.  Deb said I could take off since she's here.    I told you tonight wasn't good.    I know.  But you got to eat, right? So you can just relax and kick back.  I'm making steaks.  Which is a big deal, because I can't remember the last time I cooked something that didn't involve pierce film with fork.  Something came up.  I have to go out.  I just came to say good night to Harrison.  I'm sorry for the mix up, Jamie.  Oh, that's OK.  I can stay.    Daddy.    Something came up? What the fuck do you mean, something came up? Would you please watch your language in front of him? I'll go give him his bath.    Night, buddy.    Night night.  So when you said you wanted a quiet night at home, you were just blowing me off.  I told you, something came up.  You're not going to tell me what it is? I can't talk about it right now.  You can't talk about it, or you can't talk about it with me? Deb, this isn't the time.  I gotta go.  Do you know why I came over here tonight? It was for you, asshole.    So you could talk to me.    Talk about what? About whatever stuff you drove to Nebraska to talk about.  Deb, please just let this go.  I am just trying to have a conversation with you.  Is that so fucking hard? Deb Fine.  I don't want to hurt you, Travis.  I think you do.  I think you like watching people suffer.  There's only one way to get the demons out of your head.  Who's out there? Don't you say a word.  Did Gellar do this to you? He killed my sister.  Where is he? Travis, is he here? Damn it.  Gellar has seen me now.  This just got much harder.  I'll help you.  I'll help you kill him.  I've gotten Travis to trust me.  In my own way, I'm going to eliminate a small bit of darkness and let some light in.      Previous EpisodeNext Episode"

        "script": "Previously on Dexter You're saying Gellar does the killing? He's so much stronger than me.  I can protect you.  It's not me that I'm worried about.  It's my sister.  Your sister talked to the police.  She betrayed you.  Just like the whore of Babylon.  No! Ice Truck Killer? It was stolen from our evidence room.  I erased any trace of the sale from the internet.  However, I wasn't able to get the hand back.  So when Jessica Morris OD'd, there was definitely someone in that hotel room with her.  No doubt.  Then why is LaGuerta on my ass to close this thing? My sister's a really nice girl.  You seem like a nice guy.  I just wouldn't want to see you get hurt.  Travis, is he here? Gellar has seen me now.  This just got much harder.  I'll help you.  I'll help you kill him.  I've had my dark passenger for so long that I can't really recall life without it.  Like someone who's grown up with a club foot, or a stutter, or a lazy eye, it's simply been my own affliction that I accept as part of who I am.  But for Travis, his dark passenger is a more recent acquisition, and he's not adjusting so well.  So I'm going to help separate them.  You saved my life.  Gellar would have killed me.  You said you'd help me find him.  Where is he? Travis.  I don't know.  Where else does he stay? Nowhere.  This place was his home.  The only time he left was when we were doing the work.  You mean hunting your victims.  This one.  The bowls of wrath.  The next tableau.    Where will Gellar stage it?   I don't know.  Then who will Gellar's next victim be? I don't know.  He murdered your sister, Travis.  Think.  Gellar was the one who made all the decisions.  Come on, Travis.  You must know something.  \"2LOT. \" Is that from the bible? I've never seen that before.  Look for anything that'll help us find Gellar.  I feel dizzy.  We need to take care of that arm, and find you a place to stay where Gellar can't find you.  What's this about, Dexter? It's what Brother Sam would want.  Are you sure this is about Brother Sam? I know what I'm doing.  My cell phone's on the speed dial.  Sit down.  Hold out your arm.  So what am I supposed to do here? Nothing.  There's nothing you can do right now.  Not to mention you're wanted for multiple murders.  You can't help me if you're in jail.  I'll be back later with some food.  In the meantime, do not leave this room.  And try to think of anything that might help me figure out where Gellar is.  \"2LoT: The Second Law of Thermodynamics.  \"Tendency for order to become disorder or chaos. \" What does it have to do with the bowls of wrath? A parking pass.  You visited the Miami South Campus.  Were you stalking your next victim? \"Professor Casey's controversial book 2LOT's Tales \"claims to demolish every argument offered \"for a God centred universe. \" If Gellar wants to pour out his wrath, who better to receive it than \"Tireless crusader for the virtues of atheism. \" Dexter's allowed to have a private life, but is it too much to ask for a little give and take? Would you say that your brother has always been guarded? Well, yeah, that's the problem.  But if he's always been this way, why would you suddenly expect him to change? I don't know.  Would you expect a chair to suddenly become a table? No, but   No, because a chair   Is a chair.  Dexter is who he is.  You're good.  How does it make you feel when he shuts you out? Alone.  Where do you think this comes from? This feeling of being alone? I don't know.  My mom died when I was a teenager.  That must have been hard.  Becoming a woman with with no mother figure.  It would have helped if my dad had paid me any attention.  That's probably why I fell in love with someone twice my age.  He was shot in front of me.  Did I mention that? No.  I was probably looking for someone safer after being engaged to this really great guy that also turned out to be a serial killer.  Would you like it if we started seeing each other more than once a week? Deb.  Listen, I'm sorry about last night.  You don't have to apologise.    I don't?   Nope.  I get it.  You're a chair.  I'm a what? I don't have time to explain it.  I'm late for the briefing.  You look confused.  Your sister ever say anything that makes absolutely no sense whatsoever?   All the time.    She ever call you a chair? I don't think so.  Hey, have either one of you seen Quinn? I hope he's OK.  Why wouldn't he be? He got shit faced last night and started proposing to strippers.  OK, let's get started.    Where's Quinn?   He's on his way.  Lisa Marshall is DDK's latest victim.  The whore of Babylon.  Where are we on finding her brother Travis? He's gone missing.  Hasn't reported to work in days.  We got unis at his apartment and at Lisa's house.  So far, nothing.  So he and Gellar either got the fuck out of Dodge or they're holed up somewhere planning their next installment of what the fuck.  Travis is holed up waiting for me.  They have three tableaus to complete.  Now, according to Gellar's notebooks, the bowls of wrath are next.  Now religious experts that I've consulted say that it's punishment poured on the people.  Each bowl is a plague.  Disease, darkness The ocean turns to blood.  You know this shit? I've been studying.  Gellar updated his blog.  It's the first post since the killings began.    Which is huge, right?   Let me see it.  \"In six days, the end will be marked with a solar eclipse.  \"All those following false prophets are doomed. \" Could be Professor Casey.  Or me.  I'm the one Gellar saw in the church.  Look at all the comments.  People are taking this shit seriously.  Professor Gellar, I support your quest.  I'm inspired by your courage and faithfully follow you to the end.  \"Doomsday_Adam.  \" Well, a blog update's not gonna help us find their location.  Well, I could take a stab at tracking down the blog's Internet Protocol address.  I hope you're not as good as you think.  Do it, Louis.  I don't want to know how you do it, but do it.  We're running on fumes here.  I need people following all leads, whatever it takes to catch these assholes, OK? Let's do it.  I hate to root against my own team, but I want a shot at Gellar first.  All right! Jesus Christ.  You missed the morning briefing.  Hey, I overslept.  It happens.  Yeah, well, it's happening a lot.  Get dressed.  Your gun, where is it?   Oh, fuck me.    You got to be kidding me.  The whole city is looking to us to fix this DDK shit, and you lose your gun? I went to the strip club with Masuka, he bailed on me And then me and this stripper went to her car, and she You banged a stripper in her car? Maybe my gun fell out in her back seat.  You better pray that it did and that it's still there.  Please, tell me you at least got her number.    Oh, fuck me.    Dios m\u00edo.  I got enough to babysit with my kid sister.  Your phone's got GPS.  Track it.  That address is halfway across town.  We just lost a whole morning because of your dumb ass.  I'll make it up to you.  Mr Morris.  Yes.  I'm Jessica Morris' father.  Thank you for seeing me.  I am sorry for your loss.  How can I help you? I'd like you to reopen Jessica's case.  Mr Morris, I know this must be very difficult, but the medical examiner ruled that your daughter's death was an accidental overdose, not a homicide.  Yes, I know.  But her sternum was cracked.  And the paramedics said they never performed CPR because she was already dead when they arrived.    How do you know that?   Does it matter? If someone was with her when she died, why aren't you looking into that? I'm sorry, but the case is closed.  Well, then reopen it.  What if that person killed her and then tried to cover it up? I am sorry, but my hands are tied.  Please, just listen.  I don't know if you have kids, but I hope you never have to see them turning tricks on Collins Avenue.  I will run it upstairs.  I'll see what I can do.  Thank you.  Thank you.  How is your magic working? This is a tough nut, but I want to prove Sergeant Batista wrong.  I can do this.  I can do this.  What's his problem with you? He doesn't think I'm good enough to date his sister, so I backed off.  OK.  Stop with the fingers.  We gotta talk.  Look, I I understand the whole cowardly geek response.    I'm not a geek.    One bridge at a time, Louis.  You're into Jamie, right? Yeah, she's amazing.  Well, you have to tell her that.  When it comes to matters of the heart, always follow your dick.  Yeah, but how am I ever gonna win over Batista? You don't.  If Jamie's into you as much as you're into her, she's gonna take care of Batista for you.  Just don't tell him I told you so.  Yeah, I wanted to talk to Dr Casey about this D he gave me.  When's his class again? Brunner Hall of Science.  Got it.  I'll catch him after class.  I brought you a sandwich.  Did you find Gellar? No.  But he updated his blog.  He did? You have any idea what this means? \"All those following false prophets are doomed. \" It's a message for me.  He's offering me a way back in.  And I'm the false prophet.  You ever heard of this guy? Trent Casey? Yes.  Gellar hates him.  He's an atheist.  Does he hate him enough to want to kill him? The painting of the bowls of wrath in the church had \"2LOT\" written on it.    You think he's the next victim.    Yes.  How do we find him? I'll let you know.  Oh, man! All right, boys and girls, time for a snack.    I want one.    Good job.  Time for a snack.  Is this your penance, too? What? Catering for the toddler horde.  My wife's in a meeting.  What's your excuse? I'm here for my son.  Harrison.    Cookie.    Cookie.  Thank you, Harrison.  That one's mine.  Hey.  How are you? OK.  How are you? This is a little awkward, but I think I left something in your car.  Sorry.  I don't have a car.  Didn't I meet you last night out at Virginia Gardens? Oh, you're looking for my mom.  Mom.  Hotness like that's got to run in the family, right? I mean, she must be like Holy shit.  Hi.  We got the wrong house.    Joey.    Hey.  OK.  So you two met at the club? Oh, no, no.  We met across the street at the Waffle House.  I work the late shift, and this one was all hands.  I'd love to hear more, but Joey and I have to get back to the station, and we think he may have left some things in your car.  It wasn't his innocence, if you know what I mean.  It's unlocked.  Thank you, ma'am.  You can't tell anybody about this.  I can say anything I want.  Got it.  Oh, my God.  We took pictures.  I hope you at least wore Oh, no, no, no.  Oh, great.  Fucking great.  Shit.  Just call the station.  Have them send a tow.  The station doesn't know that we're down here getting your gun back, and we got to keep it that way.  Or that you're driving a car the '70s wants back.  Stow it, will you? I wouldn't have to be racing back if it weren't for you.  I could have handled this on my own.  You can't handle your balls right now.  When are you gonna grow up? Like you're one to talk.  Come again? All you want to do is try and control everything and everyone around you in order to feel better about your own fucked up life.  You're so full of shit.  Yeah, really? Cos your first wife up and left you.  Your second wife, she was your wife for what? Six months? You got a daughter that wants nothing to do with you.  I think you need to shut up.  And now your panties are in a big wet wad.  Why? Because your little sister's dating someone you don't like.  Am I right, Lieutenant? Oh, wait, no, my bad.  I'm sorry.  You're still sergeant, cos you fucked that up, too.  Come on, is that all you got, you motherfucker? Little motherfucker.  Hey! Leave him alone or I'll call the police.  Now, creationists say the second law of thermodynamics doesn't allow order to arise from disorder.  So Why does this idea make their bible clutching fingers twitch with excitement? Because for creationists, it means that the idea of evolution, life arising from chaos, contradicts the second law.  It can't happen.  Can I look at your syllabus? I forgot mine.  And you need God to explain everything, right? Wrong.  He's kind of a self important asshole, but I like him.  Casey's office is in Scarnes Hall and he has late office hours tonight.  In case Gellar decides to show up, I'll be here as well.  This coming from people who think there are no unicorns because they were late getting to Noah's Ark.  All right, that's all for today.  Read chapters 9 through 10 for next week.  Thank you.    Professor Casey.    Yes? I believe you're in danger.  What variety of lunatic might you be? I'm only trying to warn you.  Well, then you're one of the good ones.  Do you have any idea how many threats I get each week?   This one is real.    Please.  Unless you have some proof One elevator and one set of stairs equals two exits.  Finally, some use for Travis.  Nice place.  Thank Gellar.  He found it.  So this is where it all started.  And where it's going to end.  This has become very important to you, killing Travis's dark passenger.  Yes.  I would have done anything for a chance to get rid of yours.  I'm not sure you even tried.  You just refocused it.  So what will you do with him once Gellar's gone? Allow him to start over.  I know of a few people who aren't using their identities.  Your slides.  I kill Gellar, and Travis gets a second chance.  The one I'll never have.  What is Gellar like? First year of college, I took his class, and he took me under his wing.  Made me feel like I was part of something important.  And I know it sounds crazy, but he convinced me that God had chosen us to become the two witnesses.  And what do the two witnesses do? They enact the Book of Revelation and bring about the new world.  By ending this one? Why would you want to do that? Have you ever wanted to wipe everything clean and start your whole life all over again? Once Gellar's gone, you can start again.  There's Gellar.  Let's go.  I'm gonna take the elevator.  If Gellar took the stairs, maybe I can head him off.  Watch the stairs, make sure he doesn't double back on me.  Stay here.  Gellar doesn't have much of a head start.  He knows I'm here.  Come on.  Gellar.  Sorry.  You told me not to move.    Did you see Gellar?   No.  Stay behind me.  This is all my fault.  Travis is proving to be my penance.  There's not that much blood.  Casey could still be alive.  Let's go.  I can't believe we lost him.  And Casey, he's gonna kill him.  We can still stop him.  How? Through you.  This blog that Gellar writes, it's important to him.  Send a message to him.  Tell him you've changed your mind and you need to see him.  I'll do it right now.  Just keep sending messages.  Call me as soon as he responds.  Travis posted as the prodigal son, asking if it's OK for him to make his way back home.  No response from Gellar.  Hey, good morning.  Someone helping you fight crime? All wiggles present and accounted for.  Excellent.  Morgan.  DDK struck again at Miami South Campus.  Casey.  I'm on my way.  Casey's lecture hall.  Of course.  Gellar laid him out where he preaches his godless doctrine to the young and impressionable.  This is Professor Trent Casey.  He's an evolutionary biologist and a noted atheist.  Check it out.  The abdomen's got an alpha omega carved into it.    Similar to the fruit vendor.    Only this guy's missing stitches.  And a hand.  That's new.  The puckering on the wrist tissue indicates the hand was removed post mortem.  And judging from his pallor, all his blood's been drained.  Looks like he was strung up and bled out.  Gellar took another page from my brother Brian's playbook.  The stomach cavity's been hollowed out.  Any bets on the prize that DDK left inside? Unis swept the room.  They didn't find any tripwires or blood.  So if this is the bowls of wrath, then what, is it gonna show up in a bowl somewhere? Open him up.  Brace yourselves for awful.  He's empty.  So, then, where are the bowls of wrath? Let's get him to the ME's office.  Somebody get a gurney.  I got it.  Quinn's right.  If each bowl is a plague that God poured No, don't! Oh, my God! What the fuck? Gellar hasn't seen wrath until he's seen mine.  Are you serious? Bowls of blood dropped on my head? It's like a perfect fucking metaphor for my entire fucking life.  I'm not even sure I believe in God, but I'm pretty sure he hates me.  Losing your parents is difficult.  Having a loved one shot in front of you is unthinkable.  Finding out that your fianc\u008e is a serial killer Did I mention that he was Dexter's biological brother? No, you did not.  So wait a minute.  The Ice Truck Killer was your brother? No.  Dexter was adopted, so we're not blood related.  What? What does that \"oh\" mean? You mentioned that your father didn't pay much attention to you.  What was his relationship with Dexter like? They did everything together.  And without your mother I was left behind.  You can move forward, Debra.  But it's gonna mean taking responsibility for your feelings and your choices.  What does that mean? Please don't misunderstand me.  I am very sensitive to the trauma and the tragedy that you've experienced.  But as far as your failed relationships are concerned What? We are responsible for the partners we choose.  Bullshit.  How the fuck was I supposed to know that Rudy was the Ice Truck Killer? Are you saying that I chose to be with a serial killer on purpose? I think you have a history of choosing inappropriate or unavailable men.  Well, what the fuck do you want me to say? That my life is a train wreck of a disaster? That my life is a shithole? Well, I already know this.  This isn't news to me, OK? I know that I am broken.  Do you know that you don't have to be? You can pick up the pieces.    How?   By making different choices.  By breaking your patterns.  Debra, it's gonna be hard.  But you can make yourself whole again.  You can.  I heard about the bloodbath at the crime scene.  You OK? I'm fine.  I was actually coming down to talk to you about your request   to open the dead call girl's case.    And? You can't afford to put an unsolved back on your plate.  Jesus fuck.  Are we really gonna do this again? Careful, Lieutenant.  I'm just gonna stop you right here, OK?   Excuse me?   We've been through this.  You're gonna say it's not happening and that I better do what you say cos you're gonna give me some scary, squinty eyed look, but I am so fucking sick of having this conversation.  So I'm just gonna break the pattern right now.  If you have a problem with me investigating a potential homicide, which is my job, then fire me.  Otherwise, I am reopening the case.  Morgan won't let the call girl's death go.  God damn it.  I could have pressed harder, but she'd only be more suspicious.  You know, it wasn't until I did CPR that I saw the drugs and realised she OD'd.  Maria, I swear to God, I did all I could.  Your career would have been over if you'd stayed.  What the fuck is Morgan thinking? Doesn't she know when to back off? Well, isn't that tenacity the reason you promoted her in the first place? Against my advice, of course.    We have to stop her.    Don't worry.  Hello? The police found Casey's body.  The bowls of wrath.  He's done it.  The body was missing a hand.  Any idea why Gellar took it? The writing is on the wall.  What? The expression.  It's from the bible.  The fingers of a human hand appeared and wrote out, \"Your days are numbered. \" Gellar's sending another message.  What's the message? I don't know.  But it doesn't matter.  Gellar contacted me through his blog.  He wants me to meet him at the church tonight.  Stay in the motel.  I'll pick you up later.  You have the bowls of wrath blood work? Yeah, just finished.  Good news.  The blood was pathogen free.  So the shot I got was just for fun? Are you OK? Yeah, I just threw away a pair of shoes because they're full of blood, but I'm great.  Cos I'm here if you need a chair.  What? What you said before.  I'm a chair.  Yeah, but I don't want a chair.  I want a table.    What are you even saying?   Never mind.  Are we OK? I have no idea if you are.  I'm sure not, but I'm working on it.  Louis Greene is the man.  Easy with the bromance.  You're gonna pitch a tent.  Well, just remember that I discovered him when I'm up for review.  What'd he do? Unscrambled the IPA of Gellar's blogs and tracked it to an address.  Anderson, grab your gear.  Right behind you.  Yeah, that's my IP address, but it's unsecured, so I couldn't tell you who all uses the signal.  What's the signal's range? Give or take 500 feet.  Well, you're putting out I'm guessing it's probably closer to 900 feet.  These guys ever come in here? I wouldn't know, but I can keep an eye out if you want.    Yeah, we'd appreciate that.    You bet.  You know, your guys could drive up anytime, use their laptop, and never even get out of the car.    Up to 900 feet?   Give or take.  Further if there's an antenna within range.  What would that do? Boost the signal by a couple of miles.  What are you thinking? I want to bring in some unis, have them fan out, canvass the surrounding area, see what they come up with.  Louis, I'd buy you a beer, but it has been a long day.  Well, thanks.  I have plans anyway.  Wow! People love their games.    There's a lot of money in it.    Yeah.  I guess.  You have quite the collection of collections.  Yeah, I don't I don't let a lot of people in here.  It's kind of obvious I'm overcompensating for something.  I've been known to collect.  Yeah? I went through an '80s phase in high school.  I had a zillion of those black rubber bracelets.  Wore them like body armour.    So   So weird, I understand.  But why did you blow me off? I was I was trying to be respectful of Sergeant Batista, AKA your brother, who happens to carry a very large gun, by the way.  He sort of gently suggested that I back off.  He scared you.  Does it make me a pussy if I say yes? It makes you honest.  There's another door along that side at the west narthex, and a door at the very end, just off the sacristy.  But you always go in the main entrance?   We both do.    Then go in that way.  And then what? Just talk to him, tell him you made a mistake, that you're sorry.  Keep him engaged.    And what will you do?   I'll go in the back way.  And then? It's better you don't know.  You don't trust me.    Oh, it's not that.    No, I understand.  Gellar's too smart.  I'd just give it away.  Just do what you have to do.  I will.  Hello, Travis.  Professor Gellar.  I'm kind of surprised you haven't burst into flames.  God is very kind.  God doesn't want to hurt me.  Don't fucking tell me what God wants or doesn't want.  You have no idea.  You're wrong.  I don't believe in a God of violence Then go read your bible.  Because God promises that the devious tongue will be cut out, and he will tear you limb from limb and destroy thee forever.  Repent your sins, Travis, or you will burn for all eternity.  I have only tried to do what I thought was right, what I thought No! God has given you so many chances, and you disappoint him time after time.  But he loves you.  He truly loves you.  He's gonna give you one more chance.  And all you have to do is listen to me.  Come to me.  You've got a lot riding on this second chance for Travis.  It's up to him what he does with his life once I'm done with Gellar.  What about your life? My life? Dexter, the police are closing in on Gellar.  You're taking a risk here.  This isn't just about Travis.  You're not that unselfish.  I'm more than you ever thought I'd be.  So if you remove Travis's dark passenger, what are you getting out of this? Maybe I can learn to control my own.  Maybe I can be better.  A better what? A better person? I don't care about being a better person.  It's too late for that.  Then what do you care about? A better father to my son.  Is that so surprising to you? I want to be a better father for Harrison.  I have work to do.  Travis.  He's still breathing.  Travis.  Where is Gellar? Gellar.  He's been dead all along.  Did Travis act alone? Did Travis kill all those people?       Previous EpisodeNext Episode"

        "script": "Previously on Dexter James Gellar.  The professor, from the University of Tallahassee? Gellar disappeared three years ago after he got fired.  You can't get in touch with him, because he went underground.  You're saying Gellar does the killing? He's so much stronger than me.  Gellar is pulling you toward the darkness, Travis, not the light.  What you said to me   made me think.    Think what? That I don't have to do what he says.  You're free.  So when Jessica Morris OD'd, there was definitely someone in that hotel room with her.  No doubt.  Then why is LaGuerta on my ass to close this thing? Oh, my God! What the fuck? Gellar hasn't seen wrath until he's seen mine.  Travis.  Gellar.  He's been dead all along.  Travis acted alone.  He killed all those people.  Travis is the only Doomsday Killer, and I've made a terrible mistake.  Same kill wound as the other victims, which means Travis, you killed Gellar? Professor Gellar.  It is not true.  I did not kill you.  No! No.  You did, Travis.  It's time you faced the truth about yourself.  He thinks Gellar is still alive.  Talking to someone who isn't there, huh? I remember, I came to your office.  I brought you the John the Revelator sword.  Yeah, you'd stolen it.  University blamed me, and they fired me.  I told you we needed it because we are the two witnesses from Revelation 1 1.  And I told you, you were delusional and needed help.  I convinced you, I made you see that we are the chosen ones.  I proved it to you that you couldn't be hurt.  You stabbed me with the sword three years ago.  And it couldn't pierce your flesh.  No.  I didn't do that.  You killed me, Travis, and then you stuck me in the freezer.  That didn't happen.  It was him, the false prophet.  He killed you.  He's trying to stop what God has commanded us to do! And I will carry on without you.  I will finish what we started.  You were wrong, old man.  I'm in control now.  I will make new disciples that will help me.  I don't need you any more.  Travis! I have to stop him.  What happened to saving him? Travis' dark passenger is a part of him.  He can't be saved from it any more than I can from mine.  I should've never listened to Brother Sam.  He was right about one thing.  If you put your faith in the wrong thing It can really fuck you up.  It was a mistake to put my faith in Travis.  From now on, I'm only putting my faith in myself.  It's Deb.  The cops are canvassing a one mile radius around the IP address from Gellar's blog.  They're closing in.  Maybe it's time to let this one go.  No.  The only way to kill a dark passenger is to take out the driver.  After everything Travis put me through, he's mine.  What are you doing? If the cops find Gellar, they'll focus the hunt on Travis, it'll make it that much harder for me to get to him.  I have to keep Gellar alive.  This is ghoulish, even for you.  Well, if the cops found only Travis' prints, they'd get suspicious.  This way, they'll find Gellar's fingerprints, too.  Once I'm done here, I just have to strike the kill room, dump Gellar's body in the swamp and head to Travis' motel.  You really think he's there? No, but it might help me get in touch with him.  What about that? Well, it's helped me once.  Maybe I could use it again.  I'll stash it in the morgue for a rainy day.  Gellar's blog.  You mean Travis' blog.  And now that I have Travis' laptop, I can post as Gellar, too.  Batting the beehive? You sure that's a good idea?   Travis is unstable.    I need him to engage.  This should get his attention.  I'll do anything for you, Dr Gellar.  It's cool what you're doing, killing all those people.  That's creepy.  Hey, Gellar.  It's the end times, huh? Time for God's wrath? Well, I got some God's wrath Right here! Oh, yeah! End times! God's wrath.  Dr Gellar, I've read all your stuff.  But I felt like you were just cracking the surface.  Glad to see you man up, take the next step.  People are always being killed in the bible, but I'm with you till the end of days.  Doomsday Killers in an abandoned church.  It's too fucking perfect.  Holy fucking shit.  Is this it? Are these Gellar's paintings? It looks that way.  And this has to be where Gellar and Travis prepared their tableaus.  And held their victims.  Holy Christ on a stick.  Sorry.  Deb.  You OK? I'm fine.  I just need to I gotta get some air.  What? What? Yeah.  Yeah, I'll be there.  Fuck! The cops may have found his hideout, but that won't stop Travis.  That's up to me.  I can't wait for him to respond to the blog.  I have to figure out his next kill.  Dex, thank God you're here.  You OK? You look kind of sweaty.  I was fine until I went into the church, and all of a sudden my heart started racing and I couldn't breathe.  What the fuck? I've been to a million crime scenes.  You remember that Ice Truck Killer crime scene, when he filled the motel room with blood? Yeah.  I had a panic attack.  Is that what this is? A panic attack? I don't know.  Maybe.  Well, what was yours about? Reminded me of when my mom died.  Right.  Fuck, obviously.  I'm sorry.  It's OK.  But that makes sense, you freaking out about your mom.  Me, panicking at a crime scene? I'm the fucking lieutenant, for Christ's sake.  I can't get all woozy every time I go to a crime scene.  Maybe you're pregnant.  First of all, fuck you, and second of all, that would be the immaculate fucking conception, since I haven't been with anyone since Quinn.  And lastly, fuck you.  Sounds like you're feeling better.  Let's go.  Travis and Gellar were busy fucking bees, huh? Makes you wonder where God was when they were up to all this.  It was a mistake to think that any of this religious garbage could be an answer to my dark passenger.  There's no solution here, only clues to finding Travis.  The paintings We got the seven headed serpent, the four horsemen, the angel.  Quinn, nice of you to join us.  The whore of Babylon, the bowls of wrath and the sixth one \"Wormwood. \" What the fuck's a wormwood? Perhaps how I find Travis.  It's the next sacrifice.  Something about a star that crashes down to the Earth and poisons mankind.  Mankind? Think this one will be bigger? Well, they used one body for the four horsemen, they're not exactly going for literal.  All right, we need to find the who, the what and the where of this ASAP.  Lieutenant Morgan.  Who are you going to poison, Travis? Hey, Dex, there's blood.  Think these could be from the bowls of wrath? Could be.  Let's test it against the samples we took from the crime scene.  Thank you, sir.  Everything OK? Matthews wants to set up a dinner sometime this week.  Some place fancy.  It sounds like he's inviting you into his inner circle.  Congratulations.  You're big time.  Yeah, right.  Now that I've done my job, I can get on with my work.  That looks promising.  There's some more jars over there.  I'll get it.  \"Travis Marshall.  \" Dr Benjamin Carlson, from Miami.    What have you got?   Just some paint thinner.  What the fuck is chlorpromazine? Hey, Anderson.  OK, I'll get back at you.  Get a line on Dr Benjamin Carlson.    I think Travis was a patient of his.    Got it.  At least I still have Gellar's blog.  The prodigal son has returned.  \"False prophet.  \" He's talking to me.  \"I listened to you once and I made a mistake, but never again.  \"I'm going to fix it.  \" What's his mistake? Was it straying from Gellar and listening to me?   I'm psyched you could do breakfast.    One of the perks of being a nanny.  Two hours off while Harrison's in preschool.  I need a little advice.  I really want to show Dexter my video game.  You know, find out what a real blood spatter analyst thinks of it.  Good idea.  I have never seen the guy make a mistake, like, ever.    So you want to impress him.    Yeah.  I mean, he's He's kind of intense.  Babe, I don't know what he's like at work, but once you've seen him reading Everybody Poops to Harrison, you realise he's a big softie.  Just talk to him.  Lieutenant? I have the personal effects of Jessica Morris.    You asked for them.    Oh, right, fuck.  The dead call girl.  Just put them in my office.  I'll look at it later.  OK.  Still looking into that case.  We've been through this.  I'm just doing my job.  You're not.  That's the problem.  I need to figure out what Travis needs to fix, what exactly is wormwood and who will his victim be? OK, people, big day, so let's get started.  Are you running the briefing? Doomsday is our most important investigation, and the more I help out, the more time you'll have to focus on other cases.  You're the boss.    You OK?   Peachy fucking keen.  So I understand that we found Doomsday's hideout.  Where was it?   In an abandoned church.    Great.  Bring me up to speed.  I found a hidden cellar.  I was sure it was gonna be filled with body parts, but there was just some church crap and an old freezer.  Sorry to disappoint you.  Dexter? Masuka? The place was covered in prints from Travis and Gellar.    What about the blood in the jars?   What jars? We found bloody jars in the trash.  Dex? Same type as Travis', and it matched some of the samples we took from the bowls of wrath.  I was thinking Holly Benson, the girl who escaped.  She thought they made her drink blood.  Maybe it was from those jars.  Holly Benson didn't escape.  Travis let her go because of me.  Anderson, what do you got? Anything else? Could she be the mistake Travis was talking about? The mistake he needs to fix.  Travis is already back on Gellar's path.  Will Holly be his victim in the wormwood tableau? If I find Holly, hopefully I'll find Travis.  Dexter.  Hey! Jamie and I went to your doughnut shop this morning Not now, Louis.  It's It's you.  And you're Doomsday Adam.  It's just I I never imagined Steve Dorsey.  This is such an honour.  It's nice to meet you, too, Steve.  Do you mind if I come in? I'm kind of being hunted.  Oh, right! Yep, please.  Come on in.  Beth, get in here and meet our guest.  Well, I hope he's hungry.  I have snacks.  Oh, my How about that? Travis Marshall.  It's a pleasure to meet you, Beth.  Oh, I know who you are.  I've seen you on the news.  Is Professor Gellar coming, too? No.  Not today.  We were just so confused by by his blog.  He said this was all the devil's errand.  Professor Gellar didn't write that.  It was a false prophet trying to throw a monkey wrench into God's plan.  I knew it.  Well, please sit down.  Sorry I just have Velveeta and crackers.  Steve's been out of work lately and I know how it is.  Sometimes it feels as if God has forgotten us.  But I'm here to tell you that your time has come.  The faithful will be given untold riches in God's new kingdom, if you trust and obey.  We're ready, Mr Marshall.  We'll do whatever you say.  Good.  But first, I need to know that you're fully committed.  Holly Benson's apartment, the victim who would've been.  I can stake the place out, wait and see if Travis shows up.  Aren't you putting a lot of eggs in the Holly basket? I'm trusting my instincts.  Something I should've done a long time ago.  Doesn't look like she's here.  What ifTravis got to her first? There's no signs of a struggle or a break in.  Not an ounce of makeup.  No hairbrush, no toothbrush.  She could've packed a bag, gone out of town.  She still won't be safe.  Travis is determined to find her wherever she is.  Which is why I have to make sure I find her first.  Come on, Holly.  Give me something I can use.  Something else.  Who would she be with? Family? Friends? Boyfriend.  I bet he knows where she is.  Peter Grant.  I'm guessing this is him.  Hi, I'm looking for Peter Grant.  Oh, my dad.  Is he at home? Does it look like I have parental supervision? He's off in Spain.  Or Portugal maybe.  Can you tell me if he knows a woman named Holly Benson? She's my dad's \"sex retary\".  Why? I'm a friend.  Can't seem to get in touch with her.  Yeah, well, no offence, but your friend is a total slam pig.  Right.  Slam pig.  Any idea where I can find her?   I don't know.  The yacht maybe?   Yacht? My dad has this boat that he refuses to get rid of.  Probably some kind of fuck pad.    Where is it?   I don't know.  On the water somewhere.  Thanks.  If you do find her, though, will you give her a message for me? Nice kid.  But if she's right and Holly's out on a boat alone, she's a sitting duck for Travis.  Time to play \"find the fuck pad\".  He's in Spain with his wife.  If he was lying, would he let me crash on his boat while he's away? Who asked you anyway? I got to go.  Hello? Who's there? Hello, whore.  We're going for a little cruise.  What the fuck?   You're a fucking asshole.    I'm an asshole? Doomsday's out there searching for his next victim and you're asleep on the job.    What are you, fucking super cop?   No.  I give a shit.  Maybe you should try it for once, instead of going out drinking every night and coming to work while messed up.    Give it a fucking rest, man.    So what? Your girlfriend broke up with you.  Get over it.  Fuck that.  I'm just being a single guy having fun.    You should try it for once.    Hey.  Any leads on a wormwood victim? We're going over Gellar's and Travis' friends, relatives and acquaintances.  Figure the last two victims were personal.  Good thinking.  Keep at it.  Any luck on the Dr Carlson front? Turns out he passed away a couple years ago, but I got a court order releasing Travis Marshall's psych eval.  Drugs were anti psychotics.  Apparently he had some breaks with reality.  Jesus.  Violent tendencies since childhood, a lack of empathy, master manipulator, delusions of grandeur.  It makes sense.  Fucker wants to end the world.    What's that?   Travis' psych file.  More like psycho file.  The guy was a complete sociopath.  Shit, it says here the shrink thought he killed his parents.  I thought it was a car accident.  Or not.  Apparently Travis attacked his father and grabbed the wheel, turned it right into a tree.  Any signs of parental abuse? It's so weird, his sister seemed so convinced he was a good guy.  Maybe she didn't know.  Anything's possible.  He's been a monster from the start.  He's using Gellar to justify his kills.  A lot of people justify their kills.  You mean me? You justified my kills.  You taught me the code.  I kept you from becoming your brother.  Making me a killer was the best you could do.  You were already gonna be a killer.  I guess we'll never know.  There it is.  The fuck pad.  The Ricochet Rabbit.    Where you going?   I know this marina.  I had a freak out at a crime scene today.  Is that unusual? Yes, that's unusual.  Seen a lot of fucked up shit, and it usually just rolls right off.  But not today.  You know what's even weirder is the stuff that usually fucks me up   didn't even faze me today.    Like what? Like LaGuerta trying to swing her dick around in the briefing room.  I handled that like a champ.  Well, that's fantastic.  So why did I lose my shit when I walked into that church? Did the church have some kind of significance for you? I don't know.  The only time I go to church is to go to a funeral, you know? My mom, my dad, boyfriends, my sister in law.  So you associate church with loss.  I guess.  Whatever.  Doesn't matter.  My brother showed up, he calmed me down.  Dexter? Was it something that he said? I guess.  Not really.  It was more just him being there.  Come to think of it, every time the shit hits the fan, I go to him.  I've even moved in with him a few times.    He's your safe place.    Yeah.  Since we were kids.  I used to have these nightmares, and I would sneak into his room and I'd curl up on the floor.  He wouldn't even know I was there.  Is that weird? I don't know.  Do you think it's weird? Not really.  He's my brother.  I think it's sweet.  What are you gonna do? You mean, what are we going to do? We're going to kill her, Beth.  He's testing our faith.  Like Abraham.  You've got it easy.  He was asked to sacrifice his son.  You just have to pitch in and help kill a whore.  I don't think I can do that.  I understand, Beth.  But you'll be purifying her sins.  Her soul will know paradise because of your strength, your love.  Come on.  Let's show her some love.  Hey, Dexter! Louis got here a little early to pick me up for our date.  You have a date? I was hoping you could stay.  Sorry.  I don't supposed you'd wanna have your date here? We can't.  Louis bought us tickets to go see The Avett Brothers.  Can't go another time? They're only playing tonight.  Hey, Dexter, I was wondering if maybe you could take a look at my game before we go.  I mean, if it's not a bad time.    I should probably put Harrison down.    I got him.  You take it easy.  Looks like you had a long day at work.  Daddy.  So Looks like you have a minute.  Looks like I do.  Awesome.  I'll just I'll bring the game up on my laptop.  So, the game is about homicide.  And I know there's, like, a million video games out there about that.  But the secret to this game is, and I haven't even told Jamie this yet, but in my game, you can be the serial killer.  What? See, you have these character choices.  You can be Dahmer, Jack the Ripper, the Bay Harbour Butcher.  I am the Bay Harbour Butcher.  So, what do you think? I think this is offensive.  Who would choose to be a serial killer? Well, I mean, it's like a vicarious thrill.  \"Vicarious thrill\"? How could you possibly know what it's like to take a life? Why would you even want to? It's a bad idea.  Do something else.  So? I'm not I'm not feeling well.  I think I should go home.  And miss the show? I'm sorry.  I'm not I'm not up to it.  Still need a sitter? This is the spot, but no boat.  Which means Holly is probably on it.  Unfortunately, Travis may be with her.  Only one way to know for sure, check the security camera footage.  I guess we all tell lies about ourselves.  Security video archives.  Travis.  It's got sea tracker and the password is Neptune.  Thank you, Mr Grant.  How can I help you tonight? Yeah, I kind of have a problem.  My girlfriend and I got into a fight and she took off with my boat, and I don't know where she went.  I have the coordinates right here.  I'll notify the police.  Any way around that? Sorry, sir, it's protocol.  I know.  It's just, I don't think my wife would be too thrilled to find out about my girlfriend.  I understand.  She's got a bit of a jump on you.  I've got her location right here.  This is wormwood.  I thought it would be bigger.    So we're ready?   Not yet.  We have to cover our tracks.  Police will find this place.  What difference does it make? The world's ending in four days.  It doesn't It will only end if we complete our work.  That can't happen if we're in jail.  God never said this would be easy.  Jessica Morris.  Guilt trip from beyond the grave.  Sal's flowers.  Sal speaking.  Hi, this is Lieutenant Debra Morgan from Miami Metro Homicide.  I need to know if you recently delivered flowers to a Jessica Morris, sent by someone with the initial \"T\".  Jessica Morris.  Here it is, dozen red, delivered morning of the 18th.  That was the day she died.  Who sent them? Oh, my God.  It was Thomas Matthews.  I'm sorry, did you say Thomas Matthews? What's his phone number? Jesus Christ.  Thank you.  Hey, Deb, what's up? I have a situation.  Can we talk? What is it? Not on the phone.  When are you coming in? Not for a while.  I have some personal stuff to take care of.    Before you get mad   It's OK.    It is?   Yes.  You have your own life to deal with.  It seems to be filled with a fuck load of mysterious personal stuff, but whatever.  Well, thanks for being so understanding.  Well, I'm sorry I wasn't before.  You've got my back when it counts.  I know that.  OK.  By the way, you were right about that whole panic attack thing, so thank you.  I'm gonna get off the phone now so that I can have another one.  I'll see you when you get in, OK? Louis.  You're here early.  I couldn't sleep.  I got a lot on my mind.  I think I found a new lead.  This guy, Doomsday Adam.  He keeps posting on Gellar's blog.  To all of professor Gellar's faithful followers, I can now tell you without a doubt that his prophecies are real.  My wife Beth and I have been chosen to be soldiers in the final battle, and with God's help, we will prove worthy.  This will be our last post.  See you in paradise.  You think maybe Gellar and Travis got to this guy and enlisted his help?   I know it's a long shot, but   It's worth checking out.  You think you could track down Doomsday Adam's real name and address? His name is Steve Dorsey.  Here's his address.  Good work.  I'll call Quinn, go check it out.  At least someone around here appreciates me.  Hey, it's Quinn.  For the fourth fucking time, answer your phone.  I'm not calling again.  Just get here.  Sergeant Batista, Miami Metro Homicide.  Are you Mrs Beth Dorsey?   Yes, that's right.    Is your husband home? No, he's not.  Is there something wrong? I'd like to ask you a few questions if you don't mind.  Are you aware that your husband has been posting on a blog by a Professor Gellar? Gosh, maybe you should talk to him when he gets back.  How about we start with you and we take it from there? Found the fuck pad.  Travis.  Why is he in a hazmat suit? You're too late.  Wormwood can't be stopped.  No! This was supposed to set things right.  So you're telling me that this was all a joke? The videos your husband posted as Doomsday Adam, the whole \"chosen\" thing? My husband has kind of a strange sense of humour.  Yeah, I would say so.  Steve's been out of work lately.  He was hoping the videos might go viral and get him some attention, and I just wanted to be supportive.  Mrs Dorsey, these murders are nothing to be joking around about.  Your husband wasted valuable police time and resources that could've been spent catching the Doomsday Killers.  I am so sorry.  I will talk to Steve, tell him to get those videos down.  This will not happen again.  I'd appreciate that.  If this was all a joke, why do you have all these books by Professor James Gellar? What are we gonna do? He's a cop.  He doesn't enforce God's law, we do.  It's a sign.  \"Miami Metro Homicide. \" That's where God wants us to stage wormwood.  Nothing to tell you what wormwood is going to be.  I don't care what it's gonna be, I wanna know where it's gonna be.  I have to fix this.  Holly.  But this doesn't look like wormwood.  She was stabbed, not poisoned.  You're still too late.  She's already dead.  Travis is gone and you killed the wrong guy.  When you gonna let this go? When I kill Travis.  Are you sure you can make that happen? Isn't that what you taught me to do? I didn't have a choice.  According to you, I don't have one either.  Well, you have a choice to make right now.    Maybe you should call the police.    I told you, I don't call the police.  Travis is mine.  Dexter, don't make this personal.  Methylphosphonyl difluoride? And isopropyl alcohol.  Mix them together, they're lethal.  Poison gas.  This is wormwood.  This could kill who knows how many people.  Dexter, you have to call the police.  Why would I listen to you? I'm only here because of you, now I'm supposed to trust your judgement?   I'll make my own decision.    Dex.  Leave me alone! Brother Sam said it.  Sometimes you have to surrender to something greater than yourself.  The Doomsday Killers are hiding out on a yacht at 1 14 Bleaker Canal Road.  And who's calling, please? I'd rather not leave my name.  Hurry.  They have poison gas.      Previous EpisodeNext Episode"

He recently delivered flowers to a Jessica Morris.    Who sent them?   Thomas Matthews.  Jesus Christ.  Every time the shit hits the fan, I go to him.    Dexter?   Yeah.  He's your safe place.    \"Wormwood. \"   What the fuck's a wormwood? This is wormwood.  I think I found a new lead.  My wife Beth and I have been chosen to be soldiers in the final battle.  I'll call Quinn, go check it out.  You're too late.  Wormwood can't be stopped.  Dexter, you have to call the police.  Hurry.  They have poison gas.  \"Miami Metro Homicide. \" That's where God wants us to stage wormwood.  What are we waiting for? Those guys.  That doesn't look good.  We got an anonymous tip that DDK is using this boat.    Plus, there's poison gas.    Poison gas? I know, right? That's all we need.  Part of me was hoping that this tip was bogus, but the uni that we sent down found a body floating near the boat, so here we are.  All clear! What do you got? Chemical traces of two toxic substances.  Put 'em together, you got something a lot worse.  Poison gas? Release it in the right place, say, a closed environment, like a bus or a building, you could kill a lot of people.  Fuck me.  That's Holly Benson.  That's the girl DDK kidnapped and let go.  Multiple stab wounds Looks like they weren't done with her.  There's more inside.  This is where they were handling the stuff.  From the looks of it, they knew what they were doing.  Wormwood, the next tableau, is supposed to represent a meteor falling to Earth.  And poisoning mankind.    Could this be wormwood, right here?   I doubt it.  These people weren't killed by gas.  This looks like where wormwood is being prepared.  So what's DDK planning to do? Release poison gas on people? We can't just sit on this.  We have to alert Homeland Security.    Should I notify LaGuerta?   Do it.  What's his story? Upper abdominal stab wound.  Looks like it happened right here Bled out, fell to this position.  Expired.  There are fingerprints on the knife.  Travis' fingerprints, since it's the knife Travis used to kill Holly.  Holy shit, Steve Dorsey.  It's Doomsday Adam.    Oh, wow.    What? I found a video blog post by him yesterday.  He was going on about how he'd been chosen to be a soldier in the final battle.    Why didn't you tell anyone?   I did.  I told Sergeant Batista.  He was going to Dorsey's apartment to check it out.  Where is Angel? You don't understand, but you will.  When this is over and the new world begins, you will wish you had faith.  I do have faith.  I believe in God.  Well, then you better start praying to him and fast.  Look at me.  There must be something very special about you, Beth, because it is no accident that you are here.  Out of all the people in the world, God chose you to carry out his will.  God reserves a place for those that sacrifice themselves in his name, and it is a place too beautiful to describe.  And I envy you, because you get to see it before I can.    Now, did you pray?   Oh, yes.  Then we're ready.  Everything is in place.  After I do the switch, how long before it goes off? A couple of seconds to let the chemicals mix.  Now, remember, when you enter the building, you'll see a door with a card reader.  You will take the sergeant's keycard and buzz open the door.  It's the only way to bypass the metal detector.  All right, OK.  I understand.  This is a great day.  It's the beginning of the end.  Yeah? It's me.  I've been calling you for five minutes.  Yeah, I just heard it ring.    Is Batista with you?   No.  Why the fuck not? I figured I'd meet him at the crime scene, OK?   What, he isn't there?   No.  Louis said that he went to Steve Dorsey's to check out a Doomsday suspect.  You're his partner, you should know that.  Yeah, I missed a few calls from him this morning.  Jesus Christ, Quinn! What the fuck's going on, Deb? Doomsday Adam, the guy that he was going to check out, just turned up dead.  OK, I got the address.  I'm turning around.  Send backup.  Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Dispatch, this is Lieutenant Debra Morgan.  I need all available units at 1203 North Gordon for a probable Code 40.  Copy that.  You think Angel ran into Travis? Well, it sure as fuck wasn't Steve Dorsey.  I'm sure he's OK.  If Travis is there, we've gotta catch him before he does God knows what to how many people.    Hello?   It's me.  I made it.    Are you in Homicide yet?   I'm on my way right now.  Remember, it's Lieutenant Morgan that is leading this attack against us.  You must get to her.  I will.  God bless you, Beth.  I'll see you on the other side.  Can I help you? I have information regarding the Doomsday Killer case.  Fill this out, and we'll send an officer out to interview you No! I have to speak to Lieutenant Morgan in person.  Tell her it's wormwood, the next tableau.    \"Wormwood\"?   Tell Lieutenant Morgan that.  Lieutenant Morgan's out in the field right now,   I'm not sure when she'll be   I'll wait.  Take a seat.  I've kept you alive in case we ran into problems.  Everything's going perfectly.  So you don't need me any more.  No.  I'd still like to get that prayer.  Go ahead.  Pray.  Your time is up.  I'm all right.  It's Travis Marshall.  He went out the window.  All units, we got Travis Marshall heading west on foot on McNulty, he's armed.    I'm OK, go after him.    Fuck you.  We have a tentative match on the knife fingerprints.    They're Travis'.    I don't get it.  If Doomsday Adam was working with Travis and Gellar, then why kill him? Maybe he was done with him, and the knife was his severance package.  Tough gig.  Homeland is putting their regional teams on alert, and they're sending agents to the station.  Sounds like they want to take over the case.  Well, it wouldn't fucking surprise me.  It's what the Feds do best.  Morgan.  Angel's OK.    Thank God.  What happened?   Travis Marshall had him.  He took off on foot.  Got a head start, but I got unis setting up a perimeter.  Order up as many men as you need.    Angel?   He's fine.  Did we find Travis? No, he got away, but there's still a chance we might catch him.  At least Angel's OK.  Thank God we got that anonymous tip.  She's right.  If I hadn't brought in the police, Angel would most likely be dead.  You know that dead call girl, Jessica Morris? What about her? I think I know who the john was.    Who?   Matthews.    Matthews?   The fucking Deputy Chief.  I don't know what the fuck to do.  He was one of Dad's best friends, he was practically my mentor.  I can't just bust him.  I owe him more than that.    You want to know my opinion?   Yes! That's why I'm talking to you.  Put this on the backburner until Travis is in custody.  You need to focus on DDK.  I'm having dinner with Matthews tonight.  I can't just sit there and talk about the salad.  OK, so bring it up, but maybe Matthews has a reason for what he did.  Yeah, ass.  No, I mean about leaving the scene.  There are worse secrets you can have, Deb.  I'm just saying, maybe you should keep an open mind.  Yes, I get what you're saying.  The hunt for Travis has hit a wall, but maybe there's a way around it.  Steve Dorsey, a. k. a.  Doomsday Adam, Travis' recently deceased acolyte.  There might be something in your history that can lead me to Travis.  Or lead us to Travis, since anything I find, I'll report to Deb.  Unfortunately, Dorsey has led a squeaky clean life.  Mostly.  He's a potential mass murderer with eight outstanding parking tickets.  Hey, any update? No, nothing yet, but search teams are expanding the perimeter.  Which means Travis Marshall most likely got away.    We don't know that.    I'm not trying to be critical, I'm just trying to get a lay of the land.  Homeland Security will be here within the hour.  They'll need an update, and they've requested all relevant materials on DDK.  Which means Travis probably isn't the only thing I've lost today.  However it shakes out, we'll handle it.    Excuse me, Lieutenant?   What is it? There's a woman here who says she has important information about DDK.  Which is? She insists on speaking to you personally.  She says it has to do with something called wormwood.    Wormwood?   Yeah.  How the fuck would she know about that?   Send her in.    Yes, ma'am.  What did stalkers do before the Internet? Is this wormwood? Thank you, again, for coming.  Get everyone out of here! Evacuate the building! Go! Now! Dex, she's gone.  Let's go.  I'll give you everything you need.  I just need to go check on my brother.  I'll be right back, OK? Homeland Security? Yeah, you were right.  They want everything we have on DDK.  It'll slow us down to a crawl.  Is he all right? I'm fine.  I love you, but I wasn't talking to you.  I mean, he was lucky.  The exposure was very mild.  But this gas attacks the upper respiratory tract.  You could get nosebleeds followed by extreme dizziness, especially after physical exertion.    You need to get to the hospital.    Got it.    You gonna go to the ER?   On my honour.  Stop with the sarcastic bullshit, all right? No bullshit, I will.  Really.  OK.  How did you know that crazy bitch was a threat? Just luck, I guess.  Fuck luck, I'll take you.  Dex, you saved a lot of lives today.  You saved my life.  I'd never let anything happen to you.  Come here.  It's just for a little while, OK? Daddy's gonna miss you every second of those 48 hours.  If Travis can attack Miami Metro, he can find his way to me.  I can't take that risk.  I've always known something could happen to me, but now it's more than my life I have to worry about.  Hey, thanks for coming back.  I knew I shouldn't have left.  Sorry to ruin your date and your weekend.  It's OK.  It's not every day your boss becomes a bona fide hero.  Yeah, well, I'm not feeling too heroic right now.  I'm starting to feel the side effects that that doctor was talking about.  I realised I'm probably not best person to be in charge of this little guy.  Well, it's no problem.  You just get some rest.  I'll keep him out of your hair.  Better idea, I booked you guys a room at The Ritz, in Coconut Grove.  Sweet! Have you picked your animal yet? Must've slipped my mind.  At the pageant, every child is paired with a parent to bring the story of Noah's Ark to life.  I think Harrison's a little scared of the whole thing.  Don't worry, buddy.  Daddy will be there.  I promise.  And you should pick one of the good animals soon, or you'll end up being rats or turtles or something.  King of the beasts.  Something feels right about that.  Travis has one tableau left, who knows how many people he'll try to kill next.  And he might go after Debra again, just like he did with Holly.  So you're changing your plan about working with Miami Metro? Miami Metro has been sidelined by Homeland Security.  It's time for my dark passenger to take the wheel again.  According to the seven keys, the next tableau will be the lake of fire.  \"And Satan, who is the beast, \"was thrown into the lake of fire, which is the second death. \" It says, the beast gathers the kings of the Earth and their armies, to prepare for war against God.  And he's responsible for killing the two witnesses.  Gosh You really should have gone to the ER, Dex.  I don't have time.  I have to find Travis.  You have no leads.  He could be anywhere.  It's time for a Hail Mary.  I'm gonna make Travis come to me.  Maybe it takes a beast to catch a beast.  That's for you.  Pick up an OpenX today, and never You don't need help operating I'm standing outside the Miami Metro headquarters, where earlier today, a local woman, Beth Dorsey, attempted a poison gas assault on the station's Homicide Department.  Channel 9 has learnt no officers were hurt in the brazen attack.  The only casualty was Miss Dorsey.  It's OK.  It's It's OK.  It's gonna be OK.  Her sacrifice will be enough.  It must be what God wanted.  It's up to me now.  My time has come.  I must pass the test.  Half the stuff on here costs more than my rent.  My treat.  For a job well done despite some enormous challenges.  Yeah, it would be a lot easier if Homeland Security wasn't breathing down my neck.  Well, just don't let them become a distraction.  I know only too well how easy it is to get bogged down in your job.  That call girl from the hotel is a perfect example of what I'm talking about.  I think I'm gonna have the duck.  I have to admit, I was a bit puzzled when I heard you were still looking into that.  What kind of wine goes with that? You know, some cases are better left alone Fuck.  I can't do this.    I know you were one of her clients.    Excuse me? Jessica Morris.  I found a card for flowers sent to her the morning that she died, from Thomas Matthews.  Were you the one in her hotel room the night she died? White.  You should order the white wine.  Sir You can talk to me.  You don't know what it's like, Debra.  Since Maggie died I've been alone for a very long time.  I went to the hotel.  We And when I came back into the bedroom, I found her lying on the floor.  I saw the drugs.  I tried to revive her, but she just wouldn't breathe.  She was dead.  And I couldn't change what happened.  So What do you intend to do? I don't know.  Debra, I've known you since the day you were born.  You cried in my arms the night your father died.  I've always looked out for you, and I made you lieutenant, and now I'm the one who needs a favour.  I want to help you, but what do I tell that girl's father? You tell him you found nothing.  She overdosed.  No one needs to know any more.  It's not gonna help anyone.  It'll only hurt me.  I'll call Mr Morris in the morning.  Good.  Jeez.  You sure it's safe to be here? Relax, sidekick.  Hazmat gave brass the all clear.  I think I prefer \"intern\".  Bukkakee, bukkake.  The point is, me as boss needs you in Evidence for the next few days.  We're suffering from a serious case of backlog.  I'm on it.  Whoa, Amazon, 9 o'clock.  OK, everyone, listen up.  This is agent Hubbard from Homeland Security.  They'll be taking over our DDK investigation.  Temporarily.  Until my team and I can assess all known associates of the Dorseys.  So what, we're just supposed to sit on our ass for the next four days until the world ends? You want to take that one? I understand your frustration, but this police station came under a gas attack yesterday.  In the government's eyes, that poses a potential on going terrorist threat.  Steve and Beth Dorsey weren't terrorists.  They were nut jobs following a bigger nut job.  Let me and my team be the judge of that.  I promise, this will go faster if everyone cooperates.  They all hate this.  Can't say that I blame them.  Please make yourself available for interviews.  I'd like to start with Sergeant Batista, since he was the last one in contact with the suspects.  Can I set up in your office? Right this way.  This whole thing's fucking bullshit.  They have one hand tied behind their backs, but I don't.  Not when I have Gellar's.    Hey.    Not a good time, Quinn.  Yeah, I know you got that interview, but this'll just take a sec.  Not now.  Look, I'm so, so sorry.  Look, you saved my life, and for that I will always be grateful.  But this is a job of trust.  And I can't have a partner I can't trust.  You've been talking a lot about your department this morning, but how are you doing since the attack? I'm fine.  Pretty much, I mean I'm worried about Dexter.  He wouldn't go to the hospital.  He keeps saying he's OK.  You must be very proud of him.  He saved everyone's life.  Including mine.  It all happened so fast, you know? If that canister had gone off any sooner Your brother holds a very important place in your life.  He's really all I have.  You think I'm crazy now, I can't even imagine what a fucking mess my life would be without him.  I don't think you're crazy.  Can I get that in writing? From what I do know about you, you feel things very deeply.  Like your bond with Dexter.  Where do you think that stems from? Maybe because he's the only guy in my life that I haven't dumped, or cheated on, or isn't dead.  Is it possible that your feelings for Dexter are the reason that you've chosen men in the past who have been either inappropriate or unavailable? Because they're what? Not Dexter? That's insane.  Is it? He's my brother.  Yet you're not biologically related.    So?   It would be understandable, given the past traumas the two of you have shared, for you to develop complex feelings for him.  Why the fuck are we even talking about this? You mentioned Dexter.  He comes up in these sessions a lot.  Aren't you curious as to why that is? He's a huge part of my life.  That's it.  End of story.  You getting upset? Fuck, yes, I'm becoming upset, because you're making it sound like I want to be with him or something.  Well, do you? Look I love my brother, but I am sure as shit not in love with my brother, if that's what you're getting at.  We're done here.  Travis got everyone's attention by staging his tableaus.  It's time I got his by staging one of my own.  I stashed Gellar's hand in the morgue, now I need it back.  Hey, Dexter! I was looking for you in your lab.  Heading home.  Looks like you got a minute.  Haven't we done this before? I just wanted to thank you for being so honest with me the other day about my video game.  Glad I could help.  You just made me realise that I have spent my whole life on the sidelines, playing make believe games, and now I want to get out there and make my life count for something.    OK, I really should   Yeah, go.  Go.  All right.  I hope you're feeling better.  I have no idea where Travis is hiding or what he's up to.  The lake of fire is his next tableau, but mine doesn't require a name, just the right message.  And the best way to get Travis to pay attention to that message is if it comes from me.  Sorry about this.  The hand is bad.  I've had my tongue in places that smelled better.  It was on ice for three years along with the rest of Gellar.  Decomposition will accelerate faster the longer it's in the sun.  Looks like the cut was made just above the palmar carpal ligament.  What's up with that? Travis will know.    What do we know?   Street cleaner called it in.  I checked security footage.  If Travis and Gellar did this, they were out of view.  Well, Travis worked in the museum, so he would know every inch of the square.    Hey, guys.    What is it? All right, cue the music, hold the applause.  Shoot him.  The hand belongs to Gellar.  What? It's a positive match.  Why the fuck would Gellar cut off his own hand? Well, the cut looks to have been made post mortem.  Gellar's most likely dead.  So student offs professor? Why? Good way to get rid of an accomplice.    I mean, look at Steve Dorsey.    Travis is a psycho.  He may not even be sticking to the Enesserette game plan, cos if this is supposed to be the lake of fire, I don't get it.  Let's have the unis sweep the area, maybe we can turn up Gellar's body.  It might lead us to Travis.  Not likely.  I left Gellar in pieces in the swamp.  Right on time.  My tableau should send Travis right to me.  Now he just needs to know where to go.  if they have any leads at all.  And now we go to Museum Square for this breaking news.  Authorities are still baffled by what appears to be yet another bizarre end of days tableau plaguing the city of Miami.  We warn you, these images are very graphic.  Investigators made a gruesome discovery early this morning in Museum Square.  Blood covered the angel statue in the square's fountain, and also contaminated the fountain's water.  A human hand was found nailed to the angel's chest.  On the forehead, the numbers 666   The beast.   were also written in blood.  Channel 9 has learnt that the hand depicted in these startling images may in fact belong to one of the suspected Doomsday Killers, Professor James Gellar.  No.  No.  No! Mark this day, witness.  The end is not upon the world, it's upon you.  You know who I am.  You know what I am.  The beast is coming for you.  \"Slice of Life.  \" Close the door.    Everything   God damn it, Debra.  I thought we had an understanding.    I'm a little confused here.    Don't get cute.  Chief Lane has somehow come to learn about my indiscretions.  He's asking me to retire! Is this how you repay me after all I've done for you? I was at a crime scene all day.  I haven't talked to anyone.  It doesn't matter.  You just wouldn't let this thing go! Your father would be so disappointed.  So would your late wife.  All due respect, I didn't do anything wrong here.  No? What you did was screw over the only person that can protect you from a job that you are clearly not ready for.  Good luck.  You're gonna need it.  You wanted to see us?   Is everything OK?   Agent Hubbard just called.  Homeland Security has concluded that the Dorseys have no ties to terrorists.  No shit.  They want to be kept in the loop, as does the FBI,   but we're back in control.    That's good news.  It would be if I hadn't just read your reports on what happened at Steve Dorsey's apartment.  What the fuck? Seriously, I should write both of you up.  That was all my fault, Deb.  It's Lieutenant.  And I got that.  You guys, we have two fucking days to catch Travis Marshall before he does God knows what in something called the lake of fire.  We just got this case back.  I cannot afford to have this department falling down around me right now, OK? No more fuck ups.  We get Travis Marshall, you got it? I made sure the Slice of Life was in the video I sent Travis.  He'll be expecting to find me on my boat.  Not this one.  The owners use it twice a year, but I only need it once.  For Travis' final tableau.  Captain! Morgan.  You going to pick out blinds for Matthews' office?   You heard the news.    From Matthews.  Because he thought that I ratted him out, but we both know that it was you, right? Rumours do have a way of spreading.  So Matthews comes to you and asks for help, and you go along with it, until Jessica Morris' father shows up.  Now, is that about the time that you realised you could stab him in the back? Interesting theory, but I have no idea what you're talking about.  Fucking used me to take him out and help yourself.  Don't be so naive, Morgan.  This is how the game is played.  Did you really think that Matthews made you lieutenant because you were ready? It was all politics to get back at me.  And that was his last mistake.  How do you sleep? Very well, knowing that from now on, you'll do what I say when I say it, or I'll find a lieutenant who will.  So LaGuerta's going on and on, and I'm dying inside.  And all of the sudden, I have one of those those moments where everything sort of comes together.    An epiphany.    Exactly.  And I realise that I have completely fucked myself into a corner.  What would you have done differently? Ignored a grieving father? Kept a case closed that didn't sit right with you? No.  And fuck no.  And I was trying to give you a compliment.  You've grown so much.  You made the best out of a bad situation, because now you see Everything isn't always so black and white.  Did you try the noodles? You have always blown at that.  And you're so good? Show me.  It's this finger, dumbass.    Like this?   Yeah.  Your hand's shaking, what is it? This.  One minute, everything's perfect.  And the next minute The next minute what? You're rushing off.  Deb I am always with you.  Right here.  Oh, fuck.  It worked.  Oh, no.  Not now.  You didn't really think you could foil God's plan, did you? This was how it was always meant to be.  I will wait on a pillar of light for God's return.  And you'll burn in eternal hellfire.  It is finished.  I thought I was headed in the right direction.  My dark passenger back behind the wheel.  But if I was so sure I knew where I was going, how did I get so lost?

        "script": "Previously on Dexter   What do you believe in, Mr Morgan?   Nothing.  You can believe whatever you wanna believe.  But it's not just about you any more.  It's why I'm making you Homicide's new lieutenant.  Fuckballs, you're serious.  There's something inside.  Holy frankenfuck! Snakes! So it's begun? Yes.  No! This Revelation expert, James Gellar.  The professor, from the University ofTallahassee? Gellar disappeared three years ago after he got fired.  Travis Marshall.  I suppose it was God who told you to kill all those innocent people.  God speaks to the professor.  You're saying Gellar does the killing? He's so much stronger than me.  Gellar.  He's been dead all along.  Travis, you killed Gellar.  \"Miami Metro Homicide. \" That's where God wants us to stage wormwood.  Dex, you saved a lot of lives today.  You saved my life.  Every time the shit hits the fan, I go to him.  He's your safe place.  You're making it sound like I want to be with him or something.  Well, do you? This is a job of trust.  And I can't have a partner I can't trust.  The beast is coming for you.  You didn't really think you could foil God's plan, did you? I guess it's fitting that I end up where I've left so many others.  I only wonder if the world will be a better place without me.  It's wrong what people say about dying.  I'm not flashing back over my life, over the lives I've taken.  I'm thinking about the life I'll miss.  Harrison.  I'll miss watching my son grow up.  Are you OK? You are very lucky.  God is looking out for you.  Where are we? Florida.  Maybe five miles away.  We'll be there soon.  Perhaps.  He's robbing us, and I have nothing to give.  I can give him death.  You're safe.  We'll be there soon.  \"It's finished.  \" Those were Travis' last words to me, and he's right.  There's no way to find him now.  I'm going home to my son.  Excuse me.    Do you have a phone I can use?   Oh, sure.  More on the ball games later.  And now, in other news The solar eclipse is due at 3:28 tomorrow afternoon.  It's a great opportunity to trick your kids into learning a little science.  Stick with us, and Dr Mehler will teach you how to make a simple pinhole camera that will allow you to watch in safety with your children.  But first, this message.  Stare at the sun, you idiots.  Better you be blinded than face the horrors that await you.  I can't stay here much longer if you're gonna stink like that.  Daddy.  I cannot believe you fell off your boat and swam to shore.  You must be exhausted.  Yeah.  Mostly, I feel dumb.  I'll be OK.  Let's go home.  Yeah.  I lost my keys, wallet, cell phone.  Yeah, of course.  Are you OK? Yeah.  Just thirsty, hungry.  I can't imagine if he would have lost you, Dexter.  You're very lucky.  Yeah.  Lucky.  What can I do to help?   We're good until the morning.    OK.  Don't forget, his pageant's tomorrow.  I'll be there.  Thank you.  If some God or some force did save me today I'm sure it was for you and not for me.  Today's the day.  Dex! I got a report that your boat had washed ashore.  I'm OK.  I'm OK.  Kept calling your cell phone, there was no answer.  God, you can't keep doing this to me.  I've almost lost you twice.  I love you.  I love you, too.  You do? Of course I do.  I don't think you've ever said it before.  It's a double murder.  There's blood.  Will you write down the address for me? Are you sure you're up for it? Yeah, I'm good.    You been inside yet?   No.  We've been waiting on you.  This was Travis.  He killed these people because he needed a place to hide.  Well, we'll take care, we'll find out.  It's about fucking time.  I had to get gas.  I'll never get used to that.  The sweet smell of hydrogen sulphide, carbon dioxide, and methane all liquefying into a frothy treat.  Where's Dex? Fuck me.  Fucking Travis Marshall was here.  Looks like it.  What's the painting of? It's the beast being thrown into the lake of fire.  It's the last tableau.  Why do you think he smashed in the face? I can't imagine.  Better go photograph the bodies.  I'll take care of this room.  What do you think happened here? I don't know.  Either way, it's a horrible way to go.  They were both killed by blows to the head.  Her, once.  Him, multiple times.  Blunt instrument.  Most likely that frying pan.  When? At least 48 hours ago.  You're looking at me weird.    Am I?   Aren't you? I'm just taking pictures, Deb.  OK.  Let's just focus on work right now, OK? OK.  Where the fuck is Travis Marshall? He could be anywhere.  You think he's done the lake of fire yet? I don't know.  He could just be hiding out somewhere.  He could just be kicking back with a beer, waiting for the eclipse.  That's very possible, Deb.  OK I'm gonna go back to the office.  I gotta find a way to catch this fucker.    I'll see you back there.    OK.  Sorry.  Despite what Travis said, maybe it's not quite finished.  My one advantage is that he thinks I'm dead.  Now, where do I go? Please, God.  I've done everything you've asked of me.  Thank you.  You know, my last day is coming up fast.  A dark day indeed.  You will be missed.  I was wondering there's no way I could stay on permanently? Maybe as an assistant? What about your video games? It just doesn't seem important any more.  Louis, Miami Metro Homicide is an elite crew, OK? Just because you're the world's greatest batboy doesn't mean that you're ready to pinch hit for the Yankees.  In other words finish training, you must.  Save you, it will, Luke.  Maybe I'll throw you some consulting work, just to keep your dick wet.  That'd be great.  This is the lake of fire.  It's the last of seven keys that's supposed to bring about the end of the world.  It was Travis' last tableau.  A picture taken last night about seven miles off the coast.  Some guy in an aeroplane saw it and took a picture with his cell phone.  Now based on this, I'm thinking that Travis has already completed tableau number seven.    Does anyone think I'm wrong?   I think we're in agreement.  We've got the coast guard out there looking for signs of a wreck or a body, but nothing yet.  Cos I'm right here.  So Travis is done with his work.  Now what? Well, now all Travis has to do is sit back and wait for the end of the world.  Which means he could be anywhere.  Or maybe not.  Maybe he's somewhere very specific.  Somewhere where we can grab his crazy ass.  Check this out.  This is Gellar's last sketch.    The two witnesses.    Yeah.  And their dog.  I guess Fido wanted to watch the end of the world, too.  So you're thinking if Travis is following Gellar's drawings, this points to where he'll be next? And what time he'll be there.  All this shit's gonna go down when the eclipse is happening.  Which is four hours from now.  Where do you go to watch an eclipse? Well, you'd want a good view.  No obstructions.  High ground.  Yeah, look where they are.  They're on a mountaintop.  Could be wrong, but I'm pretty sure there are no mountains in Miami.  Unless you find a substitute.    Fucking A   Skyscrapers.  Fucking big ass, tall as shit skyscrapers.    Makes sense.    It does, right? I'm gonna call LaGuerta.  I want to station unis on top of Miami's tallest buildings.  There's a lot of tall buildings in Miami.  I mean, that's gonna require a lot of manpower.  I don't care.  IfTravis gets away, he is gone for good.  Travis redid that same sketch yesterday, and it looks different.  I thought it was a mountain, but maybe it's a building.  What was the last thing Travis said to me? He'd be standing atop a shining pillar of light.  \"The solar powered Transcorp Building \"was designed to capture and reflect the sun \"as it moves across the Miami sky.  \" A pillar of light.    Hey.    Hey.  The abandoned church where Travis and Gellar were hanging out What about it? I need you to do a final forensic sweep so we can clear it.  I have Harrison's Noah's Ark pageant this afternoon.  I promised him.  Afterwards, then.  Copy that.  Hey What? Do we need to talk? I don't know.  Is there something we should talk about? I don't know.  You almost died.  I didn't know if you needed to unload or whatever.  I think I'm OK, but thanks, sis.  Great.  Don't forget about the church.  Got it.  I have plans for that church.  Whatever it is, I didn't do it.  This is exactly why I'm doing this.  You never take anything seriously.  Why you're doing what? I wanted to give you the heads up about your transfer.  What fucking transfer? I didn't ask for a transfer.    I'm putting one in for you.    The fuck you are.  I am.  You've been screwing up for the last few months.  And when you almost got me killed   I thought we settled that.    We did.  But as sergeant, I can't risk myself or anyone else here in Homicide any more.  Good talk, Sergeant.  So even though Travis Marshall killed Gellar, at some point, we're not sure when, he's still recreating images from Gellar's sketchbook, and this is the last one.  It's two witnesses looking at the eclipse from a mountaintop.  And skyscrapers are the mountaintops of Miami.  So you think that Travis Marshall will watch the eclipse from a skyscraper.  Can you narrow down which one? The Four Seasons is the tallest building in Miami, but we're not sure where he'll show up.  And that's why I want to put unis on top of every building over 400 feet.  Do it.  You're agreeing with me? If you think this is the best use of your resources, I trust your judgement.  Yeah, so when this blows up in my face, you can fire my ass.  I know that you think that I'm some heartless bitch, and sometimes I have to be.  But everything I do is always in the best interest of Miami Metro.  Matthews might disagree with that.  Well, Matthews put his dick before his department.  Yeah, and you cut it off.  You didn't hesitate to take advantage of that situation.  Was that really the best for Miami Metro? Morgan, we need to get Travis Marshall.  All I need to know is will this plan of yours work? Yes.  Then count on having all the manpower you need.  Did you look under your bed? Maybe Blanky's in here.  We're late.  Here it is.  Dexter.  OK, let's go.  So the beast has a son.  Be a big boy lion.  Just in time for the flood.  Sorry I'm late.  I was getting worried the world would have to make do with only one lion.  Just a few minutes, everybody, before the show begins.  Break a leg, you two.  OK, bud.  Remember what the lions say? Sorry.  It's OK, it's OK.  We're lions.  That's just what lions do.  All right, now we got an ark to get on.  And that boat has a place for all the animals, not just the sheep and the zebras, but the lions, too.  I'll be right with you, by your side.  Let's get that mask on.  Two by two, the animals went inside the ark.  The bunny rabbits, the tigers, even the lions.  All of God's creatures.  Noah welcomed them all on his boat.  And the rain kept falling for 40 days and 40 nights, until the whole world was covered in water.  The tallest building in Miami is the Four Seasons building, and this is where we believe Travis Marshall will be.  Sergeant Batista and Detective Quinn will accompany the two officers that are stationed there.  If you see Travis Marshall or contact is made, call for backup immediately.  He is highly unpredictable and very dangerous.  Let's go get this fucker.  Check in with me every 15, OK? I want to stay on top of this.  I spoke to my union rep.  We decided I have a problem with alcohol, and as long as I seek help and admit it, I can't be transferred or fired.  It's a disease.  Are you shitting me? That rule is for people that really have a problem.  You're not an alcoholic, you're just a fuck up.  Look, you said to take control of my life.  That's what I'm trying to do, OK? I like Homicide.  I'm in it for the long haul.  Why can't you put this much effort into actual police work? We remind you to not look directly at the sun.  The eclipse will happen within the hour.  And the two witnesses will watch the world end with their dog.  I still don't get the dog.  Why do they want to bring the dog? Are you sure that's a dog? What else could it be? A sheep, a lamb.  Lamb of God? A lamb.  We've seen that before.  Yeah, it was that hot chick that Quinn fucked.  Carissa Porter, right.  She was in that tableau that Gellar staged at the University of Tallahassee.  She slaughtered a lamb.  The school newspaper sent the contact sheets from that day.  I've got them right here.  The lamb has only an omega on its forehead, no alpha.  An omega.  The end.  Killing the lamb signifies the end.  Holy fuck.  What ifTravis isn't done killing?   Deb.    I think Travis is gonna kill again.    When?   Before the eclipse.  That's an hour from now.  I know, but I think he's gonna make a sacrifice.  An offering to his god.  It makes sense, right? A spilling of blood to bless the new world.  I mean, I'm not 100% sure, but In the last drawing from Gellar's book, one of the witnesses has a sword, and the animal approaching them is A lamb.  And that tableau that Gellar did on campus a few years back, the slaughter of a lamb.  I don't know what a lamb means to this crazy prick.  It could be an actual lamb, it could be an innocent of some kind, but I think that could be his next kill.  I gotta go.  Excuse me, Sister.  Have you seen Harrison? Yes.  He just left.  He left? He was with a man wearing a lion's mask.    I thought it was you.    Where'd they go? The time is nigh and the end is near It's time for God's children to listen and hear For his word has said that the world will end And the mountain will fall when he comes again Hey! Hey, little boy! Hey, come back here! The time is 3:26.  Get ready for the eclipse Should all be in place by now, right? Yeah.  Four Seasons, this is Lieutenant Morgan.  We're all clear up here.  No sign of Travis or a lamb of any kind.  Copy that.  Miami Tower, this is Lieutenant Morgan.  All clear? All clear.  Copy that.  Transcorp Building, this is Lieutenant Morgan.  All clear? Transcorp? Transcorp? All clear.  So jump to the sky Repent of your sins Run to your saviour and you'll be saved again It is done.  I am the alpha and the omega.  I am the beginning and the end.  I am making everything new.  No! Stop! What? Get away from him! I killed you.  Stay back! You're supposed to be dead.  How's the world going to end if the beast is still alive? It won't.  Until the beast is dead, a sacrifice is meaningless.  Time is running out, Travis.  I know that.  Stay there! Take me, and let my son go.  You need me.  You don't need him.  Let him go.  Take him to the elevator.  Do you have any of your needles with you? Yes.  Let's see it.  Show me.  Inject yourself.  I will, but not until you let him go.  It's OK, buddy.  Stop! You stay there! Inject yourself, or I'll kill him.  Do it now! The eclipse is here, Travis.  Daddy's here.  Looks like the moon has just finished traversing the sun.  Lieutenant, it's the Four Seasons.  We're all clear.  Miami Tower's all clear.  Marquis, all clear.  The eclipse is over.  Nothing happened.  Marinablue, all clear.  Transcorp hasn't checked in.  Transcorp, this is Lieutenant Morgan.  Are you there? Are you there? Transcorp, do you copy? God fucking damn it! on top of the Transcorp Building.  Get the paramedics up here now.  Search every fucking inch of this place!   Yes, ma'am.    First quadrant, clear.    Second quadrant, clear.    Third quadrant, clear.    Fourth quadrant, clear.    All clear.  No sign of Marshall.  Lieutenant! What the fuck is that? Looks like it was some kind of altar.  Maybe the officer was the sacrifice.  Let's go! Move! South quadrant.  Deb, what happened? He got away.  Lieutenant, the officer's dead.  Deb, you OK? What does it matter? How does any of it fucking matter? Shit.  Where's Morgan? She needed a moment alone.  She's over there.  Oh, fuck.  Fuck.  Don't, OK? You made the right call.  What is this, you being understanding? Pragmatic.  You kick a horse during the race, not after it's over.  Travis Marshall was here.  Yeah, and an officer is dead.  Because of Travis Marshall.  Who's still out there.  Who knows what he'll do next? He's capable of anything.  And if he fucking disappears, this case could stay open forever.  You'd always have that to throw back in my face.  I won't do that.  Why, it's not best for Miami Metro? Because you'll find him.  You have the potential to be a good lieutenant, but you need to prioritise.  You're letting your emotions take charge of you.  You know what worked for me? Making my job the centre of my life.  Puts everything else in perspective because the control is all mine.  And that's what you need to do, Deb, take control.  One thing I'm sure I have faith in is the staying power of animal tranquilisers.  Is that my shirt? The mighty kings return! It's a jungle out there.  Here, I'll put him to bed.  No, I got it.  I have to go back out.    Late night?   Probably not too late.  Deb wants me to go back to a crime scene,   collect some evidence.    OK.  Let me see those paws, let me see those paws.  I'm glad you're safe.  Whether you're a lion or a lamb, I'll always love you.  Maybe that's all I need to pass on to you.  You were right.  Debra, we can schedule a time I told him.  I fucking told my brother that I love him, and he said \"I love you\" back.  Not, \"Me, too,\" or something like that.    He actually said, \"I love you. \"   Wow.  That's big, isn't it? Yeah, I mean, I don't think he understood that I'm in love with him, but still, he said the actual words for the first time.  So what do you think it means? I don't know what the fuck it means.  That's why I'm here.  Is this just horribly wrong? Does it feel wrong? It makes my whole life every man I've ever loved, make sense.  It's like I've always been looking for someone like Dexter or someone who's the opposite of Dexter as a way to avoid the fact that I'm in love with him.  That's just clear to me now, and I want it to be clear to him.  I want him to understand.  OK.  You want to tell him how you feel in a way that he can hear you.  Yes.  Is this how it feels to be in control of your emotions? But you can't control his.  You don't know how he's going to react.  Hello, Jesus.  Hello, Travis.  What? What is going on? This is the way the world ends.    Your world, anyway.    No! No, no! I'm supposed to finish enacting the seven keys.    Sorry.    But I was chosen! I was chosen to bring about the new world.  Chosen to kill innocent people? No one is innocent.  My son is.  You tried to kill him.  God allowed his son to die.  How could you believe in that? Because I walk the path of the righteous.  I've known people who believed in God.  They would never use their faith as a convenient excuse to kill 10 people.  You used God.  It's not the other way around.  You You are a shining example of how putrid man has become.  I am a father, a son, a serial killer.  You're going to burn in hell.  No, I think I belong right here.  Because maybe there is a place for me in this world just as I am.  Light cannot exist without darkness.  Each has its purpose.  And if there is a purpose to my darkness, maybe it's to bring some balance to the world.  Because, let's face it, the world is going to be a better place without you.  The world is going to end.  And when it does, I will be by God's side.    You sure about that?   Yes.  Good for you.  You're mocking me.  No, I almost envy you.  It must be nice to be so certain.  You're wrong about everything because you don't believe in God, but I have faith.  I trust in God's plan.  Really? Then it must be God's plan that you're on my table.  Do you think it's God's will that I'm about to kill you? God has nothing to do with this! You are wrapped in plastic because I want to kill you.  This is not how it's supposed to be! Maybe this is exactly how it's supposed to be.  Maybe everything is exactly as it should be.  Oh, God.      Previous EpisodeNext Episode"

You've been the one constantly good thing in my life.    There's something inside.    Holy frankenfuck! Snakes!   So it's begun?   Yes.    It's begun.    No! Is this Doomsday? I'm taking a lot of heat on Doomsday.  Are we making any headway? I'm about to interview my top pick for detective.  So far, our Doomsday killer has given us three tableaus most likely referencing Revelation, chapters eight through 10.    I think I found a new lead.    Who's this? Latest and greatest intern from my forensics class.  The game is about homicide but in my game, you can be the serial killer.  I think this is offensive.  Who would choose to be a serial killer? Are you out of your mind? You fucked a person of interest?   Maybe you're jealous.    This is a job of trust and I can't have a partner I can't trust.

He can't be saved from it any more than I can from mine.  I think Travis is gonna kill again.  The eclipse is here, Travis.  This is not how it's supposed to be! It is exactly as it should be.  Oh, God.  It's simple human nature to keep little secrets about ourselves.  We all do it.  I dye my hair.  I watch internet pornography.  But what if your whole life is a secret?   A lie.    How can I help you? One economy class ticket, flight 449.    To Budapest.    Correct.  And exposing the truth could destroy everything you are.  What do you do?   Run?   Oh, God.    Get the fuck away from the body.    Deb, it's me.    Who's on the altar?   Travis Marshall.  Dexter, what the fuck?   Oh, shit.    Talk to me.  Could you lower your gun? Please? I came to do one last forensics sweep like you asked me to do Travis was here.  He came at me with his sword.  I fought him off.  I knocked him out.  How did he end up wrapped in plastic on the altar? I snapped.  You Snapped? What the fuck does that mean? There's been a lot of anger inside me since Rita died and when I looked at Travis and thought about everything he did I wanted him dead, so I killed him.  That still doesn't explain why he's wrapped up like that.  I didn't even think about it.  I'm a forensics expert.  I guess it's just second nature not to leave a trace.  Jesus, Dex.  Why the fuck didn't you call me? I wasn't exactly in the best state of mind.    Are you hurt?   No.  Physically, I'm okay.    Who are you calling?   The station.    I've gotta get everyone down here.    No.  Please wait.  Why? How does this look?   Pretty fucking weird.    Exactly.  An investigation could complicate our lives more than either of us are prepared to deal with.  But it was self defence.  Yeah.  But it's pretty fucking weird.  I have to call this in.  You had a moment of temporary insanity.  We can fix this.  How? I'll get you the best fucking lawyer in the city.  Even if I'm lucky enough to get off due to temporary insanity they'll still put me in some psych ward.  I'll lose my job, my career.  And probably even Harrison.    So what then?   Travis is dead.    Yes.    Nothing's gonna change that.  Maybe we should just get rid of the body.  What? I could put it in my car, take it somewhere and dump it   where no one would ever find it.    No.    If I'm careful     No.  Use your head.  If you get caught with the body, everything's ten times worse.  We're not moving the fucking body anywhere.  Okay.  We make it look like a suicide.  Frustrated the world didn't end like he predicted Travis committed ritual suicide at the church altar stabbing himself with his sword.  Maybe.  But not before first setting the church on fire.  Fire is biblical.  One last tableau.  And it'll erase any trace that we were ever here.  How do we do that? It would have to burn so fast.  Gasoline.  There's a station nearby.    I'll go get a couple of gallons.    No, Deb, go home.  I'll do it.    I know what I'm doing.    Bullshit.  Jesus, Debra.  He's a good doggy.    Hey, Deb.    His name is Banjo.    Where did that dog come from?   The Millikans' dog had a litter.    I couldn't resist.    No dogs in this house ever.    But why? Because.    Harry, look how much Debra loves     End of discussion.  Dexter.  Don't even think about it.  I have to do whatever it takes to keep Deb from the full truth.  I have to keep my secret safe.  Otherwise, my life, her life, will never be the same.  Oh, fuck, Dexter, I don't know if this was the right thing to do.  It's only a matter of time before we get called back here.    We have to go.    Go where?   Go home.    I don't wanna be alone.  I don't want you to be alone.  Well, just follow me.  We can't stay here.  This is all wrong.  I should be on my boat right now dumping the bags overboard.  I can't let this get away from me.  Morgan.  All right, everyone knows their jobs.  Let's do this.  The arson investigator said the fire started somewhere in the middle of the church.  The melted remains of a gas can seem to confirm that.  I was also able to get one fingerprint that does give us preliminary confirmation that this is Travis Marshall.  Travis appears to have doused himself in gasoline as well.  He then climbed up on the altar, grabbed his sword at the hilt and plunged it into his heart.  One final tableau.    He died instantly.    Please tell me he felt a little pain.  It makes sense.  World didn't end like he predicted so he had to end his.  Good.  Saves us the trouble having to do it.  Cheer up, Lieutenant.  This is a big win.  Would have been better to catch him alive.  Plastic.  After all he did? Fuck him.  Masuka.  Masuka.  Is it possible to kill yourself with a sword? Oh, yeah, sure.  The ancient art of hara kiri has been well established particularly amongst my own ancestors as a penance for various embarrassing and humiliating transgressions.  Congratulations, Lieutenant.  Miami has one less murderer on the loose.    Thank you.    There's a large press gathering outside.  This is a good opportunity for you to make a statement.  Still a lot to be done in here.  She's not as comfortable lying to the world as I am.  It's okay, Lieutenant.  You can go.  We're just wrapping things up.    Go talk to them.    Come on.  I'll be right behind you.  I'll sneak out back.  If the press sees me they'll only want to talk to me and you're the hero this time.  But it's more heroic if you do it Hey.  Hey, you.  Come here.  Would you make sure this gets logged'? Thanks.  Even if I put Deb in the uncomfortable position of lying for me at least I've kept the bigger truth from her.  It'll all be okay.  Oh, hey, Dexter.    What are you doing here?   Jamie's putting Harrison to bed.  I didn't wanna wake him.  You used my computer without my permission? I just wanted to check the basketball scores.    I thought it would be okay.    It's not okay.  Okay, well, I'm really, really sorry.  I don't give a shit if you're sorry, Louis.  Never touch my things.    Louis, here you are.    Yeah, here he is.  What are you doing here? This is Dexter's side of the apartment.  I didn't realise there were different sides.  I'm, like, super sorry.    Is Harrison asleep?   Yeah.  He's out.    You should go home.    Okay.  Shit.  It'll all be okay.  You know, everyone acts like Dexter's such a great guy but he's really kind of a pompous jerk, don't you think? No.  Come on.  He's all like, \"Don't touch my shit, man. \"   What a dick.    Louis.  What is your problem? Dexter's my boss, okay? And he happens to be very good to me.  I still don't understand why you were on his side.  Well, I told you.  I just wanted to get some water.  Right.  You know, the more I get to know you, the weirder and weirder you get.  And we go live to this Breaking News 9 special report.  I can only speculate but I think it's fair to say that Travis Marshall felt the intense pressure of Miami Metro zeroing in on him and that led to his decision to commit suicide.  Lieutenant, are you ruling out the possibility that this was a murder?   Hey, Mike.    Just had a thought.  Where was his car?   Whose car?   Travis Marshall's.  His car wasn't found at the scene, so how'd he get to the church? I'm guessing that a man that was about to stab himself in the heart with a sword probably wouldn't see a long walk as a big deal.  Probably right, but still Sure.  Yeah.  You should check it out.  I Will.  First thing in the morning.  Good night, Lt.    Need some help?   No.  No, thank you.    It's okay.  I can fix it.    Relax.  I'm a cop.    Where's your lug wrench at?   No! How were you so perfectly prepared to kill Travis?   What do you mean?   The plastic wrap? You just happened to have that with you? I found it in the storeroom.  What about the knives? You said Travis came at you with a sword.  Where did you get the knives? There was like a whole roll of them.  Travis had them with him.  They were his knives.  I don't know where he got them from.  You weren't in your regular work clothes.  You changed.  You had a rubber apron.  Plastic sleeves.  I'm just trying to put this together.  Deb, I'm sorry I put you in this situation.    You look pretty stressed.    Yeah.  But You know, my job can get messy.  I always keep a change of clothes in my car.  And the apron, all that other stuff, is just part of my kit.  Every blood spatter guy's got them.  What about when you said, \"I know what I'm doing\"? When you tried to get me to go, you said, \"I know what I'm doing. \" What did you mean? I meant I work crime scenes every day.  I know what people like me look for, so I know what to cover up.  This doesn't feel right.  I know it doesn't.  Deb, I never meant to get you involved in any of this.  But I am.  We gotta go to work.  What's wrong? We had to give Banjo back.  I am so sorry, sweetheart.  I never should have gotten him without talking to your dad.    This is all my fault.    I want Banjo back.  No.  It's all my fault.  Deb.  Look, I made a huge mistake.  I admit it.  But other than saying I'm sorry again and again I don't know what else to say.  Morgan.  What? When? Jesus, fuck.  That was Dispatch.  Mike's been shot.    Is he okay?   I don't know.    I'm right behind you.    Now, Dex.  Deb, I gotta find my keys, put my bag together.  I'll get Dispatch to text me the address.  I'll be two minutes behind you.  MY getaway pack.  I don't want to run.  But if Deb doesn't let up, that may be my only option.  Mike Anderson.  One of our own.  Whoever did this to Mike is gonna be very sorry.    He'll be very fucking dead.    Hey.  We do everything by the book.  We're cops, not killers.  But being a killer would feel so very good right about now.  She suffered blunt force trauma to the head.  From something narrow and cylindrical.    Steel pipe? Tyre iron?   Yeah, something like that.  The first blow was the left side of the head and then three more blows to the top much harder.  She Her skull was fractured and she haemorrhaged, as evidenced by the blood that's trickling from her ear.  When will she believe me?   What happens if she never does?   When do you think she bought it? Rigour has set in.  She hasn't been moved from this trunk and judging from the lividity and pooling on the right side of her face   I'd say eight to twelve hours ago.    Not long after we all left the church.    Yeah.    What a fucked up couple of days.  I couldn't agree with you more.  We're looking for one shooter at a minimum.  The shooter hits this girl, dumps her in the trunk, speeds off.  Gets a flat tyre.  He repays Mike's kindness by shooting him and fleeing in Mike's car.  His car was found in an industrial park near North West 52nd.    I've got people there.  Start canvassing.    And here? Any witnesses? None so far.  Maybe somebody saw something.  I'm on my way to talk to Mike's wife.  All of her family's in Chicago and she's gonna need all our support.  Anything she needs.  Hopefully Dexter and I will win the DNA lottery because it looks he wiped the car clean.  Nothing on prints, except for hers.  Well, judging by her attire or lack of it, she was a stripper.  And on duty at the time of her death.  I've got an ID on the fingerprints.  A Kaja Soroka.  Same person this car's registered to.  We'll find out where she works.  The steering wheel, shifter, door handles, seatbelt buckle they're all wiped clean.  But there's always one place they forget to clean: the turn signal.    You're clear.    Oh, fuck.  The road's clear.  Thank you.  Fuck.  Excuse me.  I need to see the files on the Ice Truck Killer case.    Row F 17.    Thank you.  Kaja Soroka was a Ukrainian national here on a work visa.  She worked at the Fox Hole gentleman's club in Pinecrest.  The same owner is listed as having five other strip clubs in Miami.  Looked into them with Narcotics.  Figured they were using the places to launder money but we never got anywhere.  Let's get somewhere now.  Quinn and I is gonna take the Fox Hole.  The rest of you split up the rest of the clubs.  Let's go.  All the prints belong to Miss Soroka except the one from the turn signal.  But there aren't any matches in Florida AFIS, FBI or DHS.  There's always Interpol.  I had this weird flashback of being on Rudy's ta Brian's ta   Whatever the fuck you wanna call him.  Your brother's table.  Sorry.  That must have felt not good for you.  It didn't.  But what bothers me about it is that I was set up on that table the same way Travis Marshall was set up on the altar.    Deb     I mean, how do you explain that? I don't know, I was there too.    I pulled you off that table.    I was on that table.  I almost died on that table.  You would think that I would remember every fucking detail.  But even I don't remember it that clearly.  Dexter, you were somehow able to perfectly duplicate how he set everything up.  The same positioning.  The same amount of plastic wrap.  They are the same, Dexter.  They are exactly the same.  Because Brian was imitating me.  This is crazy, Deb.  I know that.  It's crazy that I did what I did.  It's crazy that you just happened to walk in and see me doing it.  I mean, what were you doing in the church, anyway? It was just I was just fucking checking to see if everything was okay.  I'm sorry for all the questions.  I'm just   Dexter, I'm trying to make sense of this.  Deb, it's not gonna make sense.    Did you find anything in the car?   No, not yet.  Give up, Deb.  Give up and just leave this alone.  We have a match.  Viktor Baskov.  When you're losing control of your entire life it helps to focus on what you're good at.  My little secret.  I shouldn't be doing a kill now.  The irony is that's the only way I can maintain control the only way I can keep this from Deb.  Someone packed in a hurry.  Blood.  And gunshot residue.  Looks like you're our man, Viktor.  How careless were you, Viktor? One first class one way ticket to Kiev, Ukraine leaving in less than two hours.  Very careless.  How can I help you? One economy class ticket, flight 449.    To Budapest.    Correct.  That will be $1890, please, Mr.  Hartwell.    Dog track.    Lucky you.  Yeah, lucky me.    You're all set.    Thank you.    Step through.    Please wait.    Wait, sir.  What are these for?   Diabetes.  I have a prescription if you wanna see it.  Go ahead.  Hello, Viktor.  Right here, sweetheart.    Kill the music.    Good afternoon, everyone.  I'm Sergeant Batista from Miami Metro Homicide.  We are investigating the suspected homicide of one Kaja Soroka as well as the homicide of a Miami Metro police officer.  And no one is leaving until they've been questioned.  Employees of the club up against this wall.  The rest of you perverts, this wall.    Is there a manager here?   Yeah, I'm the manager.    You heard him.    Let's go.    George Novikov.    Oh, my God.  An employee and a pervert.  I don't know which wall you go to.    You know this guy?   Yeah, he was a low level scumbag.    Now I guess he's a mid level scumbag.    Nice to see you, Detective Quinn.  What can you tell me about Miss Soroka? Kaja wasn't the smartest girl in the world.  No? These girls come here from little villages, still stinking of cow shit.  They think they're gonna land some rich husband.  Hook up with the wrong guys, end up over their heads.    Is that what you think happened?   I really have no idea what happened.  Look, I'm sorry Kaja's dead, you know? She was a sweet kid.  And I'm sorry about your police officer too.  Their deaths have nothing to do with us.  We can start with you supplying me with a list of all of your employees.  Sure.  Can I get a head count list at the main bar'? Something cold to drink?   Your name, please?   Foxy Raven.  All right.  Is that the name your mother gave you? And maybe you could show me some form of ID.    I do not speak English.    No, of course you don't.  One of our guys found blood outside the door.    Sir, I have your wheelchair.    I don't need a wheelchair   It never matters your destination.  The smart traveller must be prepared to make last minute adjustments.    Lieutenant, you got a second?   Yeah, what's up? We shut down the strip club questioned everyone, but didn't get shit.  We know she worked last night.  She signed in at 10, never signed out.  We found blood in the parking lot which we believe belongs to Soroka.  With that, we still haven't gotten anywhere.    No one saw her leave?   No.  No one remembers any customers she might have talked to.  No one remembers seeing her car in the parking lot.  No one saw shit.    She's a fucking ghost in a G string.    Bullshit.  She walked out of a club in the middle of her shift.  Someone saw.  These places are mobbed up, Russian, Ukrainian crime.  Strippers who are brought in, they know not to talk.    How would you like us to proceed?   Shut down every club every night until someone talks.  We're on it.  I'm gonna need more coffee.    Coffee truck?   No.  I already got so much caffeine in my head, I can barely think.  You know what, you're not gonna get anything done tonight.  Just go home.  It's been a very long, very fucked up day.  I'm too worked up to sleep but I could use a drink.    Knock one back in Mike's honour?   Lead the way.    You coming, Lieutenant?   Rain check.    But slam a double for me.    Sure.    Good night.    Night.  Good night.    What's up, Lieutenant?   Any progress? We know our shooter was wearing size ten Prada shoes.  Very pricey.  We know he was right handed.  So that narrows it down to about 800 million people.    Dexter here?   No.  I told him I'd work late if he came in early.  Scotch and whatever my friend is having.  I'll have a vodka.  Don't you mean Shirley Temple? What, I can't toast to Mike?   To Mike.    To Mike.  What if your union rep sees? Aren't you in some kind of programme? I start next week.  Good.  Sooner you address your problem, the better.    I'm tired of your shit.    Still breaking my balls? You lose one girlfriend and the wheels come off.    I'm a sensitive guy.    I lost two wives and countless girlfriends.  I managed to keep my shit together.  I wish my life was more like yours.  You're living the fucking dream.  Keep it up.  I'll put in for that transfer.  I don't care what the union says.    I'll make it happen.    I thought you put in for my transfer.  Didn't quite get around to it.  So you were just fucking with me? You didn't want me to leave.    You were trying to get me to shape up.    A lot of good that did.    You still fucking love me.    Fuck you.  I try to help you and you go running to your union rep like a little bitch.  That was weak.    Well, actually     What? I plan on talking with him as soon as I find out who he is.    What about this programme you're in?   That's bullshit.  You know I don't have a drinking problem.  Or maybe that's just me in denial.  Who knows?   We may never get to the bottom of this.    Just deal with your shit.  Mike was a hundred times better cop than we'll ever be.  I'll drink to that.  Hello, Viktor.  Where am I? You're in a place where things are forgotten.  Never to be used or seen or touched again.  It seems fitting for a cop killer.  Not to dismiss Kaja Soroka.  She counts too.    Who are you?   Good question.  It all depends on who you ask.  Who sent you? You should not fuck with me.  I have very dangerous friends.  If you knew how many times I've heard that over the years.  What do you want? Money? I can get you a lot of money.    I've heard that a lot too.    Why are you doing this? You want the long version? That could take a couple of hours.  Short version.  Because I have to.  Because I need control.  I'm trying to make things go back to the way they were.  You're crazy.  There's really no need for name calling, Viktor.  Is there anything I can do to keep you from killing me?   No.    Then get it over with.  Normally, I don't take orders.  But in this case How can I help you?   This is Isaak.    Viktor left on an evening flight.  He arrives in Kiev at 5:25 p. m.  your time.  Good.  What about the dead police officer? That's still a problem but they don't have shit on us, so   I'll make it go away.    Good.  Ridding the world of people like Viktor is the one thing I'm good at.  When I'm stressed near to the breaking point, like now it centers me.  Maybe nothing has to change with Deb.  Hello?   Hi, Jamie.  ls Dexter there? It's Deb.    No, he's working late.    He's at work?   Yeah.  He said with Mike's shooting and everything, he might be there all night.  Oh, yeah, right.  Does that happen a lot? I mean, I know I should know his hours and everything.  It's just that I'm always juggling things, $0 Oh, yeah, he works crazy hours.  Lots of nights till 3, 4 a. m.    All right.  Okay, thanks.    Want me to have him call you? No.  No, I'll see him at work tomorrow.    Okay.    Good night.    What's his name?   Banjo.    Are you okay?   No.  Why did Daddy take the real Banjo away?   What did I do wrong?   You didn't do anything.  It's me.  It's my fault.  Why? What did you do? Dexter's allergic to dogs, sweetie.  That's why we can't have them.  Sorry.    What were you going to tell her?   The truth.  What is the truth? That you got rid of the dog because you thought I might kill it.    But I wouldn't.    I couldn't take that chance.  But what's more important is that you mustn't ever tell Debra the truth about yourself.    Why?   If you think she's upset now that's nothing compared to how she'd feel if she learned what you are.    She'd be terrified.    But she loves me.  Dex, she loves who she thinks you are.  If she ever saw the real you, she'd never get over it.  Son, your mother and I aren't gonna be around forever.  Someday Debra will be all you have left.  You don't wanna lose her, do you? My mistake was stepping outside the code.  I should have killed Travis the instant I met him rather than try to save him.  Compassion does not fit me.    You're ready?   Yes, I'm ready to join you.  But I can't.  Not Deb.  No, you can't be a killer and a hero.  Vincent.    You're working late.    Yeah, well, lots to do.  Everyone's doing double shifts.  I know you're working on Mike's case and that's top priority.  Wondering if anyone had a chance to go through the evidence from the church.  Sorry.  It's all in those boxes over there but I'm kind of swamped here.  Of course.  Hey, does our forensics team ever take blood slides at crime scenes? No.  If any of the evidence is transportable, we bag it.  Otherwise, if it's blood, we absorb into cotton squares   then we bag it.    I see.  Only one person who ever worked at Miami Metro ever took blood slides.    And that was?   Sergeant Doakes.  And that was only because of his side gig as the Bay Harbour Butcher.  Right.  Of course, Sergeant Doakes.  Thank you.  None of us want to be fully revealed all our faults and weaknesses laid bare for the world to see.  All the more reason to make sure I never again stray from what Harry taught me.  Did you kill all these people? I did.  Are you Are you a serial killer? Yes.      Previous EpisodeNext Episode"

        "script": "Previously on Dexter   Where's your lug wrench at?   No! We are investigating the homicide of a Miami Metro Police officer.  Viktor left on an evening flight.  He arrives in Kiev at 5:25 p. m. , your time.  What about the dead police officer?   I'll make it go away.    Good.    Hello, Viktor.    Is there anything I can do   to keep you from killing me?   No.  In my game, you can be the serial killer.  I think this is offensive.  Who would choose to be a serial killer? It's a bad idea.  Do something else.  Only one person who ever worked at Miami Metro ever took blood slides.  Sergeant Doakes, the Bay Harbour Butcher.  What happened was too strong.  It got into you too early.  You mustn't ever tell Debra the truth about yourself.  If you think she's upset now that's nothing compared to how she'd feel if she learned what you are.  Dexter, what the fuck? You said Travis came at you with a sword.  Where did you get the knives? There was a roll of them.  I'm just trying to put this together.  Are you a serial killer? Yes.  I've dreaded this moment my whole life.  But I never pictured it like this.  Don't you fucking touch me.  I just want to know you're okay.  I am not okay.    I am never gonna fucking be okay.    Just try to take it easy.  Oh, my God, I can't believe this.  How long have you been doing this? How long have you been fucking doing this? Since I was 20.  Oh, Jesus fucking Christ, Dexter.  Those blood slides that I found in your apartment they look like the ones we found in Doakes' car.  Deb.  Are you the Bay Harbour Butcher? This is not the place to talk about this.  Deb.    I only kill certain kinds of people   Oh, God.  like Travis.  Deb, Dad taught me.  He gave me a code.  Dad knew? It was his idea.  He knew everything.    Oh, fuck.    Deb.  Please, just Just come back inside with me.  Please.  Harry found me sitting in a pool of my mother's blood.  He understood why I had these urges.  A lot of horrible things happen to a lot of people.  And they don't turn out like you.  I don't know about other people.  But I have this need deep inside me.  I call it my dark passenger.  You gave it a name? Harry said it got in me too early and too deep.  He said I couldn't change it.  And so he thought up the code.  He said if I had to kill, I might as well kill people who deserved it.  You make it sound like it's okay, like you're the victim here.  The people in that box, Dexter they're the victims.  Victims? A choir director who raped and murdered little boys? A married couple smuggling refugees who killed the ones who couldn't pay? A psychiatrist who manipulated women into taking their own lives? There's this place called the police department.  Sometimes the system doesn't work.  Killers fall through the cracks.  Don't I fucking know it? I'm talking to one right now.  I am the worst fucking detective in the world.  You're my own brother.  How could I not see what you were doing?   You're not responsible for this.    Well, I am now.  I helped you cover up Travis' murder.    I'm an accomplice.    You walked in on me.    I had to think on my feet.    Well, fuck me for ruining your night.  What am I supposed to do here? My name has the word \"lieutenant\" in front of it.  I can't turn my back on this.  All of this is very, very fucking wrong.  So what are you gonna do? I never wanted her to go through this, Dex.  Neither did I.  Then you should have been more careful.  At least she didn't arrest me.  Not yet.  What is this doing here? Is it some kind of message? Maybe someone else is on to me.  According to FBI Special Agent Frank Lundy: \"it's almost certain that the butcher is still at work.  Serial killers have an addiction and will continue to kill until they're caught. \" If the ITK hand in my apartment is genuine then it can't still be in Evidence.  Not here.  Then I was sent the real thing.  No record of it being checked out.  Could it have been stolen? Sorry.  Sorry.  Saw you come in here.  I just got curious.    Now I wish I hadn't.    Why? You're looking for the hand, aren't you? Look, I can explain.  Look, remember my former intern Ryan? Blond, stacked and the cause of many sleepless nights?   Yeah.    Well, she needed some extra dough so she stole the hand and auctioned it online.  That's why I fired her.    Who won the auction?   Don't know.    I put Louis on the case to find out.    Louis? Not even with all his digital skills, he couldn't dig up a name.  At least he was able to erase the electronic trail.  Did Louis find the hand and keep it? No one needs to know, right? But why send the work of a serial killer to me? Does Louis know what I am? Dex? What? We're cool, right? Yeah.  No one needs to know.  Oh, thank God.    I was ready to blow you.    Not necessary.    Briefing.  You coming?   Yeah.  I have to find out what Louis knows about me.  Some time alone with him and he'd open up one way or another.  But I need to put out fires, not start new ones.  Remember him? It's been three days since Mike was gunned down.  The son of a bitch that pulled the trigger is still walking the streets.  Where are we? We're continuing to hit the club where Miss Soroka was employed.  Someone there must've seen something related to her death.  We think it's our best shot at a lead, Gonna shut them down every night.  You know, those places do big business during lunch too.    Just saying.    Start shutting them down twice a day.    With pleasure.    Moving on.  This pretty face belongs to Wayne Randall.  Fifteen years ago, Randall and his teenage girlfriend went on a three state killing spree that ended here in Miami.  He's currently serving two consecutive life terms at Dade.  Randall now claims to have evidence on three other murders that he committed in the Miami area, and he wants to come clean.  He wants to lead investigators to where he buried the bodies.  That's nice of him.  He says he wants to clear his conscience.  His lawyers are just trying to swing a deal.  What's he telling us? He told us about one victim, a brunette in her mid 20s that matches a missing persons report from that time, a Janice Dubois.  There's a chance he's not completely full of shit.  County has requested one detective and one lab tech to help them process the scene.    Miller?   Yeah.    You're volunteer number one.    I'll go.  No.    I want Masuka on this.    I don't to work a dumpsite.  Come on, I'm up to my ears on Mike's case.  I'm sorry.  You're with Miller.  Contact info will be in your boxes.  You'll start tomorrow.  That's it.  Thank you.  Can I talk to you outside for a second? I was this close to arresting you this morning.  I even thought about what I would say to the press.  I wouldn't want to have to write that speech.  I don't know what to do.  Every alternative I can think of is fucking crazy.  Such as? It's fucked up.  Try me.  They say people like you are addicts.  Like drugs.  It's not untrue.  Well, when addicts want to get better, they go to rehab.  I don't think there are clinics for what I've got.  We can make one.  I could be your clinic.    How?   You move in with me.  I watch you 24/7 and make sure that there's no way in hell you can do what you do and if it is an addiction, then maybe Maybe you can get over it.  You're right.  It's crazy.  Dexter, if you can channel your urges why can't you control them? What if Dad had taught you how to quit instead of teaching you how to live with it?   He fucked up.    There's a big problem with this idea.  What? I've tried stopping before.  It didn't work.  Well, now you have me.  Someone who loves you more than you will ever fucking know.  And in spite of all of this, I still believe that there is good in you.  Maybe more that's in most people.  What if it doesn't work? I don't I don't want to think about that.  And how much choice do I have here? None.  Okay.  Thanks for getting back to me so quickly.  I'm curious.  Your facilities are state of the art.  Why go through a private lab? Just trying to lighten the load.  It's been a hectic few months.  Look, just to confirm the blood you sampled from the glass fragment is a positive match with Travis Marshall's? No question about it.  Thank you.  Thanks.  Remember, keep this confidential.  And when you send back the findings, address them to me personally, okay?   No problem.    Great.  Thanks.    Yes, captain?   Regional FBI office, please.  We are back! Hey! I won't allow this to go on.  This is harassment.  No, this is an inconvenience.  We're working our way up to harassment.  I told you the last time you were here, I don't know who killed Kaja.  I don't know who shot your policeman.  Kaja was clubbed to death in the parking lot   15 yards from where we are.    No one saw anything.    Sell that somewhere else.    What are you gonna do? Gonna keep coming every day and shut me down? No, I'm coming back tonight too.    What the fuck do you want from me?   I want the shooter.  You rack your brain and give me something or I'm gonna turn this place into a fucking monastery.  You got that list? Follow me.  You know, the money we make here is all we have to live on.  What you're doing is really unfair.  What's your name?   Nadia.    Come here.  Have a drink.  We're not supposed to drink while we're working.  Come on.  You hear any music playing? Now, what you said isn't true.  I do care who killed Kaja but no one around here seems interested in helping me find out who it is.  Okay? Do you know anybody who might be interested in hurting your friend? You've been told not to cooperate with us? Kaja was dating someone.  Tony Rush.  He's one of the bouncers here.  They were on and off, but Tony is a good guy.  Can you point Tony out to me? He's not here today.  I really hope you catch the person who did this and put a bullet through his head.  That's not generally how we work, but I get where you're coming from.  Here, if you can think of anything to help, give me a call.  I will, Detective Quinn.    Joey.    Excuse me.  Joey.    Tell me you got the shooter.    Possibly.  One of the bouncers hasn't come to work since the murders.  Tony Rush.    How'd you know?   He and Kaja were an item.  Suspicious timing, don't you think? The sudden absence? Come on.  Hey.  You're gonna sleep in the bedroom.  I'm not gonna put you out.  Yes, you are.  I'm sleeping out here.  Deb, that's ridiculous.  This isn't a fucking pyjama party, Dex, okay? You're gonna take my bedroom and I'm gonna sleep out here on the couch.    Between me and the front door?   I will be by the door.  You've really thought this through.  Yeah, well, I found this website: \"How to cure a serial killer in ten easy steps. \" And this is the first step.  You'll have to print me out a copy.  I'm figuring this out as I go along, Dexter.  But if we're gonna do this, we're gonna do it all the way.  We're gonna eat together, we're gonna watch TV together we're gonna drive to fucking work together.  Hope you got a big shower.  Why don't you go unpack.  I'll heat us up something to eat.  You have to be completely honest with me.  That is the first rule.  My new code.  Don't you think Deb has gone through enough without you lying to her? I'm not lying.  You're a killer, Dex.  Deb didn't raise you.  I did.  She never saw what you were really like.  I did.  I was right to channel your urges instead of trying to suppress them.  You think I can just walk out of here and call the whole thing off? If it were this simple, watching you for 24 hours a day don't you think I would have tried it? Maybe you should've.  How does it feel? This need to kill? What do you call it? My dark passenger.  You make it sound like you're possessed or something.  That's how it feels sometimes.  Do you know how many assholes in prison blame their actions on someone or something else? I'm not copping a plea, Deb.  I'm giving you honesty.  It's rule number one, right? How's the spaghetti? Overcooked.  First rule.  So how does it feel? It starts with blood.  Blood? Yeah, the image of it trickling down the back of my eyelids.  The trickle becomes a stream and then a flood.  It fills me up all my empty spaces.  But then the blood isn't red anymore.    What is it?   It's black.  And pressing.  It feels like my head is gonna explode.  And the only way to relieve the pressure is to open the floodgates let it spill out.  I can't believe you're like this.  You're a sick fuck, Dexter.  Jesus Christ.  Well, maybe we shouldn't talk about it.  Yeah, maybe not while I'm serving fucking tomato sauce.  Are you seeing blood now? Nope, just spaghetti.  Well, if you start seeing red, will you fucking call me? And say what? \"Deb, I'm seeing blood\"? Say, \"I really feel like wrapping someone up in plastic and stabbing them. \" And I can say, \"No, Dexter, don't. \" Second rule.  There have to be families out there that are more fucked up than us.  But I sure as hell wouldn't wanna meet them.  What the fuck am I doing here?   What you think's right.    Right would be turning you in.  I'm doing this because I can't stand the idea of you living the rest of your life in prison.  Or worse.  I told Deb I'd be honest with her, but it's not like I'm stalking a kill.  I just need to get into Louis' penthouse and find out what he knows about me.  You Okay?   It's late.    Yeah.  I'm just doing some work.  I'll sit with you.  Deb, I'm fine.  No, you shouldn't be alone right now.  I mean, awake and alone.  Yeah, maybe I should try to get some sleep.  Just know that I'm here for you.  How could I forget? Now that Deb is my Siamese twin getting into Louis' penthouse is going to be next to impossible.  But how long can I wait? You know, for the tenth time I barely saw Kaja that night.  I was working.  She got off at 2 a. m.  and I don't know what she did after that.  Whatever you decide to get into after this, forget writing because you could not make up a story to save your fucking life.  Security tapes back him up.    Shit.  Are you sure?   No doubt.  He was at the club all night working.  Well, it looks like some of what you said wasn't bullshit.  You were working when Kaja was killed.  We still don't like the fact that you vanished the day after she died.  Smells like guilt to me.    You could have had someone do it.    No way.  What happened? She start sleeping around on you?   Kaja was loyal.    Loyal, huh? So she was doing you.  At least we're getting somewhere.  The problem is now we know you've been lying to us about you and Kaja.  And that's bad form, Tony.  We tend to get cranky when people bullshit us.  Now, if you think what we're doing to the club is bad wait till we start on you.  She was with Viktor.  Say again? The night that Kaja died she left the club with Viktor.    Fucking sleazebag.    Who the fuck is Viktor? Hey, how's it going out there? Don't ask.  Bad as you thought? Worse.  We sit in the sun waiting for the diggers to find a body.  I mean, so far they've uncovered a telephone cable and a bag of used diapers.  I mean, all this waiting around it's like dating a born again Christian.  If I don't have Deb watching my every move it'll be a lot easier to slip away to Louis' apartment.  I'm getting a little stir crazy.    I wouldn't mind a day out of the lab.    Dude.  Oh, my God, I would be eternally grateful.  But you'd have to clear it with your sister.  For some reason, she really wants me out there.    You think she secretly hates me?   I'll see what I can do.  Masuka's miserable on this whole Wayne Randall thing.  He's begging me to take over for him today.  Okay.  Great.  Great.  I'll drive.    You'll drive?   I could use some fresh air.  Let's go.    Just got a break on Mike's shooting.    What? The last person to see Kaja alive was Viktor Baskov.  He's a Russian expat.  We couldn't find anything on him in here but we got a hit on the Interpol database.  He's a member of the Koshka brotherhood.  Known for narcotics   and human trafficking.    Hold on.  I have to take care of this.  Are we good? Deb, I'll be surrounded by federal marshals.  I think I'll be okay.  It was 15 years ago.  Give me a fucking break.  Where are the bodies, Wayne? Closer to the road.    Why'd you tell us to dig here?   Because this place looks different.  Look at these mini malls.  You think I like being out here with you in the fucking heat?   All right.  Listen.  We're moving.    Damn.  Strike this.  One more wit, he'd be a fucking half wit.  God.  Oh, it's hot as a pig's asshole.  All this asphalt.  You know, this used to be a real pretty place.  Field.  Trees.  Now look at it.  Yeah, nothing stays the same.  That's the truth.  Well, at least the Frosty Swirl is still here.  You surprised a lot of people.    How's that?   Leading us to these bodies.  Why the change of heart? Why do you care? I'm just curious.  People say you grew a conscience.  It was always there.  It was just buried under a lot of Wayne Randall.  I just surrendered.    Surrendered?   All right.  Let's break for lunch.  We'll pick this up in an hour.  Oh, here we go.  Getting to Louis' penthouse and back in an hour will be tight but I'm not exactly flush with options.  I can appreciate the mind set of a collector but toys? Seems like a waste of a good obsession.  My charge card numbers? So Louis killed my credit cards.  Why is he messing with my life? It features 29 points of articulation five more than the last figure they put out so at least they're listening to the collectors.  Still, they could have   Idea: a video diary app.  One touch, device starts recording.  Tap again and it uploads directly to Still waiting.  Yeah, I'm almost done.  Your hour's almost up.  I'm only thinking of you.  Oh, God.  There'll never be an app for this.  Jesus.  This is going to be worse than Bob Henley.  He got off easy.  I want to see Dexter lying in his own piss and vomit and I won't stop until that represents the high point of his day.  No one fucks with me.  No one.  Now, on to more important things.  Four ninety   Bob Henley.  \"Henley arrested after the FBI found child pornography on his workstation.  Skanda tech has announced his dismissal pending charges which could fetch up to 15 years. \" Is this how Louis took control of his software company? By setting this guy up? What's he planning for me? With Deb on my case, I don't know when I'll have this chance again.    Why are you fucking with me, Louis?   God, please, don't hurt me.  Give me a good reason not to hurt you because right now I want to break your neck.    Why'd you send me the hand?   It was a stupid joke.  I just, you know, the lifelines, you know, time is short.  It was a clue.  I was screwing with you.  Why? Because I came to you for help with my game and you said no.  Your game? Yes, I swear that's the reason.  This is about your game? I spent five years on that game and you shit all over it.  And now I'm too depressed to even look at it.  It was my whole world! I never wanna see you again.  Work.  Jamie.  Do you understand? I'm done.  I'm totally done.  Where the fuck have you been? Running an errand.  What errand? Deb, I didn't kill anybody.  How the fuck do I know that? I've been calling you and calling you.    I didn't get the messages.    Well, check your fucking phone.  I need to know where you are at all times.    That is what we agreed on, right?   It won't happen again.  Finish what you need to do here and we'll go visit Harrison together.  Okay.  Here you are.  Seems you rode that wagon till the wheels came off.    Trouble in paradise?   No, she's my sister.  Also my boss.  Congratulations.  You just redefined hell.  What crawled up her ass? It's a long story.  Randall, what'd you mean earlier when you said \"surrendered\"? I just accepted my situation, you know of being where I am.  Prison.  People watching your every move.  It is what it is.  Once I stopped fighting it the anger just fell off like a bad scab.  Left me open to try and make things right.  They still use real ice cream.  At least everything hasn't gone to hell.  We're still not getting anywhere, George.  I mean, you must like us coming here.    There's nothing I can do about it.    Stop protecting Viktor Baskov.    I told you     Yeah, he doesn't work here.  Just comes in for a drink now and then.    That's all I know.    Right.  We'll see you soon.  I might even bring a portable polygraph next time.  You know how long it would take to poly everyone in here? Okay, everybody get your asses back to work.    Rough day?   lsaak.  Mr.  Sirko.  What are you doing here? I heard the police.  It would appear that I'm here for the same reason, to find Viktor.  Yeah, I swear I I have no idea how they got his name.  I'm sure of it.  But we'll get to that.  Anyway, I thought he was in Kiev with you.  If Viktor was in Kiev why would I be here? Viktor never made his flight.  I checked.  Well, I don't understand.  Where is he, then? Viktor's caused us some problems.  I won't deny it.  Shooting a policeman is never good for business.  I can't help but wonder if someone in the brotherhood decided to make an example of him.  Without your approval? No.  Oh, no.  Viktor was impulsive, yes.  He did a stupid thing, yes.  But he was one of us and we would always protect him.  You're in luck.  Why? I believe you.  I've had a long flight.  We have a lot to discuss.    Hello?   Hello, Joey? It's Nadia from the Fox Hole.  Yeah, how many Nadias do you think I know?   What's up?   My car won't start.  I was wondering if maybe you could give me a ride home tonight.  Yeah, sure.  What time do you get off?   Hey.    Hey.  We were just having a little dinner.  Look who's here.  Hey, bud, I missed you today.  How was school?   We had toy share.    Toy share?   Did you bring your train set?   Fire truck.    Fire truck beat out the train set?   Yes.  Oh, hey, Dex.  Just grabbing one for the road.  I know you don't like me being on this side but it's all right when Jamie's here, right?   Why not?   Sweet.  This is such a great place to hang out.  Right by the bay.    Yeah.    I love coming over here.  Well, I better get going.  I'll see you tomorrow.  And I'll catch you at work, right? Yeah.  He's not scared of me at all.  And he's not going to quit unless I stop him.  You're a lifesaver.  Not all cops are so nice to strippers.  To tell you the truth, I was hoping you had something more for me.    More for you?   About the murders.  What? You think this is just some ploy so I could get you alone and spill my guts? Look, I told you everything that I knew.  My car really did break down.  I'm sorry.    I could pay you for the gas.    Stop it.  It's fine.  It's the least I could do after all I'm costing you in tips.  You'll have to do a lot more than give me a lift to make up for that.  This is it.  On the left.  What'd you have in mind as far as compensation? I don't know.  Use your imagination.  Well, you're gonna have to give me a hint.  I'm very unimaginative.  Okay.  George says the problem with my car could be the transmission.  It means it's going to be in the shop for at least a few days.  Yeah.  Well, maybe you could pick up the bill.  I'd really appreciate it.  You're awfully quiet tonight.  Anything you wanna talk about? Anything I can do? Yeah.  What? Do you have any A 1? I think so.  Just enough for a good night's sleep.  That's all I need.    Success!   Thank you.  Just finishing what you started.  I promised Deb.  Hello? Where are you? Sorry.  I got here as fast as I could.  Almost drove off the road.  I'm so fucking tired.  What are you doing here? I snuck out of the house while you were asleep.    Dexter, what the fuck did you do?   Nothing.  I couldn't go through with it, but I wanted to.  I needed to.  I didn't care about anything else.  I lost control.  All I could see was blood.  All I could feel was the pressure in my head.  Fuck! It is too deep inside me.  Harry was right.  I am a monster.  You should arrest me.  You should take me in.  Get me off the street.  Dex.  Dad was wrong.  The fact that we're here tonight proves that you are in control.    But I wasn't.    But you stopped.  That's what's important.  It must've been so hard for you to call me but you did, and that's a huge step.  It makes me think maybe you can control this.  You really believe that? I didn't.  But maybe now I do.  What happened tonight is a good thing.  It was really, really good.  I'm not gonna give up.  And I'm not gonna let you give up.    Are you okay to drive?   No, I'm gonna stay with you.  I just need to be alone for a couple of minutes.  Nothing's gonna happen.  Okay.  You'll wake up with a headache.  Probably have a decent idea how you got here.  Maybe that's a good thing.  I still have to get you out of my life.  But not by taking yours.  What the fuck? Who the fuck are you? I'm your employer or rather, former employer.  I believe you recently gave notice.  Bullshit.  I work for George.  Well, worked.  And he works for me.  My name is Isaak.  I'm the owner of the Fox Hole chain of gentlemen's clubs amongst other enterprises.  What do you want'? It would appear that George neglected to do your exit interview.  It's company policy and I'm a stickler when it comes to rules.  You got to be kidding, right? Keeping good employees is essential to running a successful business.  Your feedback is important.  Would you mind telling me why you quit? Well, I trust it wasn't the hostile working environment.  No, I I just felt it was time to move on.  So it was nothing to do with the tragic death of one of our dancers? Kaja, I believe her name was.  Because if it did, I would completely understand.  It must have been quite a traumatic loss for you.  What do you mean? Yeah.  Maybe that's why you talked to the police.    No way.    I had you followed.  You know what? I didn't say a word.  I swear.  I lied.  I didn't have you followed.  You were just the most likely candidate.  You loved her, didn't you? What? Kaja.  You were in love with her.  It's nothing to be ashamed of.  It's the one thing that gives meaning in this life.  I would have done the same thing if I was in your position.  It's terrible to lose someone you love.  You still thinking about last night? Actually, I'm thinking about how much I could go for a Frosty Swirl.  That's good.  A sudden craving for sugar is good? If you're thinking about normal things then maybe you're becoming more normal.  I'm never gonna be normal, Deb.  Yeah.  None of us really are.  Where you going? I want a Frosty Swirl.  I'll bring you one.  She'll always be watching me, but maybe that's okay.  If Wayne Randall can make peace with his sentence who am I to complain? Especially considering the alternative.  Well, well.  Looks like you two are ready to eat each other's shit.  Oh, yeah.  We kind of patched things up.  I'm happy for you.  I never got to do that with Hannah.  It's Robin to my Batman.  I was never as alive as I was when I was with her.  Every day was like Christmas Day unwrapped present.  I wish I had a chance to tell her how I felt.  You can still tell her.  Yeah.  I'm afraid the clock has run out.  Damn.  I sure as fuck gonna miss that.  Hannah used to think I was something special.  Now she sees me as just a killer.  And you know what? She's not wrong.  There's just one last person I need to kill.  He never cared if anyone found the bodies.  He just wanted a couple of days of sunshine and Frosty Swirl.  Randall didn't change, and he couldn't take life in prison.  Can I?

Why did you send me the hand? I came to you for help with my game and you said no.  Your game? Kaja was dating someone.  Tony Rush.  He's one of the bosses here.  The night that Kaja died, she left the club with Viktor.  Viktor never made his flight.  I checked.  Well, I don't understand.  Where is he, then? You loved her, didn't you?   What?   Kaja.  Maybe that's why you talked to the police.  You know what? I didn't say a word.  This pretty face belongs to Wayne Randall.  Fifteen years ago, Randall and his teenage girlfriend went on a three state killing spree that ended here in Miami.  Hannah used to think I was something special.  Now she sees me as just a killer.  There's just one last person I need to kill.  Randall couldn't take life in prison.  Can I? Hey, excuse you.  I feel trapped, like there's no escape.  And it's not because I'm at the post office.  She's got me penned in like a caged animal.  And an animal is never more dangerous than when it's backed into a corner.  Dexter.  How much longer are you gonna be? We have a briefing in 20 minutes.  I'll be out in a minute, Deb.  Why do you look so guilty? Next.  I can't do anything about Deb but there's one irritation I can get rid of.  Louis.  The morning briefing.  It's the only time Deb's looking at everyone and not just me.  Let's get started.  Batista, where are we on the Mike Anderson investigation? Specifically with Baskov Fuckwad enov over here.  We're still chasing our tail.  BOLO turned up squat so if Baskov is still in the U. S. , he's gone way underground.  If he did manage to leave Okay, he's talking but why's she staring at you? All right, well, let's keep digging around the Russian expat community.  If Baskov is hiding out locally, then someone must be helping him.  The club's owned by Ukrainian business interests with ties to organised crime so I wouldn't count on anybody   getting too talkative.    She's still staring.  Is she mad at you? Moving on, Simms and Miller brought in a suspect on the I 95 shooting.  Dexter, I'm gonna need you to get a standard.  I'm definitely picking up a chill in her voice.  You fucked up, didn't you? You did.  You screwed the pooch.  We're coming up on the end of the month.  You guys are working open cases.  If you need help, anything I can do make sure you're asking for it.  We need to get our numbers down.  Okay.  You're under arrest.  The DNA swab isn't optional.  Fuck you.  I can get some uniforms to come in and hold your mouth open for you.  What's the matter, you too much of a pussy to do it yourself? No, I'm just on edge today.  You probably shouldn't push me.  I am quaking in my boots.  What the fuck? He was being very uncooperative.    He tried to kill me.    Shut the fuck up.  Get outside.  Help.  What the fuck is the matter with you?   You.  Watching me all the time.    Me? Living with you is driving me crazy.    I have to watch you, Dexter.    Why? When I had the urge to   I called you.  Didn't I? And you talked me down.  It worked.    Why can't you back off?   Can you promise if I wasn't on you you wouldn't slip? If you don't get off my ass, something bad is gonna happen.    What's that mean?   If I don't control my need   it's gonna control me.    I am trying to help you.    I am trying to help you control it.    No, you're trying to suppress it.  To lock it away.  But the lock is not gonna hold.  You saw what happened in there.  The only way I control it is to channel it the way Harry taught me.  No.  I do not accept that.  Dad was wrong.  I'm not so sure.  Sometimes I think he knew me better than I know myself.  Think about Harrison.  What you could be exposing him to.  I think about him all the time.  Sooner or later, this is gonna catch up to you and to him.  I'll give you some space.  I'll back off.  Just hang in there with me, okay? I can't go on like this, living by Deb's rules.  Ray Speltzer.  Just paroled for assault.  But there have been more serious charges.  Ann Feig disappeared after a date with Speltzer.  And another date, Nina Fleischer, turned up dead but the police couldn't make anything stick.  Did Nina lose her earring in the struggle? Speltzer will most likely kill again unless I take him out.  A groundskeeper in a cemetery.  That's appropriate.  But he didn't get those muscles pushing a lawnmower.  Speltzer's grown his hair, but he seems no less hostile.  ls Speltzer just blowing off steam or is this the ritual he goes through before he kills?   Hey, Deb.    Hey, what are you up to? I'm just trying out a new gym.    What's wrong with the old one?   Well, this one has a smoothie bar.  Yeah.  Look, I gotta go.  I wanna keep my heart rate up.  Thanks for checking in.    Nadia.    Hi, Joey.    What are you doing here?   I came to ask you a favour.  Another one? Oh, it's like giving milk to a stray cat.  Here, sit down.    I remind you of a dirty cat?   No, no.  I was trying to be clever, which is sort of out of my wheelhouse.  What can I do for you? Kaja was wearing a bracelet the night she was killed.  I know she would want to be buried in it.  It's the least I could do for my friend.  If it's been cleared for DNA, you can have it.  I got a list of her personal effects.  Here we go.  There's no bracelet listed.  Are you sure? I know she was wearing it that night.  I don't know what you're implying but I'm the only dirty cop in this station.  And I didn't take it $0 A dirty cop is better than a dirty cat.    I believe you.  Thanks.    Wait.  I was wondering if you'd like to go outwith me sometime.  Or you could come to my place and I'll make you dinner.  Why don't I cook you dinner? I was hoping you'd say that.  Did you see the list with your own eyes? Sit down.  No.  How do you know the detective wasn't lying about the bracelet? Because he likes me.  He likes you? Do you understand what's at stake here? If the cops find that dead GPS chip in that bracelet they're gonna figure out we use them to track our mules.    And if they get on to our system     They'll shut down your heroin business.  Which is a lot more lucrative than the tits and ass business, Nadezhda.  George maybe you should accept good news when you hear it.  Your name is Nadezhda, but you go by Nadia.  I always hated Nadezhda.  You shouldn't.  It's a beautiful Russian name.  Did you know that the greatest mezzo soprano of the Bolshoi Theatre was also named Nadezhda?   No.    Nadezhda Obukhova.  It was said that her voice could unlock the mysteries of the heart.  She died before I was born but I still listen to her recordings of The Snow Maiden.  My music teacher, Mr.  Chillich he said to me, \"lsaak, you think you're strong but you are not strong if you don't feel. \" He gave me an F so I pushed him down a flight of stairs.  I felt bad about it.  After that, my father shipped me off to a disciplinary school in England.  Now I'm afraid my love of opera is all that's left of my sensitive side.  I want you to get close to this detective.  Find out what the police know about Viktor.  You'll do that for me, won't you, Nadezhda? Good.  You can go now.  Viktor is smart.  He probably took the bracelet to keep the police from getting it.  He probably has it and is hiding out somewhere.  But we'll never know because the signal died over a week ago.  With technology, there's always a way.  Find the IT man who set the system up.  If we can track the bracelet we can find Viktor.  So she called and I said, \"Okay, let's do a double dater. \" Five p. m. , we're laying down there on the couch and I feel this hand kind of go up my back.  This is what my life has become? Time to start prying one monkey off my back.  Got a package here addressed to Miami Metro forensics.  Oh, yeah, I'll take it.    There you go.    Thanks.  I think I drunk ordered from the Hustler store and that never turns out well.  What the fuck? \"Dear Mr.  Greene, when I bought the Ice Truck Killer's hand I assumed it would be in mint condition, not with lines over its palm.  Please refund my money immediately. \" You had the hand the whole time? And you sold it online?   No, I swear     After all I've done for you you stab me in the fucking back?   You are so fucking fired.    Vince.  You gotta   Out.  Now.  I have the worst luck with interns.  One more step and Louis will be out of my life for good.  Now to focus on where I can find Speltzer next.  Lieutenant, I have someone here who'd like to speak to you.  This is Donna Randall.  Wayne's mama.  The one who suicided out there on the highway.  Ms.  Randall, I'm so sorry for your loss.  How can I help you? It's me might be able to help you.  I got some stuff here that might interest you.  Wayne sent it to me 15 years ago, just before he got caught.  He said it was some sentimental items and would I hold it for him till he got settled someplace away from the law.  Ms.  Randall, why didn't you turn this over years ago? Look, I know my boy did wrong but I wasn't about to help the state of Florida kill him.  Anyway, now that he's gone I figured maybe something in there might help bring some peace to the families, you know, of the victims.  It's mostly just junk that Wayne and that girl collected on their little tear.  There was some cash in there too but I spent that ages ago.  It might be a waste of time but have the lab go over it.  Just when you think a case is closed, it pops open again.  Another book of matches from Stuckey's.  You would think one memory of that place would be enough.  Anything interesting? Not so far.  One tightly wrapped young woman's T shirt.  And inside, we have a little plastic giraffe.  And a lighter.  And a necklace.  It looks like more of the same but why was that stuff wrapped up? Maybe they have a special meaning.  \"Janice. \" Name of the woman Randall said he killed.    Might be a trophy.    Means Wayne was telling the truth.  Her body must be buried out there someplace.  If the giraffe and lighter are trophies too there might be more bodies.  I just got a call.  The bouncer from the Fox Hole, Tony Rush they found him with a screwdriver through his head.  We just interviewed him.  The Koshka Brotherhood were trying to send a message about oops.  Just got that much harder to find who killed Mike.  No matter what we do, there's always another body.  Yo, Mary Poppins, wait up.  Deb, I'm not gonna be home for dinner tonight.  I'm gonna hit the new gym.  Hey, babe.  What's going on? I'm just watching a video.  Wanna see it? Idea: a video diary app.  One touch, device starts recording.  Tap again and it uploads directly to   Still waiting.  Yeah, I'm almost done.  Your hour's almost up.  I'm only thinking of you.  Oh, God.  There will never be an app for this.  That was before we started dating.  You're wearing the shirt I gave you for your birthday, asshole.  It was a hooker.  It's not cheating if you pay for it.  Oh, my God, you are a pig.  If I catch anything from you, I'm gonna kill you.  How did you get that disc? It was mailed to me anonymously, probably by your hooker.    What did you do, cancel her cheque?   Dexter sent it.  Dexter? He broke into your apartment and he stole your porno? Yeah, and he just got me fired.  He's trying to ruin my life.  You are fucking crazy.  I don't ever wanna see you again.  Fuck! Gym, huh? Lying little shit.    Morgan.    Ordered you a beer.  You knew I was following you.  I made it easy for you.  You lured me here.    Yeah.    Here you go.  Little attitude adjuster.  Think I'm gonna need a little more adjusting.  What's this about?   Do you remember this case?   Yeah.  Ray Speltzer, he was guilty as fuck probably of two murders but we couldn't prove it.  I think he's getting ready to do it again.    What are you talking about?   He shaved his head today.  His head had been recently shaved when he was questioned about Ann Feig's disappearance and when he was arrested for Nina Fleischer's murder.  I think it's part of his killing ritual.  I think he's hunting his next victim right now.  How the fuck would you know that? Christ on a fucking cracker, Dexter.  You got me here to help you stalk Speltzer   so you could kill him?   I don't need you to help me.    I just need you to understand     Goddamn it.    Deb, sit down.    This is not what we agreed to.    You fucking lied to me.    Not here.  Come on.  Get the fuck off.  Deb, I lured you here because I thought maybe if I let you in on my process you'd appreciate that there is some value to what I do.  I don't believe this.  You want my approval? I wanna continue to be honest with you, Deb.  I have to be free to be who I am.  It is a capital of fence to be who you are, Dexter.  I'm taking out the trash.  Trash that would otherwise be left to putrefy.  I know I've said this, but there is a legal system for that.  Speltzer got off.  That doesn't mean it doesn't work.  If it worked as well as you think it does, I wouldn't be so busy.  Dad knew that.  Dad taught me that.  What is it about your personal law that is so much better than the one that the rest of us agree to live by?   Sometimes it is.    How? Speltzer would have to murder somebody for you to arrest him.  I can stop him.  Are you trying to tell me that's why you do this, so you can save lives? End result is the same.  Some girl is gonna be dead soon   if I don't take Speltzer out.    Based on what fucking evidence, Dexter? A haircut? Dexter, you can't kill people   you think might murder.    That is not how I do things.  You can't prove that he killed Nina Fleischer.  I will.  I'm not done vetting him yet.    Vetting?   I am trying to tell you that I will not kill Speltzer until I am absolutely sure that he is guilty.  Oh, fuck.  No.  I This is done.  And nothing better happen to that bald piece of shit over there.  I'm not done with Speltzer.  I've been out roaming free and I like it.  I just have to find the proof that will convince Deb.  Speltzer went in that mausoleum Since when does a groundskeeper keep the grounds inside a private tomb? Why is this mausoleum so special? The last body interred here was over 50 years ago.  If it was a friend of Speltzer's, then Ray is holding up really well.    Hey, Deb.    Why aren't you at work?   I'm kind of in the middle of     I need you.  Okay, okay.  Yeah, I'll be right there.    Now, Dexter.    Bye.  What's up? Fortunately, we set up a secure cloud framework that syncs up to the receivers.  You're able to reconstruct the GPS tracking points? Now get to the point, the bracelet.  Chip kept moving after the girl was dead.    Where?   Viktor's apartment.    And from there?   Miami airport.  Then a marina.  Then eight miles out to sea, where the signal stopped.  Maybe he took a boat offshore to avoid the police   and then he threw the bracelet     He's dead.  He was dumped in the ocean like a load of garbage.  Whoever killed him left from this marina.  Can you pinpoint the exact slip? I'll need some time.  It's worth the wait.  Okay, I'm here.  You don't have to fire me.  Tell me you weren't stalking Ray Speltzer.  I was at the cemetery where he works as a groundskeeper.  Goddamn it, Dexter.  He was lingering inside a mausoleum, treating it like it was sacred ground.  I think he's hiding something in there   something that may prove his guilt.    \"I think he may. \" That's not evidence.  I'd already have the evidence if you hadn't ordered me back here.  But even without it, I can tell Speltzer's gonna kill again.  An alarm is going off inside my lizard brain.  Great, now my brother has a lizard brain.  The amygdala.  The most primitive part of the brain that senses danger.    Harry taught me to listen to mine.    You'll excuse me if I don't put my faith in your amygdala.  But you already have, Deb, dozens of times.  All the murderers I've helped you catch who got brought down because of my hunches.  My lizard brain has been your secret weapon all along.  You just didn't know it.    You're fucking with my head.    Don't take it on faith.  I'll give you proof.  I'll go break into the mausoleum right now.  No.  If you're right and get the evidence illegally   then I can't use it in court.    That doesn't make it any less true.    Which is why you need to let me do it.    No, we follow the law, remember? I'll get a search warrant.  If evidence is there, I'll put him away before he can hurt anyone.  You're not listening.  There isn't time.  I just said that I will take care of this.  Do not fuck with me on this, or I swear to God I will take us both down.  Am I being clear this time?   Yeah, that's pretty clear.    Good.  Now I have a job for you.  I need you to go with Batista to visit Hannah McKay.    What?   Randall's sidekick from his killing spree.  If we're gonna find those bodies, we need her help.  That's the detective's job.  Why do I go? I need her DNA.  She was a minor at the time of the crime so she was able to get her record expunged.  You're giving me work to keep me away from Speltzer.  It's important we find those bodies.  And yes, I am trying to keep you away from Speltzer.    Dexter, ready to roll?   Yeah.  We just gotta make a quick stop on the way.  You piece of shit.  I know what you people did to Tony Rush.  Excuse me.  You wanna talk to me? How about we do it in my office? You're making me nervous.  Why don't you sit down?   I'm waiting for someone.    Aren't we all? Doesn't mean we can't enjoy ourselves in the meantime.  Have a drink, or a lap dance or festoon a thong with neatly folded dollar bills.  Yeah, I'm fine.  So you're not interested in alcohol or looking at naked women.  You may be in the wrong place.  I could say the same of you.  What brings you here?   Me? I'm looking for something.    Aren't we all?   So we're both here just killing time.    Yeah, that's exactly what I'm doing.  Killing time.  Ironic, isn't it? We're both here for a different reason than these other leering cretins and yet the net result is the same.  And what's that? We're frustrated.  Let's go.  I hope you find what you're looking for.  So Hannah McKay.  Were you around for the spree killings? I was still in uniform but I remember it pretty well.  Hannah was, like, 15 when she ran off with Randall.  She wasn't in on the murders, just a kid who fell for the wrong guy.  She testified against him for a reduced sentence.  Did six years in juvie.  Since she got out, she's laid low.  Now she owns this nursery.  Sounds like she really managed to change her life.  Yeah, I think I envy her.    What do you mean?   I don't know.  Since Mike's death, I've been thinking maybe there's more to life.  I used to think murder police was it.  Maybe there's something else out there for me.  Something new and exciting.  And sometimes there's nothing more exciting than getting back what you had and lost.  Can I help you?   Ms.  McKay?   That's right.  Sergeant Batista, Miami Metro.  I'd like to talk to you about Wayne Randall.  What a surprise.  He's the detective.  What are you?   Lab geek.    This just gets better and better.  I'm sorry, I'm a sergeant and this is Dexter Morgan.  He's a forensic analyst.  I've said everything I have to say about Wayne Randall.  It was a long time ago and I just wanna put it behind me.  Ma'am, this is very important.  Now, I could bring you in to the station house but I'd rather not put you out if I don't have to.  Fine.  But I have work to do.  So you know nothing about these other people that Wayne claimed to have killed and buried?   How is that possible?   We weren't joined at the hip.  I don't know what he did when I wasn't with him.  Careful.  The leaves are sharp.  How do you stand this humidity? If it bothered me, I'd be growing cacti.    Are we done?   Not quite.  Wayne's mother recently brought in a bag of mementos   from your time together.    Lovely woman.  Mind taking a look at these photos and letting me know if you recognise anything? Yes.  Yes, I would mind, detective.    Sergeant.    Sergeant, I'm sorry.  Look, I feel terrible about what happened back then.  It's something that I have to live with for the rest of my life and I deserve that.  But the only way that I have been able to survive is to move on with my life.  What about the families of the victims? Don't you think they deserve some closure? Absolutely, but they're not gonna get it from me.  I've told you everything that I know.  Now I would appreciate it if you would both just leave me alone.  Fine.  But before we go, my colleague has to get a DNA sample   from you to exclude     I understand.  I understand more about police work than I care to.  You wanna show me that court order in your back pocket, Mr.  Morgan? Dexter's fine.  If I were you, I'd stick with \"Mr.  Morgan. \" Please be quick.  I Will.  If you don't mind, I'm gonna go and crank up the AC in the car.  Nice to meet you, Ms.  McKay.  All right, I'm just gonna get a quick swab from your cheek.  This won't hurt.  But then you probably know that.  Shit.  You do this for a living? Sorry.  Okay.  That should do it.  Thanks, Ms.  McKay.    Hannah.    No, you were right.  I think we should keep things on a last name basis.  How would you like to catch this fuck? Ray Speltzer.    I still lose sleep over this one.    He's hiding something in a mausoleum that might connect him to Nina Fleischer's murder.  I can't get Judge Perez to sign a warrant so I need you to wet the wheels a little bit.  What was your probable cause? There's some circumstantial stuff.  It's thin but basically, Speltzer is setting off an alarm in my lizard brain.  Interesting.  So you'll talk to Perez? No, not on behalf of your lizard brain.    I know it sounds fucked up.    Look, Debra I think you're a good cop.  If you think this is worth pursuing, I trust you but that's not gonna get you a warrant.  Tried getting permission from the family   who owns the mausoleum?   I can't track them down.    Stay on it.  You'll find someone.    If you knew there was a murderer and you could do something to stop him before he killed could you let it go? We're the police, Debra.  We have to follow the law.  You could put a patrol car on Speltzer.  Watch him.  But I better not see it on the budget.  That one.  Nice boat, you arrogant asshole.  Too bad it won't be afloat too long.  Kiss my ass, you ginger freak.  Is this your boat? Yeah, this is my boat.  That's why I'm on it.  Who are you? Are you a cop or some kind of security? Who are you? I don't have to tell you anything.  Show me a badge.    Why did you kill Viktor?   What? What are you talking about?   Hey, just get the fuck out of here.    I want answers.  I will call the cops   I am gonna put your eyes out.  Now, the trick is, to keep from drilling into your brain.  Look, look, I don't Look, I don't know anything.  Look, I didn't kill anyone.  I swear.  This isn't even my boat.  Why did you say it was? It belongs to this douchebag named Dexter Morgan.  I hate this guy's guts.  I came down so I could sink his boat.    Who is Dexter Morgan?   Like I said, he's just a jerk who works for Miami Metro Homicide.  Now, can I please go? Yes.  Get rid of him.    Morgan.    Lieutenant.  This is Officer Hewitt.  We followed Speltzer home.  There's been no activity for over two hours.  Seems like he's in for the night.  We just got dispatched on a 211.  Can we take it? Or do you want us to stay on Speltzer? Negative on Speltzer.  Take the 211.    Copy that.  Good night, lieutenant.    Good night.  This is a waste of fucking manpower.  My father worked sometimes three jobs to take care of us so I decided the best way I could help was to leave home so he has one less mouth to feed.  He'd be so ashamed if he knew what I do to make money.  Hey.  You're not gonna be stripper your whole life, right? No, I have big dreams.  I want to start my own dog walking business.  No matter what happens, rich people will always be lazy and they will always have dogs.  What's wrong? I like you, Joey.  I don't want to lie to you.  About what? My bosses at the club they ordered me to get close to you so I could find out what the police know about Viktor Baskov and their business dealings.  So that's why you said yes to the date? No, I said yes before they told me to do this.    So then you do really like me?   Yes.  But I'm scared.  These men are dangerous.  I can't go back to them with nothing.  Don't be scared.  I'm not gonna let anything happen to you.  Look maybe there's a way we could help each other out.  What do you mean? Well, I could give you enough information   to keep your bosses happy.    What if the other cops find out? They won't.  And, in return, if you hear anything around the club about Mike Anderson's murder you pass it along to me.  I can do that.  I'm still worried for you.  You should not get involved with the Koshka Brotherhood.  Don't worry about me.  If I can protect you and catch a cop killer it's worth sticking my neck out a little.  It is a nice neck.  Hey, Ray.  I got off work early thought I'd take you up on your offer.  Well, you will not be disappointed.  I make the best mojito in Miami.  Awesome.  Looks like Speltzer's taken over the family shrine.  Nina Fleischer's missing earring.  She didn't lose it in the struggle.  Speltzer took it as a trophy.  If I take it, he'll know I was here.  But I can still show it to Deb.  No cell service in a mausoleum.  Goddamn it.  This is Dexter.  Leave a message.  Dex, it's me.  I just wanna let you know I'm gonna be late getting home tonight.  You've got me paranoid about Speltzer so I'm gonna drive by his house make sure he's tucked in for the night.  Thank you for fucking up my evening, bro.  So how long did you say you've been here? A few days.  I promise I'm going furniture shopping this weekend.  I mean, you could have at least taken the plastic off.  I'll get around to it.  Have a seat.  Okay.    How about some music?   Soon.  Sit tight.  I'll be right back.  I'll get us a drink.    Ray.    Yeah? I gotta be honest with you.  This mojito sucks.  There's, like, no alcohol in it.  Well, you have to be in control of your faculties.  Otherwise, there's no challenge.  Well, you certainly are confident.  You look strong.  Thanks.  I guess.  I like it when they're strong.  What are you talking about? Let's play a game.  Night night, fuckface.  Hey, Dex, it's me.  I just wanna let you know I'm gonna be late getting home tonight.  You've got me paranoid about Speltzer.  Gonna cruise by, make sure   Shit.    he's tucked in for the night.  Oh, my God.  Oh, God.  Freeze! Oh, fuck!   Deb.    Motherfucker.  He has a girl in here.  We have to find her.  Beat the shit out of her.  Speltzer took her earring as a trophy, just like he did with Nina Fleischer.  I found hers at the mausoleum.  Put a BOLO out on Speltzer but there's nothing yet.  House was a foreclosure that he broke into to set up his fucked up maze.  We found burned plastic in the oven.  Explains why there weren't any prints or DNA on the things we found.  I sent some unis over to the mausoleum and the door was open.  Nina Fleischer's earring was missing.  I think he's in the wind.  Behind you.  Oh, you're up early.  The coffee is fresh, if you want.  You were right.  If I'd let you do things your way, Speltzer would be dead.  That girl would be alive.  But he's out there, free to kill again.  Well, you can't change the way you think overnight.  I haven't.  I mean, I have but I haven't.  I get it.  What you do.  I hate it but I get it.  So you accept it? I understand it.  I understand that it might be Might be a necessary evil.  But what I don't understand are the blood slides.  They're trophies.  They're like Speltzer's earrings.    I'm nothing like Speltzer.    But on some level, Dexter you like to kill.  I like the way it makes me feel.  Same thing.  Deb, I can't change who I am.  I know.  And I can't change who I am.  What are you saying? I don't know what I'm saying.  But I think you should move out.  I think you should move back to your place.  Okay.  Deb I'm still your brother.  Nothing's changed.  Everything's changed.  I don't know if it can ever be the same again.  I'm finally out of my cage.  But freedom comes with a cost.      Previous EpisodeNext Episode"

So you're not interested in alcohol or looking at naked women.  You may be in the wrong place.  I'm taking out the trash that would otherwise be left to putrefy.  There is a legal system for that.  If it worked as well as you think it does, I wouldn't be so busy.  Just gonna get a swab from your cheek.  You do this for a living? Well, I hate it, but I get it, what you do.  But what I don't understand are the blood slides.  They're trophies.  They're like Speltzer's earrings.  I'm nothing like Speltzer.  My bosses at the club, they ordered me to get close to you.  These men are dangerous.  I can't go back to them with nothing.  I'm not gonna let anything happen to you.    He's gone.    Motherfucker.  He has a girl in here.  We have to find her.  She's dead.  Just when it seems like Deb and I are making progress we take a left turn.  I showed her a monster, Ray Speltzer a killer who chased his victim through a maze.  I could have prevented that murder, and Deb accepts that.  But she hasn't accepted me what I am.  And I'm not sure she ever will.  I'm getting nothing.    You?   No.  That maze man, he's good.  He knows what he's doing.  My hat's off to any killer good enough not to leave any DNA at a murder scene.  Plenty of his DNA in this place though.  Well, if this cemetery was his office, it's like this place was his break room.  Something was here.  Something special.  Like a trophy maybe? From one of his victims.  Killers hate to leave their trophies behind.  That means Speltzer stopped by here after he killed that girl.  But there's none of her DNA here.  No blood, no fibres, no hair.  No reception.  Speltzer is loose in the world and Deb will do everything in her power to find him.  But will she and I be able to find our way back to each other? Deb.  Will you? Will you be mine?   Morning.    Coffee.  Now.    Rita.    Another left turn.    Trinity killed her.    Yes.    Yes.    Why? She didn't fit the pattern at all.  Because I was coming after him.  So while we were hunting Trinity, you were too.  I figured out who he was before you did.  And you didn't help us get him? He knew who I was, where I lived, that I had a family.    I was trying to protect them.    You wanted to fucking kill him.  And I did.  When?   He's dead.  That's what matters.    When? I took care of him.    Did you love her?   Why would you ask that? Because I have no idea what's the truth and what's a lie with you.    I loved her.    If you were concerned about family then why were you going after Trinity? Is that what a loving husband does?   Are you even capable of love?   I love you.  How? How can you love me and also love to   ? It's how I've lived my whole life.  Before you walked into that church did you ever question the way I felt about you?   Why is it any different now?   Why? Jesus, Dexter.  Morgan.  Okay.  That was Batista.  They found Speltzer.  A security guard spotted him at the scrap yard.  And he had the good sense not to be a hero.    It took four officers to take Speltzer.    He put up a fight.  Came close to shooting.  If Speltzer had a weapon, they would've.    Speltzer is a weapon.    He was mine.  He hasn't asked for a lawyer.  This is your one shot.  A confession is our only shot.  He was wearing a mask so I couldn't make an ID that would stick.  Can't believe DNA wasn't at the scene.  Masuka and I went over it twice.  Yeah, Dexter and I, we checked Speltzer's mausoleum man cave for evidence of his victim there, but no luck.  Dexter and I can't make the evidence appear.  If you don't get a confession, you won't get Speltzer.  Are you two ready? Fuck,yes.    That's Dexter Morgan.    His face.  It looks familiar.  I put everything Jurg dug up on Morgan in there.  He's not a cop.  He's a lab rat.    Blood splatter.    It's spatter.  Blood spatter.  Whatever.  He's from Miami.  Normal guy.  Except his wife was murdered by a serial killer a few years back.  The man we killed on the boat? Louis Greene.  He was an intern for Miami Metro.  The boat's owner, this Dexter Morgan.  He works for Miami Metro too.  Viktor's death.  Is it payback for killing that detective? Viktor fucked us real good here.  Of all the people he could've shot, it had to be a fucking cop.    So it's Viktor's fault he's dead?   Yeah.  He was a loose cannon.  Never listened.  At least not to me.  Everything was going great until he showed up in Miami.  Viktor was a good man.  He was loyal.  He was committed.  And he was here to do what you couldn't.  Keep the Colombians from taking over our traffic!   Fuck.    Gentlemen.  Let's go.  Get up.  And here we go again.    Why?   Come over here, please.  Good afternoon, everyone.  I'm Detective Quinn.  I'll be your pain in the ass for the day.  Can we get that music turned off? Ladies to the left, customers to the right.  Keep it behind the bar.  Ma'am, I need you to go ahead and stand over there.    Officer.    It's detective.  Detective Quinn.  Do not tell me you are fucking her.  No.  What makes you think that? You're not the only one who's a detective.  You really think a stripper's a good idea? No, it's a horrible idea.  Seriously, how long is this gonna go on? I'm thinking every day until we lock up Mike Anderson's shooter.  Or you could say a number.  It'll be just like old times.  You leave your car unlocked you'll find some cash, maybe some blow.  All this goes away.  I don't know what you're talking about.  Get the fuck out of my face.  None of this makes any sense.  Viktor's dead.  They got him.  Not everyone at Miami Metro knows this.  Otherwise, they wouldn't be here.  Maybe this Morgan and Greene were working alone.  Why the fuck would these two assholes cover up Viktor's murder? I believe Dexter Morgan knows why.  Well, say the word.  I'll take him out.    No.  I wanna talk to him.    Talk? Hey, what are we supposed to do in the meantime? We got two boats waiting to drop off our supply even though we can't move what we already have.  We are bleeding money.  The bartender, Alex.  One of ours, isn't he? Yeah.  So let's give them what they want.  For my money, four on one is not really a fair fight.  I did a little boxing myself back in the day.  I didn't take on four cops, but, you know, I held my own.  You don't wanna chitchat.  I get that.  Here's the thing though.  My lieutenant is gonna come in here and say that she saw you at the maze where that waitress died.    Don't know what you're talking about.    Right, guy like you was at the gym.  But she's a woman.  They get shit wrong all the time.  And this one, man, she's my boss.  If you can believe that.  I have to fucking answer to her skinny ass every day.  And she's always squawking at me, you know? Her beak is, \"Squawk, squawk, squawk. \" To tell you the truth, I envy you.  I've been wanting to pop my lieutenant in that beak of hers for years.  She's dying to get a shot at you.  Should we let her? Could be fun.  Right?   Nice job in there.    He's all ready for you.  Deb.  Good luck.  He was mine, but Deb needs this more than me.  And she needs to get him her way.  Remember me? I saw you just the other night.  That is some maze that you built.  What is it for, Ray? Are you sure you don't remember me? Maybe I'm not pretty enough.  Your morn sure was pretty.  She died a few years ago, right? Cast a long shadow, I bet.  Hard for any girl to measure up to those looks but you keep trying, don't you? What do you think about the girls that go home with you? That they're stupid? Easy? That they're whores? They'd have to be, right? To go home with you, take their clothes off for you.  Girls like that are vulgar.  But girls like that sure do look like your mom.  So I have to wonder.  Your morn was so pretty.  She probably had a lot of admirers, right? Men that would go home with her and watch her take her clothes off? And then take her any way that they wanted her? Shut up.  There are many ways to break a body down.  You could hear it, couldn't you? You could hear her through those thin walls that the two of you shared.  You could hear how much she loved getting fucked by all those men.  You could hear her kissing them.  All the things that she might do with her mouth that same mouth that she would kiss you with.  But be honest, Ray.  You kind of liked it, didn't you? Weren't you kind of wishing that it was you inside her? I should've killed you like I killed that other bitch! Go to hell.  We got him.    Way to go, lieutenant.    Good job.  Congratulations.  Hey, Deb.  Jamie said she was good to watch Harrison till late tonight if you wanna grab a drink or something.  I thought you'd be in the mood to celebrate.  I'm really glad we got Speltzer, but celebrate? No.  Melanie Garrett is still dead.  But you got Speltzer.  He'll never hurt anyone again.    Well, outside of prison.    Dexter.  I've been thinking a lot about Rita.  About how she died.  She died because of you.  Because you were selfish.  You have a son.  Harrison is three years old.    Someone needs to protect him.    I do.  Someone needs to protect him from you.  He could go live with Astor and Cody.    With their grandparents in Orlando.    I am a good father.  I am the right person.  The only person who can and should raise my son.  Who, like me, lost his mother.  It is not fair of you to expose a child to your life choices.    You have to decide.  Your desires or     No, I don't.  You said it yourself, Dexter, that you can't stop, that you don't wanna stop.  And if you keep doing this, you're like a fucking magnet.  Bad shit is gonna find you.  And if that happens, I'll handle it.  What if you had been three minutes later to Speltzer's fucking maze?   But I wasn't.    You were too late for Rita.  I should've killed Trinity the first time I saw him.    That's the mistake I made.    That's the mistake? Yes! And I will never, from this moment on   Do you hear me? I will never ever make that mistake again.  It is not in your control.  Everything is in my control.  I am not giving up my son.  Mr.  Sirko, George.  I wasn't expecting visitors.  That's all right.  We don't stand on ceremony here.  Have a seat, Alex.  You have a beautiful family.  Thank you.  That is why I came here.  They are still in Kursk.  Your son and daughter, what are their names? My son's Zakhary and my girl, her name's Yulia.    They're twins, yes? How old?   Five.    Their birthday's in April.    Wow, five.  That's the best age.  Learning to read, walking, seeing the world and yet, they still want to be held.  You're probably wondering why I stopped by.  Well, you see Tell me, how much money do you send back to Kursk each month?   From your job at The Fox Hole?   Seven hundred fifty dollar.  I take out only my rent, my food, some money for my car.  A sacrifice for you, I'm sure.  But still, it's not very much.  What if your family could have a lot of money? Security.  College for Zakhary and Yulia?   You'd want that for them.    I would give anything for them.  That pleases me.  Because that is why I came by here today.    To ask you a favour, Alex.    Yes, of course.  Anything.  I have a problem.  One of my men killed a police officer and I have to give the police a suspect so they'll stop harassing us.    And that suspect is you.    But I didn't kill anyone.    Sure, you did.    I want you to write a note.  Pen, paper? This is what I want you to write.  Kaja I cannot live with what I have done.  I'm very sorry.  I will take care of your family now.  Zakhary and Yulia will want for nothing.  That's for you.  It's the gun that killed the police officer.  What do I do with it? Bang.  Look at your children's faces.  They're looking at you.  Wanting you to give them the best life this world has to offer.    You will do this for them.    And if I don't? We'll kill you anyway.  And throw your wife and fucking kids in the river.  No need for threats.  We're all friends here.  But I think you understand the situation.  You won't feel a thing.  It'll be quick.  Like turning off a light.  For my family? Hannah McKay.  She spent six years in juvie after pleading guilty to being Wayne Randall's accomplice.  She always claimed she was just another one of his victims.  Wayne called her the Robin to his Batman but with better legs.  Dexter Morgan.  You look a little lost.  Well, I haven't been inside a police station in 15 years.  Still smells the same, like fast food and sweat.  Hospitality isn't exactly our main concern.  I heard the sheriff's department found the body of one of Wayne's victims.  Yeah, they went back one last time after Wayne died.  And expanded the perimeter.  Is that what you're doing here? To help us find the other bodies Wayne buried? My lawyer said it was for the best.  There's a rumour going around that you were the last person to talk to Wayne before he died.  His last words were about you.  He said something about every day being like an unwrapped present.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I remember when he got that fortune from a cookie.  You two didn't stay in contact? Too painful.  Where were you and Wayne going anyway? Or was there a plan? Not much of one at first.  We were just trying to get out of Clopton, Alabama which isn't even a town.  It's an intersection and a cemetery.  But somewhere around Sarasota, a plan did begin to form.  Argentina.  We were gonna go find a farm in Argentina and settle down.    What?   We were living on farms in Alabama like somehow it would all be so different in South America.  Do you miss him? I miss the way I felt with him on the road.  That life was just beginning, and that anything Anything was possible.  You know the feeling? No.  It's my lawyer.  I'm sure he's wondering where I got lost to.  We have a big problem.  Get down.  Stay down there.    What's the problem?   Watch the Miranda.  Put him on the fucking car.  You know how this goes.  If you want an attorney we'll get one for you, even if you can't afford one.  Do you understand your rights? Do you understand? Did you guys see that? Looks like a yes to me.  Fucking cocksucker.  Never got confirmation that Speltzer understood his rights.    No.    But Speltzer fucking nodded.  He didn't say yes.  And at Speltzer's arraignment, his PD was able to make the case   Don't.    that because Speltzer was knocked unconscious, it is possible that he did not understand his rights.  That it wasn't a nod.  That it was a temporary blackout.  And the judge fucking bought that? The judge threw his confession out of court.    He walked.    When?   Two hours ago.    Motherfucker.  And apparently, Speltzer's planning to file a lawsuit against us.  Use of excessive force?   I don't believe this.    So all that's left to do is   ls what?   Yeah, we     We'll wait till he kills someone else?   There's nothing else we can do.    But there is something I can do.    Fuck that.  Fuck all of this.  The bartender from The Fox Hole blew his brains out last night.  Why don't they wear uniforms? There's no respect.  You would never know they were police.  Unless you knew who you were looking for.  We got a single gunshot wound to the right temple what appears to be GSR on the right hand.  It was through and through.  Based on the height of the bullet in the wall Alex was sitting at the table.  He put his gun to his head.    We got a White Russian on ice.    Very funny.  I'll have you know I have a major following on Twitter.  This gun is a 9 mil.  Same type of weapon used on Mike Anderson.  I'll go to Ballistics and run this through.  And confirm this turd is our shooter.  But I know that Viktor killed Mike Anderson.  Why would Alex take the fall for him? Unless there's someone at the club who wants the investigation to end as much as Miami Metro does.  Quinn, read that note again.  \"Kaja, I cannot live with what I have done.  I am very sorry. \"   Sorry to Kaja?   Yeah.  It makes sense.  It's obvious this Alex Dubrozny had feelings for her.  And she was in love with Tony.  Which probably didn't sit very well with him.  So he kills her, kills Tony and Mike was just in the wrong place at the wrong time.  I mean, this guy still has pictures up of his kids, his wife.  Yeah, he probably feels horrible having to look at her face all day.  That's just it.  He doesn't have to.  Take the pictures down.  Put them away.  Leaving the pictures up tells me he cares for them.  He's a guy.  Once something's up, why bother taking it down?   I don't know.    What don't you know?   I don't know if it all adds up.    Look.  We'll talk to the neighbours.  See if they saw anyone coming in or out of Alex's apartment   if it'll make you happy.    It's not about happy.  Angel.  Angel, this is our fucking guy.  Everyone yearns for clarity, for closure.  But is that ever really possible?   Jamie?   Harrison's outgrown half these toys.  I know we had to go through them.  Didn't know it was gonna be now.  I'm almost done.  I wanted to do it while he's asleep.  Anything we're unsure about, we can put in the keep for now pile.    What's the other pile?   Trash.    You put Lamby in the trash?   Lamby smells like pee.  And Harrison hasn't slept with Lamby in more than a year.  Used to be he couldn't go to sleep without it.  I remember.  Keep? No.  Yeah, a lot of kids sleep with security blankets when they're little but once they start socializing you know, learning how to be part of a group they don't need it.  And Harrison, because he's a genius, hit this milestone early.  He was so small.  Lamby was a gift from Rita's mother when he was born.  Maybe we should keep it for Harrison.  For Harrison, of course.  Some toys are more difficult than others to part with.  Speltzer is already back at work, digging graves.  He should start by digging his own.  Miami Metro impounded Speltzer's little pied \u00c3\u00a9 RV when he was arrested but they had to give it back once he was set free.  Ray's been juicing.  At least he doesn't mind needles.  I can hide up here, wait for Speltzer to come home.  I'll use the RV as my kill room and transportation to get rid of Ray's body.  And his trophies.  I'm still alive, but I don't think I'm going to like the reason why.  Speltzer couldn't have done all of this in a day.  Is this place his masterpiece? I don't run.  I make people run.  However, I do run if there's a bull coming after me with an axe.  You should really try taking a shower once in a while.  Where are you? Speltzer keeps forcing me down to the next floor.  So if he wants me to go down, what happens if I go up? He knows my face now.  If I want a rematch, I'm gonna have to be smarter.  To take Speltzer down, I have to make sure I have nothing to lose.  Harrison's only going to Orlando for a few weeks, Dexter.    Yep, I know.    He's gonna be fine.  All he'll wanna do is follow Cody around.  Thanks for driving him up.  I actually might spend a few days there, see what trouble I can get into.    Knock yourself out.    Thanks.  I'll take these down to the car.  Astor and Cody are excited to see you.  I want you to be good for your grandma and grandpa, okay? I'm not sending Harrison to Orlando because Deb asked me to but because Speltzer is a problem I need to solve.  Once I do, Harrison will come home where he belongs.    You mean more to me than     Pizza! That's right.  Pizza.  Let's go.  I will avenge your death.  Everything I do is for you.    Deb, you okay?   Yeah, yeah.  I wanna get back to the station finish up the paperwork on Mike's shooter.  Be there in a minute.  Motherfucker.  You impotent fuck.    You got some mouth.    What are you doing?   Haven't you done enough?   Oh, I'm just getting started.  You fucking motherfucking cocksucker!   All right     You fucking piece of shit!   Deb, get your shit together.    You're so easy, just like the others.  Get the fuck out of here.  Come on.  Fuck you up.  I'll you see around.  Batista called.    I'm sure he did.    What happened? I fucking lost my mind.  I saw Speltzer at Melanie's funeral.    Fucking smiling at the hearse, and     What'd you do? I fucking attacked him! I wanted to fucking kill him.  Fuck you.  Is that why you came here? To prove some fucking point that everybody wants someone dead? I came here to see how you are.  That's all.  I'm just fucking great.  Is this ever gonna get easier? Nothing's really all that different, Deb.  The only thing that's changed is now you know more about me.  What I know about you makes you a completely different person.  But I'm not.  I'm the same person I've always been.  Your brother, the same person who will always be there for you.  Maybe the question is whether you'll be there for me.  I don't know if I can feel the same way about us.  I do.  I do.  And I don't too.  Are we sure this Alex Dubrozny guy shot Mike Anderson?   Why are you trying to rattle this?   It smells like a set up.  And what does a set up smell like? This bartender had no record back in Kursk.  Suddenly he decides to murder three people? Alex had a short fuse, a broken heart and a loaded gun.  A gun that Masuka confirmed was the same one used on Mike.  And we got a sweet little suicide note that helped us solve not just Mike's murder, but two others.  That's what a set up smells like.  It's all too neat, too easy.  Alex wasn't even on our radar.    Why would he off himself now?   His conscience got to him.  Let's just swing by the club one last time, ask around.  This is Mike we're talking about here.  Fine.  Not tonight.    What's her name?   Nadia.    The stripper?   She's a dancer.    Doesn't keep a lot of clothes on.    You serious about her? I don't know what I am about her but she was real close to Kaja and Tony and all this is real hard on her.  I'm so glad you're there to comfort her.    Come on.    I'm just jealous.  At least you got someone in your life.  She's got a lot of pretty friends.  I'm a twice divorced detective staring down the barrel of retirement.  I'm already a clich\u00c3\u00a9.  Don't need to add a stripper to that list.  Fine.  We'll go by tomorrow.  Make sure Alex isn't some patsy for the mob.  Have a good night.  Fight or flight.  That's a part of everyone's lizard brain.  Speltzer may have a lizard brain like me but his shortcoming is he doesn't have much of a human brain.  What the fuck is this? The end of your run.  Get me out of here! Yell all you want.  No one's gonna hear you.  Fuck.  Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Feels good.  Fuck! Now is when I'd slice your cheek with my scalpel and get a drop of blood to remember you by but I can't risk anyone finding a blood slide ever again.  You're a fucking freak.  Everything's different now.  The memory of killing you will have to be enough.  I'm gonna kill you.  That would be a twist.  But not one that's gonna happen tonight.  You were supposed to be a way out of the tangle I was in with my sister a thread she could follow to understand me better to accept me even.  But she and I lost each other.  She almost lost herself going after you.  She wanted to catch you just as much as I did.  Who knows, maybe our relationship can rise from your ashes.  No.  No.  It's time for everyone to move on.  Goodbye, friends.  You came.  I wasn't sure you would.  Me neither.  What am I doing here? That smoke.  It's Speltzer.  Did you do this for me? No.  How do you feel? Glad.  What does that make me? Human.      Previous EpisodeNext Episode"

        "script": "Previously on Dexter Who is Dexter Morgan? He's just a jerk who works for Miami Metro Homicide.    That's Dexter Morgan.    His face it looks familiar.  Only one person who worked at Miami Metro took blood slides Sergeant Doakes, the Bay Harbor Butcher.  Same type of weapon used on Mike Anderson.  Are we sure this Alex Dubrozny guy shot Mike Anderson? Because it smells like a setup.  Hannah McKay, she spent six years in juvie after pleading guilty to being Randall's accomplice.  She always claimed she was just another one of his victims.  That what you're doing, to help us find the other bodies? My lawyer said it was for the best.  Do you understand your rights? He didn't say, \"Yes. \" He walked.    There is nothing we can do.    Fuck that.  Fuck all of this.  But there is something I can do.  That smoke.  It's Speltzer.  How do you feel? Glad.  What does that make me? It never ends, does it? The maintenance.  I don't mind it.  It's the one thing that never changes.  The waves keep rolling in wearing everything down in their path a little more every day.  Harrison's coming home.  I wanna have the boat ready.    So life's back to normal?   A new normal.  Deb's not poring over the past anymore.  We're on course, moving forward.  Life can be less complicated now.  You don't believe that.    Why not? She didn't abandon me.    She didn't accept you either.    She doesn't know what to think.    She's adjusting.  I did everything in my power to protect her from you, what you really are.    A monster?   Your words.  Your thoughts.  You didn't think she could handle it because you couldn't.  Deb is stronger.  For now.  But the long term exposure it's going to eat away at her, like salt water on steel.  Blood.  It's not from Viktor.  I never leave a mess behind.  Who's been on my boat? This is too much blood.  Someone died here.  Someone I didn't kill.  Who are you? If I'm getting shit canned and you know something about it just give me a heads up, all right? We're bros.  First of all, we are not and never will be bros.  Secondly, I've told you a million times, I don't know anything.  Really? Then why did your voice just rise? Look, I took a class in paralinguistics.  Change in pitch, dead giveaway for lying.  Get away from my desk.    Am I getting the axe?   You are if you don't get out of my way.  I got off the phone and LaGuerta's processing evidence at a private lab.  What are you talking about? A charred blood slide containing the blood of one Travis Marshall.  I asked myself, \"Vince, if your boss is processing evidence   at another lab   \"   Blood slide? Are you certain? Increase in vocal volume, indicating emotional dissonance.  You know something.  I'm fucked.  I am sure that LaGuerta is using an outside lab because she knows how slammed you are.    I'll look into this, so just fucking relax.    Okay.  Thanks, LT.  You rock.    Got a second?   Sure.  Masuka got wind that you're using an outside lab to run evidence and he thinks he's gonna get fired.  ls there anything I should know? I needed a second pair of eyes on something.  It's nothing.  Does this have anything to do with the Bay Harbor Butcher? Lundy carried that notebook everywhere he went.  Get the door.  This has to remain between you and me.  Of course.  I had a lab analyse a blood slide that I found at the abandoned church.  A blood slide, like a Bay Harbor Butcher trophy? Travis Marshall's blood was on it.  Doakes was the Bay Harbor Butcher and Doakes is dead.  Well, what if it wasn't Doakes? What if the Bay Harbor Butcher is still alive and at work? What if he killed Travis Marshall? Except Travis Marshall wasn't cut up into pieces and put into bags.  But the fact that the Bay Harbor Butcher kept blood slides was never released to the public.  It's probably not some copycat.  How do you explain this? I can't.  I know it sounds impossible but I never believed that Doakes was a killer.  And from his notes, Lundy had his doubts too.  Well, you can add me to that list.  Doakes was my partner.  He was a good man.  Is there anything I can do to help? You have no idea how good it is to hear you say that.  I've been keeping this all to myself.  Your eyes only.  My eyes only.  Fuck.  Fuck.  Motherfucking suck bag.  You cock munching, fucking fuck nugget.  Fuck.  The blood on my boat belongs to Louis Greene? Louis is dead? Why was he killed on my boat? Why would he have even been on my boat? Why   Is my sister looking at me like that?   Dex.  We are in a storm of fuck.  LaGuerta found a slide with Travis Marshall's blood on it at the fucking church.    That's not good.    How the fuck do you lose a slide? Deb, you know that night wasn't my usual scenario.  Are you saying it's my fault LaGuerta thinks the Bay Harbor Butcher is alive? No, that's not what I meant but that night at the church wasn't exactly by the playbook.  I talked LaGuerta into letting me help with the investigation so I can keep tabs on what's happening.  You what? No.  I'll deal with this.  I don't want you involved.  Well, it's a little fucking late for that.  She wants to talk to the friends and family of everyone on this list who's gone missing since Doakes died.  They all the fit the victim profile of the Bay Harbor Butcher.  Anyone here that you recognise? These three are mine.  This is never gonna end, is it? They were bad people, Deb who would've continued to do bad things.  This is the only one with family in Miami: Phillip Barnes.  So when LaGuerta and I split up the list I'll make sure I get his family.    No, I don't like you doing this.    I don't give a fuck what you like, Dexter.  It's beyond that.  This is my ass too.  Tell me what I need to know about Barnes.  He was a wedding photographer.  He would find a guest from out of town.  Young, female, by herself.  He would charm her, invite her back to his hotel.  She'd never come home.  He took pictures of what he did.  So, what did you do? He was going out of town for another job so I nabbed him after a reception.  A reception? A fucking wedding reception? Dexter, what if Barnes got a picture of you?   Deb, it was a wedding.    What if someone remembers you? Everyone was concentrating on the bride and groom.  I slipped in and out.  It's fine.    What if you're wrong?   I'm not.  LaGuerta will not tie me to this.  There's no body, no proof.  Stay away from it, okay? First thing I have to do is find out why Louis was killed on my boat.  My curtains are open.  With Harrison gone, Jamie is not around.  Someone has been in my apartment.  Maybe still is.  Hey, Dex.  It's Sam.  Just wanna confirm we're still on for 1:00 at Schooner or Later at 12th and Bayshore Drive.  See you there.  I've met him before at the bar at The Fox Hole owned by the Koshka Brotherhood.  The man who killed Mike Anderson, Viktor Baskov was one of the Koshkas.  Could they have figured out I killed Viktor and sent a hit man after me?   Excuse me.    Yes.  I think I have a phone call for you.  A small coffee, please.    Hello?   Why were you in my apartment? Well, aren't you Mr.  Smarty Pants? Answer the question.  What were you doing in my place? I was looking to have a discussion about a friend who's gone missing.  Viktor.  I'm sure you remember him.  I have no idea who you're talking about.    I don't care for lies.    I told you, I don't know who that is.  You're wasting both our time.  Louis Greene, who I found on your boat the boat that was used to dump Viktor in the ocean   gave me your name.    So you killed Louis.  We had a conversation that ended rather abruptly, yes.  What else did Louis say? I believe he may have referred to you as a douche bag.    You think you're very clever.    I do, actually, yes.  Your bosses at the Koshka Brotherhood they sent you? You've done your homework.  There are no bosses telling me what to do.  Viktor was a friend of mine.  This is personal.  So an eye for an eye, huh? Your friend Viktor kills an innocent woman and a cop and killing me somehow settles the score? Oh, you misunderstand me.  I'm not stopping with you.  I also want any of your police officer friends involved in this little vendetta.    Wait.    Including your lieutenant sister.  I've done my homework too.  It was just me.  She had nothing to do with this.  Hello, handsome.  I work alone.  I killed Viktor, only me.  I'll see you around.  That's the plan.  Why in fuckville are you telling me to meet you in the parking garage? Because of him.    Do you wanna be more specific?   His name is Isaak Sirko.  He's part of the Koshka Brotherhood.  He's after me.  But don't worry.  I'm gonna take care of it.    What did you do?   But you could be in danger too.  That's why you need to know.  That's why we're meeting     Dex.    But I'm gonna handle this.  Why is he after you? Viktor Baskov.  Viktor Baskov disappeared.    You killed him.    He killed Mike Anderson.  What about the guy that said he killed Mike? The bartender that blew his brains out? Someone put him up to it, Isaak probably.  So that you would close the case and move on.  This is un fucking real.  Viktor Baskov was on his way back to Kiev.  I had to kill him.  I didn't have any time.  There wasn't   Time? You didn't have time to make a phone call so that I could arrest him or something?   His flight was leaving.    His fl   How do you know he killed Mike? I found his fingerprint at the scene.  And you didn't tell me? You kept it from the Police Department? Dexter, what happened to you only taking care of people that slip through the cracks of the justice system? You can't rip a case open   so that it falls into your fucking lap.    I know.  Obviously you don't know, Dexter, because this is normal for you.  But trust me, this is not fucking normal for me, not at all.  How am I supposed to do my job? Which is the be all, end all of hypocrisy because I am the lieutenant of Homicide and I have already helped you cover up two murders.  Three.  This makes three.  And the fucking bartender.  Oh, my fucking God.  Oh, my God.  How did this become my life?   Deb, where are you going?   I'm gonna arrest Isaak.    Take him to jail.    On what charge?   I'll find something!   No.  We can't   I can't afford to risk him talking.  Look, I will handle this, but until I do, we need to take extra precautions.  Isaak is convinced that there's some police conspiracy.  He thinks we all killed Viktor, so you're at risk too.    What?   But I can keep you safe.  We're gonna go to a hotel.  A place where no one knows who we are no one asks any questions, a place where we'll both be safe.  This is fucking fantastic.  He might be watching the precinct, your home.  I need you to take a car from the motor pool make sure you never leave the same way twice.  Make sure no one follows you.  I'll do the same.    I need you to promise me something.    What? That you will never take a case from the Police Department again   from me, ever.    Okay.  Are you lying to me?   I don't think so.    You don't think so?   You don't fucking think so?   I'm not lying.  I have no way of knowing, do I? When you begin a stalk, you start with what you know.  And with Isaak, that isn't much.  Isaak isn't just some hit man.  He's a boss.    Yes?   Dexter, Hannah McKay is on her way in.  I'm kind of tied up with something right now.  Dexter, Hannah is gonna talk us through her road trip with Wayne Randall and help us find the rest of the bodies.  This is important.  Get here now.  Right.  I'm on my way.  In that first week Wayne shot a gas station attendant in Ashford, Alabama.  That's where these are from.  And Wayne shot another attendant in Lake City, Florida.  And then he shot a guy outside of Sarasota who stopped to help you fix a flat.  You then get picked up in Miami trying to sneak on board a cruise ship.  That week you guys were in Miami that's the story we don't know.  The people Wayne killed, the bodies we'd like to find.  It looks like it starts here.  We got to Miami and we were the only thing on the news.  We were desperate.  No money, cops everywhere.  Wayne decided that we would hide out in the motels until we could make it to that cruise ship.  He killed people so we could take their rooms.  We buried the bodies close to the motels.    Where were the motels?   One was by a Frosty Swirl.    Wayne's favourite.    That's where Ms.  Dubois was found.    What about these?   Those two go together.    Together?   They were a couple.  Husband and wife, I guess.    Where are they buried?   Close to one of the ports.    I remember big ships unloading.    And the motel? Small, one storey, I think I would recognise it, but so much of that time is just a blur, you know? Everything changed in Miami.  Wayne, most of all.  I was so scared.  I thought that he was gonna kill me.  He forced me to dig those holes and every time that I dug one of them I wasn't sure if I was digging my own grave or not.  I understand how difficult this is for you, but if you'll excuse me I'm gonna get the ball rolling on the next dig.  Tomorrow if possible.  Sure.  I'd like to get this over with.  That toy isn't bringing back memories of being scared.  She's nostalgic.  No touching.  Can I have your giraffe back, please? It's Wayne's.  Wayne's giraffe.  It was wrapped in your shirt.  What, are you a detective now too? Sergeant Batista will give you the details for tomorrow.  Will you be there? I hope so.  Killing Isaak would make a lot of Koshkas very angry.  But a lot of Colombians very happy.  The goddamn shower has two settings, scalding and freezing.  It's a cheap motel.  That's the point.  I'm not doing this another night.  Hopefully you won't have to.  Does that mean you're working on a solution? I have a plan, yes.  Does it involve you killing someone? I'm not killing anybody.  That's my bed.  Closest to the door.    Tell me your plan.    No.  Dexter, I'm hiding out in this fucking motel room.  I'm a part of this.  But not any more than you need to be.  This is not how I ever imagined spending tonight.  We've stayed in hotel rooms before.  Yeah, when we went to Myrtle Beach to visit Mom's sister.  There were seashells embedded in the plaster in the walls.  No air conditioning, just ceiling fans.  There was sand from the beach everywhere.  Even in the beds.  You kept your eyes on me all day.  I didn't want you to drown.  You were my hero.  Good boy.  Good.  Hot as hell out here even with the ocean breeze.  Think we'll find anything? The motel Hannah and Wayne stayed at is still here.  Nothing's changed much since their spree.  Pretty good odds.  Can I ask you something? This bartender who shot himself, Alex Dubrozny.  Do you think it's a suicide? Masuka matched his handwriting to the note he left.  His fingerprints were on the gun, GSR on the hand.  He definitely pulled the trigger.  Fucking bugs.  I'm gonna go get some spray from the car.  This part of the job? Stand around and stare? I'm not needed unless there's a body or blood.  I don't know how you do it.  First time Wayne killed somebody, he shot him right in the chest and I I couldn't move.  Never seen that much blood in my life.  First crime scene I ever worked a woman stabbed her husband after fixing him a sandwich.  By the time I got there, he looked like he was asleep just floating on a sea of red and the sandwich next to his head.  Seemed so sad that no one was gonna eat it.  Look at us talking blood and gore like we're on a date sharing our first sexual experience.  I've got work to do.  There you are.  Aren't you supposed to be talking to the Connors? They were less than cooperative.  This was on my way back to the station, so I thought I'd sit in.  Great.  Hi.  I'm Captain Maria LaGuerta, Miami Metro and this is Lieutenant Debra Morgan.  I talked to your morn, Patricia.  Is she home? No, sorry.  She got called into work.    Oh, we'll come back.    Is this about my dad? She said you guys had called.  I could try to answer any questions, if you want.    That would be very helpful.    Yeah.    Thanks.    Yeah.  When was the last time you saw your father? May 19th, 2007.  The best fucking day of my life.  How so? Because he never came back.  So wasn't it hard growing up without a father? It was a lot better than growing up with a father who beat me and my mom every chance he got.  I'm sorry.  Then one night, he didn't come home.  I swear everything got better.  My morn wasn't crying all the time and I wasn't constantly looking over my shoulder.  Ty, you mentioned the last time you saw your father he was working a wedding? Yeah, my mom printed out some pictures for you from that night.    She thought you might want them.    Great.  What are you hoping to find in these pictures? Special Agent Lundy had this theory that the Bay Harbor Butcher was in law enforcement.  If Barnes was killed by the Butcher   His face might be in one of the pictures.  We might even know him.  Or her.    Would you mind?   Yeah, no.  Okay.  What are you looking for exactly? We think your father may have been abducted and murdered the night he disappeared and the person responsible could be in these pictures.  Mom would finally know he's not coming home.  This is a big wedding.  A lot of pictures.  You know, maybe I should take these back to the station and spend the day going over them.  You're right.  We shouldn't rush this.  Thank you, Ty.  Thanks.  Right here.  Put it down.  Go ahead, detective.  \"Till death do us part\" didn't quite work out for these guys.  Get it? Because they're dead but they're still together.  Okay, moving on.  Shower curtain helped preserve the bodies and the clothes.  Our lucky day.  It's a safe assumption that Wayne started with the male.  Would've been important to immobilise him first because he presented the biggest threat.  There are defensive wounds on the arms and the hands.  He put up a fight.  Judging from the cuts in the fabric we're looking at perhaps a 6 inch knife.  Numerous shallow wounds until Wayne was able to inflict this, the fatal wound.  Once he was done with him he moved on to the female victim.  Stabbed numerous times.  The spatter pattern suggests the victim fell on her back.  And these voids here likely indicate that she was straddled by her assailant.  Who was much smaller than Wayne.  If Wayne didn't kill this person Dexter.  What does it mean? I'm not sure.  It could mean a lot of things.  I won't know until I get back to the lab and run some tests.  I guess we're done here.    Why did you stop?   Stop what? You started to describe how Wayne killed that girl and you got halfway through and then you stopped.  Yeah, I did.    And then you looked right at me.    I did.  Why? The spatter told me a story that conflicts what you say happened.  Really? How so? How did you get this? It's a little something I got for talking back to Wayne.    He got angry and slashed at me.    Bullshit.    Do you know something that I don't?   Wayne didn't kill that woman.  He was too busy with the male.  It was someone smaller.  Someone with a different knife who was inexperienced.  Got carried away with the frenzy of the moment.  Stabbed the woman over and over until the knife got so bloody her hand slipped along the edge of the sharp blade cutting her palm very deeply, exactly like yours leaving a passive spatter stain on the victim's dress.  Everything you said is a lie.  That's my story.  And I'm sticking to it.  And you don't even care.  You have immunity, don't you? The DA gave you immunity for cooperating with us.  From any crime committed with Wayne, yeah.  Yeah.  A girl's gotta protect herself.  I'll see you around, Dexter Morgan.  Isaak.  I knew you would show up eventually.  Don't worry.  I'm not gonna lose you.  Welcome to the wrong side of town, Isaak.  Not used to strangers here.  Koshkas.  And certainly not used to their sworn enemies walking in.  But Isaak, being from out of town, won't know any of this.  Definitely not as much fun as putting Isaak on my table.  But it does mask his death as the resulting war between rival heroin dealers.  Who's saving whose ass now?   What's up?   I know you're busy.  I also want you to know that I'm not trying to stir up any shit.  Of course not.  It's about this Alex Dubrozny suicide.  There's something about this guy being Anderson's killer that's just not right.  Sorry.  It's Dispatch.  Sergeant Batista.  Okay.  Got it.  Gonna have to rain check this.  Homicide at a Colombian hangout.  Got blood, Dexter.    Where we going?   Mateo's Bar.    Know it?   Nope.  I'll meet you there.  Holy shit.  It's like somebody turned on the hose and sprayed blood everywhere.  Great.  I left Isaak here outnumbered and expected to find only his body.  So where is he now? Do we know these guys? This is Andres Rodriguez.  He's a member of the Rojas Cartel.  We ran into each other a few times when I worked Narcotics.  Is it possible Isaak did all of this? Why do drug hits have to be so messy? You gotta make a big show.  Who you think is good for this? The 87's?   Or the Koshka Brotherhood.    Koshkas? What happened here, Dex? Considering this one was closest to the door he's probably first to see the attacker, first to respond.  He drew his gun as the attacker fired.  The misting on the jukebox and the wall indicates multiple bullet hits all through and through.    Victim number two.    Looks like he got a shot off.  But, that didn't stop the assault.  The attacker returned fire.  Twice in the chest, once in the stomach.  Judging from the lack of pooling around the body suggests that the victim was dead before the third shot.  Wait.  How many people were here shooting? There's only evidence of one killer.    One brutally efficient killer.    Jesus, fuck.  Looks like our attacker ran out of bullets right around here.  It's from a defensive wound.  Looks like it was a deep cut, forearm maybe.  Obviously not fatal.  The attacker grabbed the nearest weapon, hit his victim over the head inflicted a massive skull fracture and walked right out the door.  So, we're looking for the fucking Terminator.  Let's get the blood running through the system.  Maybe we can match it to a name.  Everybody outside.  Let's let Dexter and Masuka do their thing.  Sarge, you mind if I run an errand real quick? Was this part of your fantastic plan? I never said my plan was fantastic but no, this is not how I thought it would go.  Do we have an even bigger problem on our hands now? Not if we can find a match for this blood.  You'll be able to make an arrest.  The sooner the better.  I couldn't agree more.  Right here, baby.  Your car is fixed.  You have to start using it.  But I like having a chauffeur.  Come on.  Let me show you how much I like it.  I wish I could, but I have work to do.  Oh, just forget about work.  We're gonna have to fucking pay them back.  I'll get some guys, do it myself if you want.    No.    Well, they're sure as shit gonna come after us.  And we can't sit around and do nothing.  Shit.  We don't need a cop here now.    Who is he?   Joey Quinn.  He came up from Narcotics, and now he's Homicide.  We used to have an understanding with him.  What kind of understanding? Leave a bag of cash in his car, and he'd do whatever we asked.  Mostly just look the other way.  Fuck.  Well? Lieutenant, are the cuffs necessary? Probably not.  Would your client like to have a little chat with us? My client has nothing to say.  He's exercising his American right to silence.  Well, fucking God bless America.  Get this guy to Booking.  Your client's going to jail for the rest of his life.  Nice to meet you, Lieutenant Morgan.  Maybe now that lsaak's behind bars, we can have that face to face he's been so desperate for.  So you got Isaak Sirko.  We got Isaak Sirko.  Congratulations.  It's a big deal.  May I?   Our earlier conversation.    Right.  I don't think Alex Dubrozny shot Mike Anderson.  It doesn't make any sense.  Alex has been in this country for two years and according to every stripper I interviewed all he talked about was his wife and his kids.  He didn't show any interest towards Kaja.  I think someone put Alex up to this.  Someone connected to Isaak Sirko.  Deb, I still think Viktor Baskov killed Mike Anderson and Viktor just disappeared into thin air.    But if we can find     Sergeant.    Your dedication is admirable.    Deb, you don't have to talk like that.    It's     And a year ago I might have been right beside you, fighting for what I thought was right.  But the hardest lesson that I've learned as lieutenant is knowing when to back the fuck down.  You don't believe me? You don't have concrete evidence to support your theory.  And I can't afford to reopen a murder investigation.  This isn't any murder investigation.  This is Mike.    He     Mike's killer's dead.  Mike got justice.  Let it go.  That's an order.  Okay, lieutenant.  You got it.    Hello, Isaak.    Hello, Dexter.  I underestimated you.  You come here to taunt me? I thought maybe you could help me.  Why is it so important that you kill me? Well, it's quite simple, really.  You killed Viktor.  I liked Viktor.  Like or not, he killed Mike Anderson.  Is that why you killed him? Revenge? Yes.  There was the briefest flicker of hesitation there.  But if you're telling the truth then you don't require any explanation.  You understand the need for vengeance.  So you got arrested.  There'll be a trial.  You'll go to prison for a long time.  Does that mean this is over?   Over?   Yes.  I had a great uncle my grandfather's brother.  He was a hero.  Fought with the Red Army during the Second World War.  When he returned to Kiev afterwards, some fat, little party official resented the fact that everyone admired him so he decided to make an example of him by taking away his house.  When my great uncle protested he was hung in front of the council chambers.  My grandfather was just a teenager.  When that party official saw the hatred in his eyes he had him arrested and sent to Siberia.  And the years rolled by.  And my grandfather got on with his life as best he could.  He was a patient man.  Finally, when the Soviet Union fell, he returned to Kiev and celebrated in front of city hall with all the others.  And that's when he found that fat, little party official and he got to enjoy the pleasure that belonged to him and him alone by sticking a 6 inch knife into that fat, little man's kidney.  So you ask me if this is over.  No.  I'm afraid not.    There's only one problem.    And that is? I'm not some fat, little man.  That's true.  I don't know who you are.  If you ever find out, you'll regret it.  Hey.  Come on in.  See this? What is it? It's me lifeguarding your ass for a change.  I took it from LaGuerta.    I told you to stay clear of this.    Well, you're lucky I didn't.    Deb     She would've seen you, Dexter.  So you saved me.  Yeah.  Thanks.  That's yours.  It's not mine.  I don't wanna be involved in that part of your life.  I don't want you to be.  I know you're not gonna stop.  But I don't wanna know about it.  Okay.  I had to lie to Batista.  Batista.  For you.  And that was the moment I realised that I don't wanna be a part of this.  I can't do it.  It took me forever to wrap my brain around the idea that you're not who I thought you were.  But it doesn't mean I have to change.  All of your stealing and your lying and your covering up that's not me.  So you think LaGuerta's investigation is closed? No.  Lundy didn't figure me out.  No reason to think LaGuerta will.  Oh, if Lundy could see me now.  And you.  I've been thinking about our vacation to Myrtle Beach a lot.  How we spent our days.  On the beach.  Running up and down the shore.  And at low tide, running in and out of the water.  I was always chasing you.  I could never catch you.  You wouldn't take off your flippers.  Even if I did, you were always just out of reach.  Maybe, we're learning it's better that way.  Did you get the blood report back on the bodies from the dig? Yeah.  And? Anything I should know? Nope.  As kids, Deb and I would try to outrun the waves but I would always end up diving under them.  I would swim deep because I could withstand the pull of the tide.  But Deb was always safest at shore.  From here on out, I'll face the depths by myself.      Previous EpisodeNext Episode"

        "script": "Previously on Dexter LaGuerta found a blood slide with Travis Marshall's blood on it at the fucking church.  Talked her into letting me help with the Bay Harbour Butcher investigation so I can keep tabs on what's happening.  You what? That toy isn't bringing back memories of being scared.  She was straddled by her assailant.  Wayne didn't kill that woman.  Well, it was someone smaller.  Stabbed the woman until the knife got so bloody her hand slipped along the edge of the sharp blade cutting her palm very deeply.  Everything you've said is a lie.  That's my story and I'm sticking to it.  Did you get the blood report back? From the bodies from the dig? Yeah.  Anything I should know? Nope.  Just forget about work.  Joey Quinn.  Used to have an understanding with him.  Leave a bag of cash in his car and he'd do whatever we asked.  He drew his gun as the attacker fired.  This blood is from a defensive wound.  So you got arrested, there'll be a trial, you'll go to prison for a long time.  Does that mean this is over? No.  Hannah McKay.  She stabbed a woman five times.  And since I found out, all I can think about is giving her what she deserves.  Maybe she deserves a little slack.  When she killed that woman, she was only 15.  Scared of Wayne.  On the run.  It could have been a one time thing.  I saw the way she touched her trophies.  Nostalgic.  And when you like to kill, you don't just stop.  She must have killed again since Wayne.  You have no evidence to support that.  Her husband died of a heart attack at 40.  Perfect health, no family history.    Seems suspicious.    You're really reaching here, Dexter.  I know she killed her husband.  I can feel it.  I just need proof.  Don't you have more pressing concerns? Debra, LaGuerta, Isaak.  Why do you think I need a kill so badly?   Where do you think you're going?   To talk to her.  Get her to slip up about her husband.  Give me a lead.  What makes you think she'll tell you anything? Last time you saw her, you accused her of murder.  Good point.  I need a peace offering.  And this is a big opportunity for the department.  Arresting the head of the Koshka Brotherhood is good.  Sorry I'm late.  I can't even be late without making Deb angry.  You all did great work.  The arraignment went well.  Sirko was denied bail.  He has a small army of lawyers, and they're putting his bail up for review.  No way he'll get out.    Not on three counts of murder.    Hope you're right.  So do I.  As long as Isaak's behind bars, I'll have time to deal with Hannah.  Of course he's right.  The guy killed three Colombians.  Plus, we have evidence that puts Sirko at the scene.  None of that will matter   if his team claims self defence.    It's a solid case.  We still need to make sure the captain is prepared for any questions the DA may ask.  Look, we have all seen cases that we thought were a sure thing go south.  The right lawyers, the right jury, anything can happen.  Which is why the DA wants to make sure it doesn't.  At least I can make a peace offering to one woman in my life.  If I want Hannah to give me the time of day I need to show her I'm not a threat.  And how do you intend to do that? I haven't filled out the blood report for those bodies we dug up.  I could fudge it.  Omit some key facts.  Forget to run the blood on the victim's dress for Hannah's DNA.  The cops think Wayne Randall killed those people.  If I don't tell them otherwise, they won't know different.  Didn't you promise your sister you wouldn't take cases from the police? Hannah has immunity.  Nothing the cops can do.  Telling Deb will only make her crazy.  Then what? You think you'll just show Hannah this report and she'll confess? Tell you she killed her husband? What other choice do I have? You're blocking my view.  It's a wall.  To you, perhaps.  To me, it's a blank canvas.  A projection screen for the mind.  You killed three of our boys, smartass.  You're not gonna sound so smart when you're bleeding like a stuck pig.  Right.  You and your Colombian friends haven't really thought this through.  Now, as a businessman, I've found you have to weigh short term gains against long term consequences.  True, you and your men could retaliate.  In the short term, I'd be dead.  But I'm not the only member of the Koshkas.  I could have 100 men here should anything happen to me, understand? Yeah.  We outnumber you.  We out gun you.  Quite frankly, we're smarter than you.  So I'm afraid in the long term your plan falls a little short.  Now, the art of any deal is negotiation.  Have we come to terms? Yeah.  Hi, you've reached George Novikov.  Leave me a message.  George, it's Isaak.  I need you to pay me a visit.  It's urgent.  Hannah should be on her way back from the flower mart right about now.  I'll be able to catch her before I go to work.  I've watched her for days.  She never changes her schedule.  Hannah.  Great, you're a stalker.    What happened to Peter Cottontail?   Poison.  Rabbits kill my plants, so I kill them.  You could just trap them and let them go.  When you do that, they come back.  I do what I have to do.  Remind me to never show up on your property uninvited.  Too late.  So you've accused me of murder, animal cruelty.    Anything else?   Actually, I came to apologise.  It's a copy of the blood report from the bodies you helped us find.  Wayne Randall's victims.  Wayne's victims, huh? The blood evidence was inconclusive.  I realised it when I got back to my lab.  I shouldn't have accused you.  I'm really sorry.  Thanks.  It takes a real gentleman to admit when he's wrong.    What?   You have a little Dirt.  Occupational hazard.  I can get pretty dirty.  Right.  Remember why you're here.  Dead husband.  Since I'm here, I could use a plant for my apartment.  Really? A plant? Follow me.    Any idea what you're looking for?   Just a plant.  Something planty.  You're the expert.  Well, why don't you tell me about your place? So I can get a better idea.  It's a one bedroom on the water, lots of sunlight.    You live alone?   Currently, yeah.    You?   Currently, yeah.    And before?   I was married for a little while.  Unfortunately, he passed away.  How about this one? If you take good care of it, it'll last for years.  Really? I always figured once you took flowers home they had already started to die.    That's kind of a morbid outlook.    Is it? Yeah, I guess I'm kind of maybe a morbid guy.  So how'd he die, your husband? Heart attack, but we really don't need to talk about it.  We can though if you want to.  I mean, I understand.  My wife died too.  Oh, what happened? She was murdered.  Oh, God, that's That's awful.  Yeah.  Different from your situation, obviously.  Yeah.  All this doom and gloom.  You mind if we change the subject? I do, actually.  If her husband's off limits, I'll have to take another tack.    So how long have you had this place?   About a year.  Worked for the previous owner before that.  Beverly Grey, amazing woman.  I've kept the business exactly the same as when she ran it.  Same clients, same schedule.  I even kept her handyman on.    Where is she now? Retired?   She passed away about a year ago.  That's when I took over.  Dead husband, dead mentor.  It was actually a really sad time, so I'd I'd rather not talk about it.  Sorry, I wasn't going for more doom and gloom.  Seems you have a knack.    I should get going.  I gotta get to work.    But you still haven't picked a plant.  That one.  Pink.  Really? What do I owe you? Consider it a gift.  Thanks.  See you around.  Since Hannah stabbed her first victim, two people close to her have died.  Seems I'm not the only one with a knack for doom and gloom.  Beverly Grey.  The deceased mentor of Hannah McKay.  I paid a visit to the clerk of county.  Beverly's will listed Hannah as her lone beneficiary.  Makes sense.  No children, no immediate family.  Why wouldn't Beverly leave Hannah her legacy? But if Hannah were Beverly's heir apparent it'd give her motive for murder.  The question is, is Hannah responsible for her death?   Cause of death, heart attack.    Just like her husband.    Seems suspicious.    Or not.  Heart disease is the leading cause of death in this country.  Hell, it got me.  What about poison? That's the way women usually kill.    Safe.  Detached.    She poisons rabbits, Dexter.  It doesn't mean she poisons people.  Why are you so convinced she's still a killer? I know that face.  Sal Price.  Maybe he can tell me something about Hannah I don't already know.  Hey, was that Sal Price?   Yeah.  What do you care?   I read his book.  I'm a fan.  Since when do you read true crime? Since we started working on the Wayne Randall case.  I'm learning new things about you.  What was Price doing here? He heard we dug up more Wayne Randall victims.  He wants to reissue his book.  He asked if he could see the case files.    I said I'd have copies made.    Shit.  The case is closed.  What's the big deal? I fudged the blood report for starters.  No, it's just Was he leaving? I wanna ask him to sign my book.  Went to the coffee truck while I'm having copies made.  I'm sure he'd love to.    Coffee.    Mr.  Price? Hi.  Dexter Morgan.  I'm a big fan.  I was hoping maybe I can get an autograph? Yeah, sure.  Of course.  Morgan.    Any relation to the lieutenant?   Yeah, she's my sister.  She says you're writing an update on the new bodies.  That's exciting.  Is she single? Yeah, last time I checked.  Look, I should warn you, since we're talking about a solved crime I didn't put much time into my blood report.  That's okay, I usually have my own guy take a look.  Just in case.  What are you hoping to find? I have a little theory that Hannah McKay deserves her own sequel.  So does your sister date, or   ? You're writing a book about Hannah McKay? What are the highlights? Come on, give me something.  Just a teaser for a fan.  Only if you put in a good word for me with your sister.  Sure.  So? Hannah McKay? Right, so get this.  Right out of juvie, Hannah moves into a halfway house.  Seems like all's well until she accuses some counsellor of abusing her sexually.    So, what happened?   Nothing.  Guy gets a slap on the wrist.  But a couple of weeks later, he drops dead.  Rat poisoning.  Sound like a coincidence to you? Wow, I don't know.  Three makes a pattern.  Maybe they all got in her way.  Well, that's all you're getting out of me.  You want the rest, read the book.  I'm gonna go check on those files.  Pleasure to meet you, Dexter Morgan.  I will read your book, Mr.  Price.  But I won't be waiting for it to come out in hard copy.  You are now officially my favourite lieutenant.  Can I buy you an adult beverage as a token of my appreciation? Some place dark and not too loud? That sounds like a date.  Not to me.  it sounds like a beautiful police lieutenant sharing an evening with a handsome crime writer.  Can I take a rain check?   Sorry.    Don't be.  I get it.  Me coming here, asking you out.  You think I'm trying to write your story.    Which, I'm not by the way.    My story? Being engaged to the Ice Truck Killer.    I'm sure you got     That hadn't occurred to me.    That what you're doing?   I wasn't.  How do I know that's not some tactic? Are you always this defensive? Sorry, I didn't mean to be defensive.  I'm just not really in a dating mode.  Dating mode.  That's a thing.  My life is really fucking complicated.  Fine, but for the record, I like complicated.  So if you happen to change your mind, give me a call.  Oh, sorry, had garlic for lunch.  You have gum in here, yes? What is that? George left it in my car the last time I was at the club.  Figured you knew about it.  Why would he do that? He used to give me cash to look the other way when I worked Narcotics.  I thought you were joking when you said you were a dirty cop.  I was joking.  I'm a good cop.    I also like money.    Joey.  I know.  I figured George was gonna ask me for something small but now that lsaak's been arrested I'm not sure I wanna do whatever it is they're gonna ask me to do.  You're sure you didn't know? If I did, I would have told you to give it back.    You're giving this back, right?   I'm thinking about it.  Joey, these are dangerous people.  You know, there's like 10 grand in that bag.  What good is money if you're dead? I'm not for sale.  Take care of yourself.  Price is going through my evidence at the police station.  Turnaround is fair play.  Hopefully his thoughts about Hannah are a little more organised.  Looks like Price and I share an obsession.  But he's had years to follow Hannah's every move.  I need to catch up.  Price's source material.  I'll have to come back to see what he has on me.  Right now, I have to get in and get out.  A blood test for Hannah's mentor Beverly Grey.  Whatever it means, I'll bet Price wrote about it.  Yeah, I'm good.  Fine, fine.    So have you heard from Louis?   No.  Thank God.  I mean, hookers? Gross.  Who does that? Yeah.  Gross.  So, what do you think of this place? I guess it's cute.  Kind of a dive.  Because the owner's thinking about selling and I'm thinking about buying.  How are you gonna find the time to run a restaurant with all the hours you put in? I could just retire.  I've put in my 20 years.    So you're just gonna quit?   Retire.    Do something else?   Yeah.  Look, Angel, you're my brother and I love you.  But this is a big decision.  And we both know you're impulsive.  You get these crazy ideas, like, you wanna buy a     I don't get     You do and then you end up divorced.  With a broken down Trans Am and barely enough money to pay the rent.  I see you brought Jurg.  So good to see you both getting on in my absence.  You kidding? Since you've been arrested can't take a shit without Lurch breathing down my neck.  Well, someone has to keep an eye on you while I'm in here.  So, what's the big emergency? You need to get me out of here as soon as humanly possible.    What happened?   Nothing.  Yet.  But I'd really like to avoid killing anyone in here.  It would get in the way of my being released.  Have you heard from Detective Quinn? He He gave back the money.  Which is weird, because he's never turned down a payoff before.  George.  Do not disappoint me.  Hi.  Quinn.  Reservation for two.  Your other party's already arrived.    Right this way, Mr.  Quinn.    Okay.  Enjoy your dinner.  What the fuck is this? Where's Nadia? If you hurt her, I will put a bullet through your motherfucking head.  Easy, detective.  Don't make a scene.  Nadia is a valuable commodity.  We wouldn't do that.  Not unless we had to.    What do you want from me?   I don't want shit.  But Isaak Sirko he wants you to lose the blood evidence linking him to the murders.    Why the fuck would I do that for you?   You took our money.  And I gave it back.  I don't owe you shit.  Not the way Isaak sees it.  Now, he did you a favour by taking out those Colombian scumbags.  As soon as you let him go, he'll head back to the Ukraine.  You'll never hear from him again.    It's not that big a deal.    Then find someone else.  Now, why would we do that when we have you? Joey, come on.  You know we got you.  What happens if I don't cooperate? I'm thinking of transferring Nadia to one of our sex clubs in Dubai.  But she's a strong girl.  She'll last a couple weeks before she slits her wrists.  If I do this Nadia's a free woman.  You give me her fucking passport, understand? Deal.  And I'll do you one better.  You can even keep the cash.  See, Joe? Just like old times.  It's Nadia.  Leave a message.  Nadia, it's Joey.  Call me as soon as you get this.    You wanted to see me?   Yeah.    How was the meeting with the DA?   Fine.  He's confident that we have enough evidence to put Sirko away.  Thank the sweet fucking baby Jesus.  That's not what I wanted to talk to you about.  I had my last two interviews yesterday.  With families of the missing persons who could have been victims of the Bay Harbor Butcher? And? Any leads? Not a one.  It's frustrating.  So I started looking into open cases.  I figure a lot of homicide suspects vanish into thin air.  What if the Butcher took some of them out? That's good thinking.    Did you find anything?   Maybe.  Remember the barrel girls? A swamp full of blonds in barrels, all of them raped, electrocuted and embalmed? Yeah, how could I forget it? All five suspects, including self help guru Jordan Chase went missing before we could build a case against them.  You're thinking the Butcher could have killed them.    There were two vigilante killers.    Maybe he took on an accomplice.  One of the victims who was looking for justice.  I know it's a reach.  But it's possible.  Wasn't the theory that Jordan Chase killed the accomplices   then fled the country?   Yes.  But even if Chase killed the other four suspects the Butcher still could have killed Chase.  I don't think so.  Jordan Chase was very high profile.  It would be too risky.  Still It's worth looking into.  Find what you're looking for? It says here Price bribed the funeral director to get access to Beverly Grey's body before she was cremated.  He stole a blood sample and ran it for aconite.  Aconite? The queen of all poisons.  Ingesting it causes a heart attack.  Price says it's been growing on the greenhouse property for years.  Poison.  You were right.    Didn't show up on the autopsy?   It wouldn't have.  Not if they didn't know what they were looking for.  Her blood test.  Positive for aconite.  Proof that Beverly was poisoned.  But not proof that Hannah did the poisoning.  Hannah said her handyman was there when Beverly was still alive.  That could be worth a conversation.  Jesus, now she's showing up where I live.    What are you doing here?   You picked the wrong plant.  I knew I could do better.  Hopefully you won't kill it.    What is it?   It's a spotted phalaenopsis.  See the red on the petals? Remind you of anything?   Blood spatter.    Which reminded me of you.  You came all the way out here just to bring me that?   How did you find me?   Google.  Now who's the stalker? I should ask her to leave.  So you wanna come in? Yeah, sure.  I'll help you find a place for it.  I need a spot near a window, but not directly in front of it.  No, that's the bedroom.  No plants in here.  Not enough light.  You could open the shades.  I like the dark.  So do I.  Why is she here? What does she want? There.  Now you can look at it when you wake up and when you go to bed.  Sorry, I gotta take this.  Hey, Deb.  What's up? Nothing, just that LaGuerta might have another theory that could royally fuck us.    Can you meet me?   I'm in the middle of something.  Dex, this can't wait.  All right, I'll meet you in 20.  I'm telling you, Dexter, LaGuerta's not just gonna forget this one.  Jordan Chase is long gone.  So are the others.  There's nothing to trace them back to me.  Are you sure about that? There are no loose ends? What about the person you were working with?   I don't know what you're talking about.    You know what I'm talking about.  There were two vigilante killers, not one.  Who was helping you? She wasn't helping me.  I was helping her.    Was she one of their victims?   It doesn't matter.  If LaGuerta tracks her down, which is next to impossible she won't incriminate herself or me.    How do you know that?   Trust me, I just do.  Motherfucker.  You were together.  Like a couple.  I remember having a thought that whoever was doing this was doing it for love.  That was right after Rita died.  You had that tenant with that weird fucking name.  Lumen.    It was her, wasn't it?   It doesn't matter.  It was.  Jesus fucking Christ, Dexter.  You moved your girlfriend into the house where Trinity murdered your wife   so you could kill together?   It wasn't like that.  I felt guilty about what happened to Rita.  I thought that maybe if I helped Lumen   I was trying to make things right.    Of course.  By murdering five other people.  Why can't the past stay in the past? Do we have to keep talking about this? We do, as long as LaGuerta has a bug up her ass.  Let me worry about LaGuerta, please! You just worry about yourself.  Go out.  Have fun.  Go on a date.  That guy, Sal Price.  He was into you.  Get out of my house.  What did I say? I really need to kill someone.  Hannah's become a real thorn in my side.  Maybe her handyman can give me what I need to finally fix my problem.  Excuse me.  Is Hannah here?   She's at the flower market.    Oh, man.  I drove all the way.  You know when she'll be back? An hour or so.  It might be sooner.  You could wait.  How long have you been working here? About 10 years.  So you knew the previous owner.  Beverly Grey? Hannah said she passed away.  Heart disease.  Sad story.  Yeah, Hannah said they were close.  It must have been hard on her.  I'm sure it was, but she never let it show.    Not the emotional type, huh?   I never saw anything like it.  Even when Beverly got sick, Hannah never complained.  Never asked for help.  Help with what? Taking care of Beverly.  Hannah bathed her, fed her, took her to the doctor's.  All alone? She was stubborn, man.  I figured it had something to do with growing up on a farm, you know? Just ploughing through.  Look, I tried to help out.  Hannah dug her heels in.  Wouldn't let anybody near Beverly.  Which means Hannah was the only one who had the access to poison her.  Hey, Hannah mentioned a purple wildflower that grows on the property.  Thought it would look great in my place.  I'm thinking I could take a look while I wait.  All the wildflowers are over in the southwest corner.  Aconite.  Price is right.  Yet again.  Beautiful and dangerous.  Just like Hannah.  She's harvested it.  Maybe she's set her sights on a new target.  You're after her.  Who's to say she isn't after you? But Why? She doesn't think I'm a threat.  She accepted my apology.  Don't be naive, Dexter.  You think she's a killer but not a liar? Dexter? What are you doing here? I was in the neighbourhood.  Well, come on in.  I'll make some coffee.  Careful, it's hot.  And potentially deadly.  Hannah, I wish I had more time, but I gotta get to work.  You know, I don't understand you, Dexter.  I can't figure out what it is that you really want.    Nothing.  I don't want anything.    You want something.    You keep making excuses to see me.    They weren't excuses.  It's getting creepy that you keep coming by.  Creepy? You came to my place too.  Why don't you just save us both the trouble and spit it out? I wanna take you out.  On a date?   That'll work.    Well, that's sweet.  But I don't date.    I get too attached.    Really?   You don't strike me as the type.    Well, I'm not who people think I am.  So who are you? On the inside? Probably still that 15 year old girl who ran away with Wayne Randall.  The girl who stabbed a woman in cold blood.  Except now I know better.  What do you mean? I mean, he promised me everything.  He was gonna take me to Disney World and Santa's Holiday Adventure.  Some little Christmas themed shithole just outside of Miami.  You know it? It's the only place in Florida where you can see the snow.  I was obsessed.  Then we were gonna live in Argentina on a farm and have this picture perfect life.  Sounds pretty good to me.  Yeah, it was all I could think about.  I longed for it.  I needed it, and I knew that until I had it I would never be satisfied.  The craziest part is that somehow I had myself convinced that Wayne was the only one who could give it to me.  Wayne? Really? Why? I had it in my head that he was the answer.  That he was gonna fill the emptiness that I felt inside.  So I didn't care when he turned out to be the bad guy.  I didn't care if he shot somebody.  I didn't even care if I ended up in juvie.  Not until later anyway.  It was worth it just to hold on to the fantasy.  You still feel that way? No, now I do whatever it takes to make sure I don't lose myself like that again.  But I do still wish I had gotten to see the snow.  You know I'm not Wayne, right? I'm not gonna land you in jail.    I still think it's a bad idea.    Why did you come to my apartment? You know why.  Go out with me.  Come on, I'm just gonna keep stalking you.  I'm just   I'm just trying to do the right thing.  Do the wrong thing.  Fine.  One date.    But if I end up in jail     I'll pick you up at 8.  A date? Really? She caught me off guard.  I had to think of something.  Nadia, it's Joey.  I stopped by the club last night and you weren't there.  I know I've called 50 times.  I'm worried about you.  Please call me back.  Let me know you're okay.  You got a sec?   Not really, I     Do I seem impulsive to you? Jamie says I make bad decisions.  But I have this opportunity, and I'm thinking about retiring.  Holy shit.    You're retiring?   No, I didn't say that.    I'm just considering my options.    Can we talk later? I got shit to do.  Hey, you know Angel's thinking about retiring? Masuka.  Is that true? I wanna buy a restaurant.    Give us a minute?   Yeah.  For the record studies show that men who retire are usually dead in five years.  It's a fact.  Look it up.  Where is this coming from? Is this about Mike Anderson's murder   because we've been through this.    I think I'm burnt out, Deb.  I don't date.  I hardly see my kid.  I'm so focused on work that I forgot to have a life.  And I know this may sound crazy but the idea of buying this restaurant actually makes me happy.  Doesn't sound crazy at all.  Sal Price.  Sal, hey, it's Debra Morgan from   Lieutenant Morgan with the potty mouth.  Right, with the potty mouth.    To what do I owe this pleasure?   Are you still up for that drink? Yeah, absolutely.  But I thought you said   I think I need to get a life.  Yes, you do.    Case number?   Nine eight seven six zero.  That's the Dixon case.  I gotta testify in court next week.  Need a refresher on the evidence.  Dry section.  Bin 51, shelf four.  Third one over.  Back and to the right.    Case number?   Case 16258.  It's Layva.  Should be two or three boxes.  It goes to arraignment next month.  Fuck me.  Oral fixation? Sorry.  Bad habit.  When I quit drinking, I picked up smoking.  When I quit smoking, I picked up chewing on things.  Straws, pens, toothpicks.  Turns out I have a problem with moderation.  Me too.  That and an obsessive personality.  Which is great for work, but it's really shitty for relationships.  Are we talking about me or you? So, what are you working on right now? You're updating your book, right? That and another project.  Which I probably shouldn't tell you about.  Why? Is it a secret?   Because trust me, I can keep a secret.    I don't know.  You're the Lieutenant of Homicide, and when I tell cops about my theories they tell me to go fuck myself.  That won't happen here, I promise.  Come on, don't be a cop tease.  A good theory totally gives me a girl boner.  Okay.  Off the record.  You know that stuff in my book about Hannah McKay being this innocent young girl? A victim of Wayne Randall's influence?   Yeah.    Well, I think it's bogus.  I think Hannah killed her first victim right along with Wayne.  And I think she kept right on killing.  Go fuck yourself.  If that's true, we're fucked.  We gave her immunity.  It's true.  I have evidence to back it up.  It's in my bag right now.  Wait, you have it here?   Why, do you wanna see it?   You have to show it to me.    I'm the Lieutenant of Homicide.    Look at you.  Like a dog with a bone.  If you show it to me, I'll totally make outwith you.  Best first date ever.  Okay.  So these are the spatter photos from the bodies you dug up.  I've seen those.  Dexter said the evidence was inconclusive.  My blood guy disagreed.  Well, there's no way.  My brother's never wrong.  My guy said the pattern on this body indicates a killer much smaller than Wayne Randall.  Smaller.  Smaller like Hannah McKay? Fuck balls.  You gotta be kidding me.  I thought this place was closed for the season.  It is.  So how are we gonna get in? How do you feel about a little breaking and entering? Yeah.  All of us have some kind of longing.  A need crying out to be met.  What is this place? Wait.  Some of us get what we want and we're happy.  The snow.  I thought maybe if you saw it, you could finally get some peace.  Thank you.  Thank you.  But some of us are never satisfied.  When I said I wanted to take you out, this is what I meant.  You said you wanted to see the snow.  This is what keeps me up at night.  This is what I long for.  This is what I need to fill my emptiness.  Do what you gotta do.  Dexter.      Previous EpisodeNext Episode"

No.  These men are dangerous.  You should not get involved with the Koshka Brotherhood.  Don't be scared.  I'm not gonna let anything happen to you.  Where's Nadia? Sirko wants you to lose the evidence linking him to the Colombian murders.    If I do this, Nadia is a free woman.    Deal.  What was Price doing here? He heard we dug up more Wayne Randall victims asked if he could see the files.    I fudged the blood report.    The void pattern on this body indicates a killer much smaller than Wayne Randall.    Smaller, like Hannah McKay?   And I think she kept right on killing.  If that's true, we're totally fucked.  We gave her immunity.  So how'd he die? Your husband? Heart attack.  She killed her husband, I can feel it.  \"Aconite. \" ingesting it causes heart attack.  Do what you gotta do.  Dexter Chemistry.  I've heard some people have it.  An attraction that can't be quantified or explained.  Is that the reason behind this? Loss of control? Maybe the desire to get Hannah on my table was just a way to deny the effect she has on me.  So now what?   How do you like it?   Not much.  You do this to all the girls that you go outwith?   Wrap them up in plastic?   I don't actually go out.  So, what, this whole date thing was just to get me alone so you can kill me? Why? It's what I do.  You kill people.  Bad people.  So you think I'm bad.  You You fit the general description.  You have no idea.  I didn't plan to spend the whole evening talking about Hannah McKay.  Well, what do you wanna talk about? The economy? I don't know.  What kind of music you like? A jailhouse door slamming shut.  That's my idea of music.  I don't know what's driving me crazier, Hannah McKay getting away with a shitload of murder, or you chewing on that straw.  Old habits die hard.  You know, it's gonna be a real downer for your book if Hannah gets away.  People who buy true crime stuff tend to like it when the bad guy gets caught.  Maybe I can help you rewrite the ending.    So now you're an editor.    I'm thinking about Hannah's husband.  Forty year olds don't just drop dead of a heart attack.  I could have the body exhumed, test it for aconite.  It's been 10 years.  If it's there, the tox screen will find it.  The hard part is getting permission.  Hannah's the next of kin, and I doubt she's gonna sign off on it.  She's not the only next of kin.  Hannah's husband had a sister.  Well, aren't you a goddamn know it all?   It's not my only virtue.    That remains to be seen.  Thank you for dinner.    We should do it again.    Yeah, why not? I'll check my notes on the sister and get back to you.  Chemistry deals with the reactions between elementary forms of matter.  Separate the elements, and you negate the reaction.    This can't happen again.    Which part?   The horse tranquilizer?   The sex part.  Yeah, I was thinking the same thing.    Why?   We both know it wouldn't end well.    Just tell me something.    What? You're not gonna try and kill me, right.  I have the right to know.  If I was, we wouldn't be having this conversation.  Let's just think of it as a misunderstanding.  One way to put it.  You know, you don't really seem that shaken up.  You know, for someone who thought she was gonna die.  Yeah, you're right, I suppose I should be a little more freaked out.  Maybe I never really believed that you were gonna do it.  Boy, did he pick the wrong car.  Oh, don't, don't.    It was an interesting night.    That's one way to put it.  You know, you never really asked me why I kill people.  I don't need to.  Price.  The man thrives on stories, and I've just given him a great twist.  If he writes about Hannah and me my career is a memory.  Clouds parted, and much was revealed.  And that would be? Now I know why the blood work on the Wayne Randall spree was so spotty.  You were protecting someone.  As far as Price knows, I'm an innocent lab geek in over his head.    How long have you been seeing her?   What do you want to keep quiet? It's not in my nature to keep quiet about anything.    You can't write about this.    It's nothing personal.    I'm just doing my job.    You'll destroy my job.  Sorry.  No way around that.  You could always go on the record, help me get my facts straight.  I love writing about crimes from the inside.  What if I give you something better? What better than \"Lab tech seduced by femme fatale?\" I was the last one to speak with Wayne Randall.  I could tell you what his last words were.  How he really felt about Hannah.  How do I know you wouldn't be making something up to save your ass? I wouldn't be, but you'd have to judge for yourself.  Either way, I'd be on the record.  I'll give it some thought.  In the meantime, I'll keep quiet about you and Hannah McKay.  Show of good faith.  Between you and me, I'd watch what I eat around her.  I'll be in touch.  As if I needed another reason to stay away from Hannah.  At least I've bought myself some time.    This a good time?   Yes.  My theory on the barrel girl killers went nowhere.  I'm on a dead end on Bay Harbor Butcher.    Shit.    I was thinking we could brainstorm.  I keep wondering if we haven't missed something.  You know, some angle, or   You know, maybe we haven't missed anything.    What do you mean?   Maybe we've been sidetracked by our feelings about Sergeant Doakes.  I think we've been objective.  Well, I guess I'm just not sure, you know? I know what it's like to hold on to an idea of someone, you know? To refuse to believe that they have a dark side but everything we've done, all the evidence it still points to Sergeant Doakes.  At some point, we have to face facts.  It's possible that we've been reaching for leads.  So should we rethink what we're doing here? I mean, I just I don't know if it's worth it.  Maybe you're right.  I'm fucking going to hell.  Sal Price made his living writing about the dark things people do but he doesn't seem to have a dark side of his own.  At least nothing I can use.    You have a minute?   Sure.  What's this? It's your report on the Randall victims.  What about it? There's something weird.  This blood spatter points to a killer other than Wayne Randall.  Someone smaller.  How'd you come to that? Sal Price had an outside lab run an analysis.  They found the discrepancies.    Did you miss this?   Price strikes again.  Where will he show up next? Deb, I didn't miss anything.  I considered the same scenario.  And? Blood spatter is largely a matter of interpretation but I'm convinced Wayne was the sole killer.  These blood drops came from the killer.  You could've tested them to see if they matched Wayne Randall's DNA just to be sure.  But I was sure.  I didn't think the test was worth the time or the money.  Especially since the case had been solved.  Just say what you wanna say.  Hannah McKay killed this woman and you're covering.    Why would I wanna do that?   To save her for your table.  You're wrong, Deb.  If you want, I'll have the blood tested.  Just say the word, we can spend the money.  I'll think about it.  You smell that?   What?   Sulphur, mixed with shit.  Means Isaak Sirko's attorney is on his way.  They wanna run their own analysis on the samples we took from Mateo's.  Confirm that it's his client's blood we found.    Masuka's grabbing it now.    I'll have it ready for them.  That evidence should keep Isaak locked up for a long time.  One less killer to worry about.  I just checked the freezer.  The evidence on Sirko is gone.  Or not.  How in the hell does the most crucial piece of evidence against Isaak Sirko just disappear from our own police station? I don't know.  I logged the blood samples into evidence myself.  There's only one explanation.  The Koshka Brotherhood has a mole inside.  A mole? You read too many spy novels.  Maybe the evidence just got misplaced.  Hey, we do not misplace evidence.  And who reads anymore?   Simmer down, tiger mom.    Masuka's right.  This is why Sirko's attorney asked for discovery.  Evidence would be missing, we'd be left holding our dicks.  We can find who's responsible later.  We have 24 hours to find those blood samples or to come up with new evidence.  And if we don't, Sirko walks.  I'm gonna go check the evidence room log.  See who's been there in the last couple of days.  The crime scene hasn't been released yet.  Maybe we could re collect a sample of Sirko's blood.  Fucking haul your ass over there.  Masuka, Quinn, go with him.  We let a fish this big slip through our net I'm gonna be very unhappy.  You and me both.    What's going on with the restaurant?   I've been approved to take over but I still need a few thousand to keep the place running.    What are you gonna do?   Turn over cushions stand in the corner with a tin cup, I don't know.  Holy shit.  I don't know about the holy, but there's no denying the shit part.  Fucking Koshkas.  They fucked up the sewage line to contaminate the crime scene.  Which means Sirko will be free soon.  And I'll have to kill him before he comes after me.  Need any more proof that there's a mole? I hate to ask, but would you guys take a look around see if there's any blood anywhere that's not mixed with crap'?   I wouldn't get my hopes up.    They do not pay us enough for this.  Quinn, can I talk to you outside? Why don't you guys wait outside while we're in here vomiting? The list of visitors of the evidence lock up in the last 72 hours.    Your name's on it.    So?   So, what were you doing in there?   I don't know, my job, maybe? I'm a detective, I go to Evidence.    What was the case?   The Dixon murders.  I gotta testify next week.  Wanted to make sure I had my ducks in a row.    What you insinuating?   You're dating a stripper that works at a club owned by the Koshka Brotherhood.  So you think I stole evidence for the Koshkas?   Doesn't look good.    Fuck you.  Hold on.  You're no choirboy, but I know you wouldn't sink that low.    Then why are we talking about this?   Because I'm doing my job and I needed to hear it from you.  No, it looks like it was deliberate, Deb.  We're not gonna find any new evidence, at least not here.  We're halfway through another sweep and so far we've got fucking zip.    I don't think you're gonna find anything.    Neither do I.  Dexter, if this case falls apart and Isaak walks   he could be on the street tonight.    I know.    Just have to take care of him myself.    Stay the fuck away from him.  I don't think ignoring Isaak is the right approach.  I'm not gonna ignore him.  I'm gonna put a tail on him 24/7 until his travel visa expires.  He's not gonna pick crust out of his eye without us knowing.  So don't fucking do anything.  I won't.  Except use the time to get Sal Price off my back.  The address for the sister of Hannah's late husband.  Her name's Lori.    Have you ever heard of e mail?   I like interacting face to face.  Especially when their face looks like yours.  You can cancel that shit right now.    You got a problem with compliments?   Yes, when they're slightly cheesy and they come out of the blue, yeah.  I'll try to contact Lori and get permission for the exhumation.    Can I tag along, for the interview?   No.  It's gonna be awkward enough without some goofy writer hovering over us.  Maybe we can meet later and you fill me in.  I did get you the info.  Come on.  It'll be totally off the record.  Fair enough.  But I'm buying.    You all right?   I'm okay.  I thought I wasn't going to see you again.    They hurt you?   No.  They sent me to their club in Fort Myers.  I was so scared.  I thought for sure they were gonna send me back to Kiev.  I'd burn down every one of their fucking clubs before I let that happen.  Oh, my God, Joey.  Did you promise them something to keep me here?   Don't worry about it.    I warned you about the Koshkas.  I can take care of myself.  And I can take care of the both of us.  Look at me.  Very soon, you're never gonna have to work for any of those people again.  I don't understand.    What have you done?   You're gonna be free.  Trust me.  I'm touched you wanted to be part of my welcome back committee.  More like a parade.  Heat like that's gotta make a flight home to Kiev feel pretty good.  Not yet, George.  Miami is still overcrowded, by one.  So you said this was about my brother Jake? Yes.  This may be a little upsetting but we need your permission to exhume his body.  Exhume his body? Why? Evidence has come to light that your brother's death may not have been an accident.  But Jake died of a heart attack.  We believe he may have been poisoned and that his wife was responsible.  Oh, my God.  Hannah? That's what we're thinking.  Did she and your brother get along? Yeah, they seemed to have a great relationship.  Looked like they were totally in love.  Especially after they found out she was expecting.    She was pregnant?   Yeah, she told me in confidence.  I was surprised.  I didn't think Hannah wanted kids.    What happened to the baby?   She lost it.  Right after Jake's death.  It was a miscarriage.  You know, after the funeral, Hannah cut everyone off.  It was like my whole side of the family never existed.  No matter how many times I reached out she just wouldn't reciprocate.  Ms.  Kirkwood, I think we can find out for sure what happened to your brother.  We just need your help.    That looks heavy.  Need a hand?   I need you out of my life.  That can be arranged.  All you have to do is talk to me.  Everything I have to say to you can be summed up in two words     Let me guess, \"fuck off. \"   Glad we got that straight.  I want to write the authorised biography of Hannah McKay.  It'll go through the roof.  God knows I haven't had a decent seller in years.    I need this, Hannah.    Oh, I'm sorry.  I missed the last part over the sound of my heart breaking.  You don't talk to me, you'll force me to speculate.    Maybe even get creative.    It takes brains to be creative.  \"Hannah McKay never lost her taste for killing.  She just updated her technique from knives to poison. \" Just an excerpt from the preface.  Along with some material on one Dexter Morgan   Who's a fan of my work, by the way.     And how he manipulated evidence to help the woman he loved.    I'll deny everything.    Which will be great publicity.  Okay.  Fine, we'll talk.  Just keep Dexter out of this.  Depends on what you give me.  My house, tomorrow, 4 p. m.    Hello?   It's your favourite author.  Decided to take you up on your Wayne Randall offer.    You won't be sorry.    I'll come to your place.  How's tomorrow night sound? Seven p. m. ? Seven it is.  Price covered a lot of murders during his career.  The bloodier, the better.  He likes getting at his cases from the inside.  You can't get more inside than becoming a suspect.  Christy Lawson.  Her killer was never found.  Price wrote a book about her case.  One of his best sellers.  All I need is Price's DNA to link him to the crime.  You should throw that away, Dex.  Hannah needs to know what's going on.  You're looking for an excuse to see her.  You could just pick up the phone.  Christ, Joey.  You're here so often, we gotta get you your own spot.  I did what you wanted.  The evidence against Sirko is gone.  I want Nadia's passport.  She's done with you, and your whole shitty organisation.  Is she?   Yeah, and so am I.    We've been working well together.    Why kill a good thing?   Who do you think you're fucking with? Think I'm some fucking asshole, one of your bag men?   Take it easy.    I could fuck you up.  It goes two ways, detective.  You destroyed police evidence.  That'll get you thrown off the force.  Hell, you'd probably do time.    Stay the fuck away from me.    That's not gonna happen, Joey.  So you think real hard about your next move and what it means for your future.  And Nadia's.  You managed to stay away from me for one whole day.  What happened to our plan? Sal Price happened.    Price?   He saw us together when I dropped you off.  He threatened to put me in his book.  I can't let that happen.  There's more.  He showed up at the Flower Mart.  He wants me to go on record about my time with Wayne or he'll say that I'm a murderer.  I'm gonna handle Price.  Like the way you handled me? Not exactly.  I only go after killers.    Like me.    It's the code I live by.  Code, huh? Sometimes life just has to be taken.  There's no need to dress it up.  It's more than that.  I think you're just afraid to admit that you enjoy killing.  And you don't? No.  Killing for me is just surrendering to nature's way.  Nature adds and subtracts.  Survival of the fittest.  So you're the fittest.  So far.  You ever wonder what it would be like if you didn't have all these rules? Price doesn't have to die.  I can get him to back off for good.  I'm used to dealing with things on my own.  I don't need somebody.  I know you don't.  But I have this covered.  Consider it a good bye present.  Okay.  I suppose we're going for a record.  A record? How many times we can say goodbye for good.  Good bye.  She isn't drawn to my darkness like Lila, or blind to it like Rita and she doesn't need it like Lumen.  She accepts both sides of me.  The whole Dexter.  So why am I walking away from this? Because when some chemicals mix they combust and explode.    You don't have to be here.    He's my brother.  I understand.    You okay?   Yeah.  What the fuck? There's no tissue.    That normal?   It is if the body wasn't embalmed.  Isn't that standard procedure? Unless the next of kin specifies otherwise.    Can we do the tests?   Not on bones, lieutenant.  There's nothing I can do here.  What is it? Your brother's remains He wasn't embalmed.    I don't understand.    We can't run the tests.  So you're saying this was all for nothing? I'm gonna find out what happened, Lori.  I'm not gonna give up.  I can see this was a good idea.    You look like you need a drink.    Yeah, or five.  Excuse me.  Bottled brew for the lady.  Actually, can I get a double scotch, neat, please? When do you get the results for the exhumation? We won't.  The body was more like a pile of bones.  Nothing to test.    Shit.  He wasn't embalmed.    Yeah.  And surprise, it was at the discretion of   Hannah.    Hannah.  Thank you.  That poor woman had to watch her dead brother be dug up.  And for what? I put her through fucking hell.  You couldn't anticipate this.  It's not your fault.  Well, it doesn't make it any better.  Sometimes my job really fucking sucks.  Actually, it always sucks.  Why do you do it? I don't know how to do fuck all else.    I'm sure that's not true.    Oh, God if you are building up to a compliment, now is not the time.  Look.  I'm gonna interview Hannah later.    Maybe I can pull something out.    Gross.  Well, you can tell me how it went over dinner.  I might even let you pay.  Lemonade? I'll pass.  Should we get started? I just wanna make sure that we're clear.  You're going to forget about Dexter Morgan.    He got under your skin, didn't he?   Tell me that you understand.  Never heard of him.  We'll start with the couple from the motel.  I just need enough of Price's DNA to plant at a crime scene.  Traces of blood.  Good for me, bad for his gums.  The more you linger, the greater the chance of being caught.  Crime scene data, audio interviews.  It's Price's research on Hannah.  If I get rid of it, it'll cripple his book.    Maybe kill it.    You didn't come here to protect Hannah.  You need to think about yourself right now.  Wayne gave me the knife and told me to guard the woman.  I figured it'd be easy, seeing as how scared she was.  What was Wayne doing? He started to stab the husband.  Over and over and over.  The woman was screaming like crazy.  The man she loved was getting knifed in front of her eyes.  But he He didn't give up.  He grabbed Wayne and he pulled him toward him.  And then the woman jumped on Wayne.    The woman you were guarding.    Yeah, she was protecting her husband.  I don't blame her, I would've done the same thing.  Keep going.  Wayne was yelling for me to get her off him so I grabbed her by the hair and I pulled her to the bed and she just kept screaming and screaming.  So I stabbed her.  And she just kept screaming.  And there was so much blood.  What did you do? I stabbed her until the screaming stopped.  Take a second.  Looks tasty.  Certainly better than the swill I've choked on of late.  Don't worry, I haven't come down here to cause you harm.  Not yet.  Not with Miami Metro's finest shadowing my every move.  Yes, I certainly hope they are the finest.  For your sake.  What do you want'? So long as I'm waiting around to kill you I thought we might have a little chat.  Good chips.  While I was incarcerated I found myself plagued with a nagging question.  I mean, I will move heaven and earth to snuff out your life because you killed Viktor.  In fact, I was so blinded by my desire for vengeance that you were able to lead me into a trap.  A mistake I assure you won't happen again.  We have a cartoon in America about a Coyote who chases after a Road Runner.  He keeps thinking that.  He keeps rocket skating right off the cliff.  You see, I know what motivates me.  But what I don't know is what drove you to kill my friend.  He killed Mike Anderson.  A man you barely knew for what, less than three months? It's all public record.  No.  You didn't kill Viktor out of vengeance.  I have a feeling that you're a different kind of animal.  The question is What kind are you, Dexter Morgan? The kind who hunted your friend down and strapped him to a board and put a plastic bag on his head and crushed his skull with a fire extinguisher.  The kind who's gonna do the same to you, give or take the fire extinguisher.  You're gonna regret sharing that with me.  For the chip.    This is the last load.    Thanks, Jamie.  You know, you're an interesting guy.  Have a seat.  I should do my next book on you.  Believe me, I know a good story when I hear one.  You know, as a blood spatter analyst, I'm kind of a storyteller myself.  Only difference is your medium's ink, and mine's blood.  Interesting observation.  Before we talk about Wayne, I have a story idea of my own.  Mostly non fiction.  I wanted to get your take.  I'm all ears.  So new DNA evidence pops up in the unsolved murder of Christy Lawson.  You know, the jogger who was killed near Matheson Park.  It turns out that the DNA belongs to a true crime writer.  You said it was mostly non fiction.  Sounds like it's all bullshit.  Well, the anonymous tip is real enough.  The one that mentions Sal Price.  It seems he wrote a very successful book about the same case.  Now it turns out he was her killer.  You have to appreciate the irony.  How do you plan to make this happen, exactly? Let's just say you're gonna need a new electric toothbrush.    You broke into my apartment?   No, I very carefully picked your lock.  It's time to visit the dentist.    You son of a bitch.    Hey, it's nothing personal.    I can't have you messing with my life.    Fuck you! You're not gonna get away with this.  I'm gonna ruin your   Hannah.    Oh, my God, what happened?   Call 911.  911, what is your emergency? I need an ambulance at 8240 Palm Terrace.  Apartment 10B.  Please hurry.  So I came in to see if Dexter was okay, and I saw that guy on the floor.  Dexter told me to call 911, and he started CPR.    Hear anything before the crash?   There was some shouting.  Kind of like an argument.    Dexter's voice?   I didn't recognise the voice.  I administered CPR until the paramedics showed up but he was unresponsive.  Okay, Dex.  I think it's all here.  Hey, were you and Price arguing before he collapsed? The interview might have gotten a little heated.  How heated? He accused me of sloppy work on the Wayne Randall case.  I might have raised my voice a little, that's all.  A contusion to the head.  The source of all the blood.  That's not enough to kill a man.  Okay, wait for the medical examiner to get here, okay?   Why all the blood, Dex?   His head struck the table as he fell.  Jesus.  You Okay? No, I'm not okay.  I can't even have a drink with someone.    You had a drink with him?   Yeah.  He was nice, you know? I liked him.  Did Price tell Deb about me and Hannah? Doubtful.  Deb would have already brought it up.    I can't believe     I'm sorry.    I wish I could tell you what happened.    I know what happened.  Hannah McKay.  She killed Price.  What makes you think that? He was convinced she stabbed one of the victims.  And that she kept on killing.  Her husband, other people.  All with poison.  He was gonna put it in his book.  She poisoned Price.  It's not a coincidence.    How would she pull that off?   I don't know.  I'm gonna pick her up for questioning.  I'm gonna run a tox screen on his body.  She's not gonna get away with it.  Not this time.  Hannah must know that Price's body will be tested for poison.  So why isn't she concerned? Or is she just that good at hiding it? Mrs.  McKay, I'm Lieutenant Morgan.  Do you want anything before we get started? A water? Coffee? Just wanna know what I'm doing here.  Okay.    Sal Price is dead.    Oh, my God.  She is that good.  What happened?   I was hoping you could tell me that.    How can I do that? Ms.  McKay, I was hoping that we could cut through the crap.  Sal Price was writing a book on you.  You didn't like it, so you poisoned him.  That's crazy.  You're a killer, Ms.  McKay.  You're a fucking good one, I'll give you that.  You've gotten away with it for a long time.  But I have a blood report on Beverly Grey that proves she was killed by a plant that grows on your property.  And I have a forensics report on the Wayne Randall bodies that prove that you stabbed one of their victims to death.  I'm not even sure why we're talking about that.  I have immunity for the Wayne Randall killings.  Right, and the Beverly Grey evidence is circumstantial.  Unless I can tie it to the poisons that I'm gonna find in the tox screen that I just ordered for Sal Price.  That is gonna nail your fucking ass to the floor.    I didn't do anything to Sal.    No.  He just dropped dead.  People die.  It doesn't mean they were poisoned.  Is that what happened to your husband? Did he just die? Along with your unborn baby? What the fuck happened, Ms.  McKay? Was he pressuring you to have a family? Was it making you feel trapped? She's not acting.  Charge me with something, or let me go.  I am trying to give you an opportunity to come clean about Sal Price.  You'll be doing yourself a big favour when your case comes to trial.    Am I done here?   Yeah.  You're done.  Trust me.  You know, my grandma has this saying.  \"Trust those who seek the truth but doubt those who say that they have found it. \" My grandma wasn't ever wrong.  Hannah survived Deb's questioning but she might not make it through mine.  Price was going to destroy my life.  I had to do something.  I told you I would take care of it.  You weren't exactly giving me progress reports.  I saw a chance and I took it.    I was doing it for you too.    For me? He died in my apartment! My living room is a crime scene.  You know who I am, what that means to someone like me.  I figured it would kick in while Price was on the road, a convenient auto accident.  How'd you do it? Is it really important?   Is life in prison important?   I'm never going to prison.  Price liked to chew on his pens.  The last one had a little something on it, completely undetectable.    You better hope so.    I know so.  Just wish I could've destroyed Price's book along with him.  Actually, I took care of Price's book.  You what? How? I was at his apartment collecting DNA samples for my now defunct plan to get him to shut up and I erased his research on you.  Thanks.  It only took a minute.  I could feel you watching me while I was being interrogated.    You saw the whole thing, didn't you?   Is it true about your husband? Did you kill him because he didn't want a family? It was the opposite.  I wanted a family and he didn't.  He threatened to leave me unless I got an abortion.    What happened to the baby?   It was a miscarriage.  Sometimes life subtracts.  Sometimes it adds.  Do you realise what happened? We were looking out for each other.  That's big for people like us, maybe even historic.  What's this?   For your restaurant.    It's 10 grand.  You know I got that inheritance a while back.    I've been looking to invest.    I can't take this.  Are you crazy? You too good for my fucking money?   No, this is way too generous.    Bullshit.  It's family money.    You're family to me.    Quinn.  Look, you're stuck with it.  I'm not taking it back.  I do expect a few free meals, though.  This is a loan, you asshole.  I'm gonna pay you back.  Okay, big guy.  We're good.  Report's back on the tox screen on Sal Price.    This can't be right.    M. E.  ran it twice.  Negative both times.  That fucking bitch is gonna get away with it again.  Wayne was yelling for me to get her off him so I grabbed her by the hair and I pulled her to the bed and she just kept screaming and screaming.  So I stabbed her, and she just kept screaming and there was so much blood.  What did you do? I stabbed her until the screaming stopped.  Not only can't I kill her, I can't seem to stay away from her.  Even when I'm not with Hannah, she's there, in my head.  When some elements come together, they create a reaction that can't be reversed.  They transcend chemistry.  Is this what love feels like? Is this how it begins? Am I even capable of this? Hello? Hannah McKay killed Sal Price, and she's gonna walk.  She's gonna get away with it and we both know she's gonna kill again.  Deb, can we talk about this in the morning? He didn't deserve to die.  I can't let this happen.  There has to be some fucking justice.  It's you, Dex.  Me? You know what I'm saying? She deserves it.  I want you to make it right.  Do what you do.

I did what you wanted.  Evidence against Sirko is gone.  I want Nadia's passport.  She's done with you and your whole shitty fucking organisation.  That's not gonna happen, Joey.  So you think real hard about your next move.  I'm at a dead end on Bay Harbour Butcher.  Everything we've done, all the evidence it still points to Sergeant Doakes.  At some point, we have to face facts.  Harrison is only going to Orlando for a few weeks, Dexter.  He's gonna be fine.  All he'll want to do is follow Cody around.  Every time the shit hits the fan, I go to him.  He's your safe place.  You're making it sound like I wanna be with him or something.  Well, do you? You didn't kill Viktor out of vengeance.  I have a feeling that you're a different kind of animal.  I can't even drink with someone without them dying.  Sorry, I wish I could tell you what happened.  I know what happened.  Hannah McKay.

Or does she really want me to kill Hannah? Morning.    How did you sleep?   Okay.  Special herbs from my garden.  It's my secret ingredient.  How can I help? You can dice.  It's more my style.  I sometimes lose track of time, but your calendar goes beyond that.  Oh, it's not so much a calendar but a reminder.  That's the year you took off with Wayne.  It's not about Wayne.  It's Argentina.  What was so special about Argentina? Nothing, really, I just   I like the picture.  It looks like Nice, happy  A home.  My sister, who's also my lieutenant so I should probably get to work soon.  Your sister is the lieutenant? Yeah, I didn't mention that.  No, you didn't.  Is this crazy? \"This\"? You and me, just sitting here, eating breakfast.  I always eat breakfast.  It's important.  I know that we decided to never see each other again so I just want you to know that if last night was a one night thing for you, then I'm okay with that.  Okay.  But if you want to never see each other again tomorrow night then I'm okay with that too.  Okay.  You're very agreeable.  Yep.  I need to find some way to get her out of Debra's head even if I can't get her out of mine.  Hey, come on in.  Do you want coffee? There's plenty.  I couldn't fucking sleep.  Sure.    Deb?   Yeah? What you said last night, you didn't mean it.  Did you? Yeah, Dex, I meant it.  The good news is I've already vetted her for you.  She killed three people that we know of, not including what she did with Wayne.  And Price had a tissue sample and a lab report on Beverly Grey that proved she was poisoned with aconite.  But go figure, some asshole broke into his apartment and disappeared all the files on Hannah.    Thank you very much.    You're welcome.  You don't know she killed Price.  You don't even know Price was murdered.  You want to know what he was doing the day he died? He was recording this.  Then she just kept screaming and there was so much blood.  What did you do? I stabbed her until the screaming stopped.    Deb, she was 15.    You want more? Let's talk about how she didn't allow her husband's body to be embalmed.  She fits your code, Dex.  I'm not killing Hannah McKay.  You know how hard it was for me to ask you that? I have been going around in my head in circles trying to come up with something with anything that I can fucking use, but I've got nothing.  Sal and I were so close.  If that body hadn't decomposed we'd fucking have her.  She'd be locked up.  He would be alive.  But he's dead and Hannah McKay is walking around, free to kill again.  And she will fucking kill again, Dexter.  That's who she is.  And I can't let that happen.  Not after Speltzer.  I wish there was another way.  You're all I have left.  What's up? It's Astor.  \"Grandpa's kidney stones are acting up again.  Grandma's taking him to the doctor.  Hopefully it's not too serious. \" Deb, you told me you didn't wanna be a part of what I do.  Before I realised   You could hardly live with yourself when you lied to Batista for me.  How will you live with knowing you're responsible for a murder? Don't tell me what I can and can't handle.  Turns out there's a fuck of a lot that I can live with these days.  No, you can't.  Ever since you found out, you've been teetering on the edge.    You've covered up evidence, lied     For you.  That's why I can't let you take it any further.    For your own good.    For my own   ? Oh, please, do not parent me, Dexter.  You sound like Dad.  Because that's probably what he'd say.  This isn't who you are.  Deb, I care about you too much to let you do something you're gonna regret.  I'm sorry, the answer is no.  Well, I guess it's your fucking decision, isn't it'? Even though everything I just said is true it doesn't make me any less of a liar.  Excellent.  The police will follow Jurg and your bodyguard around all afternoon.  And then what? The cops are dicks, but they're not morons.  They'll figure out you're not in the car.  Eventually, sure.  But by then, I'll have taken care of my business.  Business? What business? This isn't about Dexter Morgan again, is it? You're not thinking straight here.  He works for Miami Metro.  We take out one more of theirs, they shut this place down for good.  We have inventory to move tonight.  Come on, man, just let it go.  Go home.  Deb's got 24 hour police surveillance on Isaak which means I know where he is at all times.  He's moved into Viktor's apartment and hardly gone anywhere other than The Fox Hole and a few restaurants.  Hey, Dexter.  The usual? Yeah, thanks.  Do you have any Boston creams? It's my sister's favourite.  Got some fresh ones coming out now.    Take just a minute.    Thanks.  Is that your plan to keep Debra from going over to the dark side?   Give her a massive sugar rush?   I don't exactly have a plan yet.  I can think of an obvious one.  I'm not gonna stop seeing Hannah just because she's a murderer and my sister wants to kill her.  Do you hear how that sounds?   What the hell?   I don't know.  Those fucking gang kids are at it again.    Yeah, I guess so.    I'm calling the police.  While you played house with Hannah, Isaak found a way to shake the police which likely means he'll come after you again.  Well, if he can get past Miami Metro Homicide, so can I.  Grandpa's gone to surgery.    We have to stay with you.    Shit.  What?   The kids are coming.    Kids as in plural? Grandpa has to have surgery.  I need to send Jamie to Orlando to pick them up.  It was Isaak, wasn't it?   How did he get away from the cops?   Does it matter?   Did you see him?   Yeah.  Then you're a fucking witness.  I can arrest him.  You already tried that once.  It didn't work.  You really want an investigation into why Isaak Sirko is trying to kill me? So, what the fuck am I supposed to do? Just let me handle it.  It's not like I have much of a choice.  Just be careful, okay? There's one other thing.  I got a call from the kids' grandmother.    Harrison okay?   Yeah, he's fine.  But Bill has to have emergency surgery and Maura wants me to watch Harrison and Astor and Cody for a few days.    Now is not a good time.    I know, but what could I say'?   Jamie's picking them up.    They can't stay at your apartment.  Isaak probably has his own key by now.  Any ideas? Yeah, they can stay at my place.  I'll get patrol cars to cover my house, just in case.  How are you gonna explain that to LaGuerta? I'll tell her that I'm afraid lsaak's gonna come after me for his arrest.  Your house isn't exactly kid friendly.    What does that mean?   Well, you have a gun.  I'll lock it up.  And the pay channels.  Cody's 12.  Okay, I'll lock up the remote.  Anything else? Anything in your kitchen besides salsa and beer? There was some cheese when I moved in.  I'll have Jamie stock the fridge.  This is gonna be great.  I love kids.  I don't love kids in general, but I love your kids.  And Astor and Cody, it's been a long time.  I'll give you a heads up when I know when they're getting in.  Thanks.  Yeah.  What's that? I'm gonna pay Hannah McKay a visit.  Why? Just because you're not gonna do what you do doesn't mean she gets to live happily fucking ever after.  I guess it was foolish to think Deb would simply walk away from this.  Hey, I heard about your donut shop.  Oh, yeah.  Pretty scary.  Francisco thinks it was gang related.  Showdown between the crullers and the fritters? Deb, if you need me, I'll be on my cell phone.  Something UP? Just some business on the other side of town.  Dexter.  Ladies.  If you get a chance, stop by Papa's after work today.    It's under new management.    Shut up.  You got the restaurant? The landlord and I came to an agreement with the lease.  Call me Papa.  No, I will not do that, but I will stop by for a drink later.    Dex, you're in?   No, I've got the kids coming into town.  It's a family place.  Bring them.  Angel.  I'm really happy for you.  One cubic yard of cocoa mulch, Let me get back to you.  Lieutenant.  You in the market for some orchids? I'm not buying anything from you.    Look, I think you have the wrong idea     Shut up.  I'm not interested in anything you have to say, because you're a fucking liar.  I know who you are.  I know what you are.  Well, I think you'd be surprised at the things that you don't know about me.  Sal Price shared everything with me.  So you may think you're safer because he's dead, but actually it's worse.  He was just a writer.  I'm a cop.  Whatever you're hiding, I'll find out.  Sal Price was a storyteller.  He wanted to sell books.  He didn't care if they were true or not.  You admitted to him on tape that you killed with Wayne.  How convenient that he died before he had a chance to write about it.  Lieutenant, what were you doing when you were 15 years old? I'm guessing you were probably on the soccer team or something, right? Me, I was just some dumb farm girl who was wakened in the middle of the night by an older boy that I had a crush on who said, \"Let's go on a trip. \" I was in over my head.  You knew exactly what you were doing then.  You're in over your head now.  Well, I don't know why I care so much about what you think but somehow I do, so I'm sorry.  You haven't even begun to be sorry.  I'm not suggesting a coup here.  More like a realignment.  I'd never do anything without the support of the Brotherhood but I feel like something has to be done or this whole thing's gonna explode in our faces.  Okay.  Consider it done.  You wanna stick around? Watch your girl? Drinks on me.  I've got a better idea.  Why don't you go fuck yourself?   Come on, Joey.    No, don't \"Come on, Joey\" me.  We had a deal and you fucked me over, so we're done.  Look, I'm sorry I couldn't get you Nadia's passport.  I tried, man, but the guys in Kiev, they pull the strings.  What I do have is some cash.  If you do one more job for me, you can buy something for Nadia.  See, I don't want your fucking cash.  And if you take that out on her I'll have ICE down here faster than you can count checking on the immigration status of all your employees.  So go fuck yourself.  Bye.  Miami Metro believes they know where Isaak is at all times but obviously I can't count on that.  Hope he enjoys his last meal.  When he gets home to Viktor's apartment, I'll be waiting.    Hey, Jamie.    Hey, Dex.  We just made a quick pit stop.  I warned Cody about the Big Gulp.  But we're about three hours out depending on traffic.  Great.  Why don't we meet at your brother's new restaurant? If he's got macaroni and cheese, we'll be fine.  Apparently that's all Harrison's willingly consumed   since he got to Orlando.    It is his favourite.    God, Cody, we don't want to stop again.    But I'm thirsty.  Can't we leave him by the side of the road? No, Astor, we can't just leave him by the side of the road.  Sounds like you got your hands full.  We'll see you in Miami, Dexter.  Drive safe.  People always say they'd like to die at home.  I'll leave his body here and let the police blame it on the Colombians.  Who the hell are you? I'm the building super.  I came to fix the faucet.  I didn't know anyone was home.  You're not the super.  Sure I am.  Who are you? I'm the Avon Lady.  Well, that's just silly.  You're here for the same reason I am.    Which is?   To kill Sirko.  Look, I don't know who sent you here but I'm not going halfsies with anyone.  This is my job.  We could have just gone halfsies.  With all the people who want to kill Isaak why is it so hard to get him dead? Not this guy.  This one either.  Dexter Morgan.  This guy had a slip.  Had? Meaning he doesn't have one anymore? No, he moved a few years back.  I remember because it was odd.  He had eight months to go on his lease.  When exactly did he move? May, 2007.    Are you sure?   Yeah.  You're getting heavier.  What did they feed you up there? Mac and cheese.  And more mac and cheese.    Wanna play on the beach after we eat?   Oh, I can take him now.  Astor and Cody were fighting the entire drive down.  I need a break.    Mojitos on the house.    All right.  For the grown ups.  Sodas for the kids.  Sorry, I gotta keep my liquor license.    Everything good here?   It's perfect.  Thanks, Angel.  Perfect because it has a built in security system.  Dexter, check out my \"Angry Birds\" score.  Dexter doesn't wanna see your \"Angry Birds\" score.  Put it away.    I've missed you guys.    We missed you too.  So how's school? ls math still kicking your ass? Butt.  Kicking your butt.  That's what I said.  ls math still kicking your butt? I'm a year ahead in math now and I'm taking A. P.  Bio.  Impressive.  She passed out when they dissected the fetal pig.  Can we not talk about fetal pigs at dinner? Can we not get through dinner without you doing something disgusting? Can you stop acting like Miss Perfect? You can't even make it through a weekend without smoking pot.  Oh, my God.  You know how many cops are here?   You wanna get arrested?   God, what is wrong with you? Guess I should go talk to her.  I'll be your backup.  I don't do it a lot, I swear.  Just when I get really stressed out.  You wanna tell me what's going on? It's just pot.  In some states, it's not even against the law.  It's always against the law for someone your age which is for your own good, by the way.  Thanks for the public service announcement.  Dexter's right.  Sometimes things that seem like a good idea in the moment are things you'll end up regretting later.  Astor I know how certain vices can be used to relieve stress.  But sometimes those vices can cause more problems than the original stress.  Okay, I get it, pot is evil.  Are we done? Sure, we're done.  Kids are all asleep in your room.  I put Harrison on your bed.  I hope that's okay.  Yeah, sure.  He doesn't wet the bed, does he? Not always.  You owe me.  Jamie will be here first thing in the morning.  Hey, Dex maybe you were right about Hannah.  I mean, don't get me wrong.  If anyone deserves what you do, she does.  But it must have been hard to resist and I know you did it for me.  So thanks for caring.  You don't have to thank me.  Thanks for taking everyone in.  My home is their home.  My family .  All that's left of it is here, under one roof.  It should feel like home.  So why do I want so badly to be somewhere else? Look who's not here again.  Is this a bad time? Fortunately, you've managed to catch me in between gentleman callers.  Well, I guess it's my lucky night.  What brings you DY? Or is this your version of a booty call?   What's a booty call?   Seriously? Actually, I just stopped by because I'm gonna be busy for the next few days.  So you came by to see me because you can't see me? Something like that.  So, what's got you so busy? Nothing, I just The head of the Koshka Brotherhood wants to kill me.  You're not kidding.  Well, I don't know what a Koshka Brotherhood is, but it sounds bad.  It's kind of Ukrainian mafia.  What did you do to piss them off? Not them.  Just Isaak Sirko.  He has this personal vendetta against me.  Why? I killed one of his key guys.  Well, it happens.  So, what do you know about this Isaak Sirko? I know that he wants to kill me and that I need to kill him first and that it's harder than I thought it would be.  Well, you want my advice? Sure.  You spent a lot of time finding out all about me before you   Before I tried to kill you.    Right.  This is different.  I had to make sure that you fit my code.  I already know lsaak's a killer.  Still, it seems like you have a system and it's working for you, right? Most of the time.  Well, so why don't you try the same thing on this guy? Figure out who he is and why he really wants to kill you.  Here.  Take my van.  He might know your car.  Besides, it'll give you a decent excuse to come by and not see me again.  I have never been able to talk to anyone about my kills before.  Not like this.  No judgment, no fear, no panic.    That's nice.    Yeah.  I'm kind of tired of talking.  Maybe I can show you what a booty call is.  Come on, Joey.  It's not that bad.  I only have to work for George for two more years.  Then I'll have my freedom.    You believe that?   He likes his dancers young.  There are always more girls who want to come here.  I'm sorry I let you down.  Just promise me you'll never do anything for them again.  Not even for me.  I promise.    Okay, I'm gonna take a shower.    Okay.  How'd I know I'd find your horny ass here? I got something to show you.    I'm not interested.    Oh, I think you might be.  But Isaak Sirko, he wants you to lose the blood evidence linking him to the Colombian murders.  Let me skip to the good part.  If I do this, Nadia's a free woman.  You give me her fucking passport, understand? Deal.  And I'll do you one better.  You can even keep the cash.  Now do we understand each other? If I go down, you're going down with me.  It won't exactly ruin my reputation.  I got the Koshka Brotherhood behind me.  You saw how long Sirko stayed behind bars.  Who's gonna save your ass? Miami Metro? What do you want'? Same kind of shit you used to do for us.  We have some product that needs to move.  I need a cop around to make sure nothing goes wrong.  If you help us, you make some money.  And if you don't, that recording goes on the fucking cloud.  I'm sorry to twist your arm, buddy, but you really left me no choice.  I'll see you tonight.  No one else here.  Not anymore, anyway.  Do you recognise him?   He's one of George's men.    Sent here to kill me.  George wouldn't make a move without getting approval from the boys in Kiev.    So much for brotherhood.    This can be fixed.    We can go home, we can call     No.  I'm a dead man there.  You've already gone above and beyond the call of duty, Jurg.  Your loyalty could get you killed.  Where you go, I go.  My offshore accounts should last some time.  But I won't have access to the corporate accounts.  Bloody hell.  Then there's this.  We're gonna need another place to stay.  Who do you think killed him? Well, that's a job for the police, isn't it? Why don't you go and give our friends downstairs a call? Looks like the gang's all here.  So you have no idea what he was doing in your apartment? Not a clue.  But I'm sure your trusty blood spatter analyst could figure it out.  Mr.  Sirko, the gun that we found would suggest that he came here to kill someone.  And since you live here, that someone may very well be you.  What a frightening thought.  Then perhaps I need some sort of police escort.    Oh, I already have that.    We'll have to confirm with the ME but judging by the lividity and state of rigour I'd estimate the time of death as sometime yesterday afternoon.  Let me see.  Now, where was I yesterday afternoon? Perhaps these kind officers could refresh my memory.  Unis tailed him all day.  He wasn't here.  Seems I have an alibi.  I hope they're trustworthy.    Dex, what have you got?   Yes, please, Dex, tell us your theory.  I'm so curious.  Well, judging by the photo found in the victim's pocket he was lying in wait for Mr.  Sirko.  Here you go.  These scuff marks indicate a struggle.  They fell to the floor.  And then the killer cut his carotid artery with one swipe of a very sharp knife.  My, my  You couldn't have described that better if you'd been there yourself.  Thanks.  I have plans with the kids today.  You think you can finish this up? Fine, but one of these days, I'm gonna track down some of my kids   so that I can skip out on work.    Thanks.  Vince is gonna take it from here.  Keep him occupied as long as you can.  Kill you later, Isaak.  Yeah.  Oh, that's gonna be really good.  See, get it all up in there.  Yeah.  That's a strong castle, mister.  You're doing so good.    Want that?   He did it all himself.    That's pretty awesome.    Yummy.  You know what? I think you need a little bit more sunscreen, Harrison.  Hey, buddy, you know what this place needs? A moat.  Keep the bad guys out.  I'll be back in a minute.  Can I have some of that leg? I miss the beach.  It reminds me of Mom.  Yeah, she used to take you guys here all the time.  Atlanta doesn't feel like home, but here doesn't either.  It's like there's no place I actually belong.  You know what I mean? Actually, yeah, I do.  If my grandparents find out about the pot they'll think I'm just turning into my dad or something.  I feel like they're just waiting for that to happen anyways.  You know, when I was younger, someone told me who I was and I pretty much took his word for it.  If I'd taken the time to decide for myself I would have turned out different.  Different how? I don't really know, but I kind of wish I did.  For the record, you didn't turn out so bad.  For the record, the pot will stay off the record.  Just give me a sec.    Hey, Hannah.    Hey, I'm sorry to bother you but I accidentally left my greenhouse keys in the van.  I'm kind of in the middle of something.  I could bring them by in a few hours.  Just tell me where you are and I'll swing by.  Home Beach.  Tower 1.  Okay, great.  I'll call you when I get there.    Is this the one?   Yeah, thanks.  So, what are you doing out here? Hey, Dexter.  Look.  Oh, right.  Of course.  I should've seen that one coming.  No, she's not   She's my nanny.  Your nanny? Yeah, that little guy is my son.  Harrison.  He's 3.  I told you about his mother, how she passed away.  The other two are Astor and Cody.  They're my step kids.  They live in Orlando with their grandparents.  Harrison lives with me most of the time.  I'm sorry.  I should have told you.  You didn't trust me or you were afraid it would push me away? Maybe a little of both.  Well, I'd love to meet them sometime.    You're lucky, Dexter.    Lucky? No matter where I go I'm Hannah McKay, the spree killer's girlfriend.  Nobody has a clue who you are.  You get to have this normal life with kids and Is that something you want? It was, once upon a time.  Wayne and I talked about having 10 of them.  Could you imagine what a train wreck that would have been? Then when I got married to Jake, I thought: \"This is how it's supposed to be,\" you know? But when that whole thing went to shit I just figured it wasn't really in the cards for me.  That's what I used to think too.  Dex, get over here.  Well, I won't intrude.    Enjoy your time with them.    Okay.  Hey.  Everyone asleep? Yeah, finally.  Dexter, you did not tell me that bedtime is, like, this two hour process.  And that reading those Dr.  Seuss books out loud is really fucking hard.  Sorry I missed that.  Teenagers are great.  You tell them what to do.  I mean, my house has never looked so clean.  I love families.  Does Hannah fit into my family somewhere? What's that doing here? I borrowed a oar from a friend so Isaak wouldn't recognise me.  Does that friend happen to be Hannah McKay?   I was going to     Oh, my God.  Are you fucking her?   I can explain.    I know what fucking is.  No explanation necessary.  Is that why you wouldn't kill her? Partially.  I am the biggest asshole on the planet.  All that bullshit about you caring about me too much to let me do something I would regret? I fucking bought it.  Deb, everything I said was true.  Yes, I didn't kill Hannah because I have feelings for her but that doesn't make what I said to you any less true.  Feelings? Are you in love with her? I don't know.  Is it because she's a serial killer? Does that turn you on or something? What do you all do, sit around and talk about who you're gonna take out next? Oh, my God.  Price? Did you fucking help her with Price? No.  I don't even know why I fucking ask you, Dexter.  Every time I think I know exactly who you are you tell me something worse.  Being with Hannah is worse   than being a killer?   Yes.  No.  I don't I know you're not gonna stop killing.  I mean, you've made that very clear.  But you can stop seeing her.  I don't wanna stop seeing her.  Look what happened to her husband, Dexter.  She doesn't have the best track record with men.  I don't even want to talk about the fucking body trail that you've left in your love life.  I'm not asking your permission, Deb.  So you don't care what it does to me?   I don't want to hurt you.    Well, guess what.  You did.  You picked the one way that you could hurt me worse than you could ever fucking understand.  You told me you accepted me being a killer.    If you love me, you'll accept this.    If I love you? If I love you.  I went to the church that night that you killed Travis Marshall to tell you that I'm in love with you.  You're in love with me? Fuck.  Oh, my God.  Was.  I don't even know if I fucking like you.  Just Forget it.  What do you mean, you're in love with me? I didn't mean to say that.  I don't I know it's weird and it's gross and it's fucked up, but And I know you don't feel the same.  I don't even know if I feel the same.  It's one thing to be in love with your brother but it is a whole other level to be in love with your brother who's a goddamn fucking serial killer.  You're a serial killer and I'm more fucked up than you are.  Well, aren't you gonna say anything? I'm sorry.  I don't know what to say.  Oh, God, you never do.  Will you please just go? I really   I can't look at you.  Are you gonna just keep following Isaak around all night? I can really use a kill tonight.  After what just happened with your sister? She's not She's not in love with me.  That's insane.  You have to admit, it explains a lot.  Why she didn't arrest you.  Why she keeps believing all your lies.  Why she's willing to give up everything she believes in for you.  What am I supposed to do? I can't feel what Deb wants me to feel.  You don't even know how she wants you to feel.  You just left.  She asked me to leave.  Dexter calm down.  Oh, well, you know what I do to calm myself.  Where is Isaak going? Looks like a bar.  I'll give him half a dose, walk out the back so the police don't see me.  I'll look like a friend walking his drunk buddy to his car.  He could be leading you into a trap.  Not to mention, the police are only 100 feet away.  What a pleasant surprise.  We both know you can't kill me here.  Oh, I can.  But I won't.  Has to be some vestige of civility left even in this corner of the world.  You call shooting at me in a donut shop civil? I was short on time and opportunity.  Barman, can I have a beer for my friend, Dexter Morgan? Now we can both relax.  Unlike most places on the planet, everyone's welcome here.  You thought your enemies wouldn't follow you into a gay bar? No.  I thought I'd feel comfortable in a gay bar.  Ironic, isn't it? I always feared the Brotherhood would learn my secret and turn against me.  Now they've turned against me anyway, and none the wiser about this.  I will have to thank you for slitting that assassin's throat.  You might have saved my life.  But you must explain to me your aversion to guns sometime.    It's complicated.    I can imagine it is.  You should cut your losses, Isaak.  Go back to Kiev.  There's nothing waiting for me back in Kiev except for a large, well staffed house and an attractive secretary who occasionally pretends we're an item to keep the rumours from circulating.  The one thing that made my life worth living in Kiev you tossed in the ocean a few weeks back.    You and Viktor were     Lovers.  More than that.  You took from me the one thing that money and power can't bring back.  And now thanks to you, also the luxuries are gone too.  Not because of me.  Because of this vendetta you're holding on to.  And what did you do to the man who murdered your spouse? Nothing you wouldn't have done.  Nothing I wouldn't do a thousand times over again.    Did it help?   She's still dead.  I can see that Viktor meant a great deal to you but he was a killer and he got what he deserved.  My wife was innocent.  And if she weren't, you'd feel the same.  That's how love is.  It's a powerful weapon.  It can work for us or against us, can't it? I don't understand much about love.  Well, that's because you're a scientist.  Love defies reason.  Nothing defies reason.  Logically, Viktor and I shouldn't have been together.  I mean, aside from the obvious social stigma Viktor was impulsive, foolhardy even.  Always out to prove something.  I suppose the heart knows something that we just don't know.  Or maybe the heart is just wrong.  Oh, I doubt that.  Love can be inconvenient, perhaps inappropriate.  It can be dangerous.  Make us do things we wouldn't dream of doing.  But wrong? That just depends on where we end up, doesn't it?   We don't have to do this.    I do have to do this.  And then what? Then? Well, I hadn't really thought about it.  Suppose I'll take my funds, find some little attractive corner of the world and while away my days in comfort and anonymity.  Argentina.  Actually, I was thinking more like Micronesia, but each to their own.  We're outsiders, you and I.  On the periphery.  Watching everybody else.  Pretending we're just like them, but knowing we're not.  Best we can hope for is to find a place where we don't have to pretend.  It's a shame, really.  Under different circumstances, I think we could have been great friends.  Till next time.  Everyone wants an Argentina.  A place where the slate is wiped clean.  Isaak, I'm at the airport in Miami.  I'll be home soon.  Isaak, I'm at the airport in Miami.  I'll be home soon.  But the truth is Argentina is just Argentina.  No matter where we go, we take ourselves and our damage with us.  So is home the place we run to or is it the place we run from? Only to hide out in places where we're accepted unconditionally.  Places that feel more like home to us because we can finally be who we are.      Previous EpisodeNext Episode"

        "script": "Previously on Dexter Miami is still overcrowded by one.  I'm not suggesting a coup here.  More like a realignment.    Do you recognise him?   It's one of George's men.  Sent here to kill me.  So much for brotherhood.  This guy had a slip.  Dexter Morgan.    Are you sure?   Yeah.  Chief Lane has somehow come to learn about my indiscretions.  He's asking me to retire.  He thought that I ratted him out.  We both know it was you.  This is how the game is played, Morgan.    I don't owe you shit.    Not the way Isaak sees it.  He did you a favour by taking out those Colombian scumbags.  So, what do you know about this Isaak Sirko? I know that he wants to kill me and that I need to kill him first.  I have never been able to talk to anyone about my kills.  Not like this.  You should cut your losses, Isaak.  Go back to Kiev.  The one thing that made my life worth living in Kiev, you tossed in the ocean.    You and Viktor were     Lovers.  You took from me the one thing that money and power can't bring back.  Till next time.  I know who you are.  I know what you are.  I think you'd be surprised at the things you don't know about me.  Being with Hannah is worse   than being a killer?   Yes! Feel like if you love me, you'll accept this.  If I love you? I'm in love with you.  You're in love with me? Will you please just go? I really   I can't look at you.  There are no two stronger human emotions than fear and love.  In many ways, they're not so different.  Both can make you do crazy things.  Tell your own brother you're in love with him.  Put your life at risk to hunt down the man who took away your beloved.  Could you maybe not do that turny thing?   How you doing back there?   Oh, you know, I'm fine.  Or do something that scares you to death because you may be in love.  I didn't think it was gonna be this choppy.  Turn into the waves.  Otherwise it's worse.  Well, I wouldn't want that.  You know, could we maybe stop for a minute? We don't have to do this.  We can go back.  No, no, no.  I just need a minute.  I thought I'd outgrown this.  When you said your nanny was taking the kids back to Orlando a morning on the ocean alone sounded\u00e2\u0080\u009c.  better in my head.  LS your   ? You're shaking.  You always been this afraid of the water? Since my father thought that the best way to teach me how to swim was to march me down to the local pond and throw me in.    That's horrible.    Yeah.    Where was your mother?   She was right beside him.  She noticed pretty quickly that something was wrong but he wouldn't let her come to me.  He wouldn't save you? Six years old and I already knew what it felt like to be dying.  I came to on the dock.  A fisherman heard my mother screaming.  A complete stranger saved my life instead of my father.  Have you ever been that scared? Not   Not really.  You've never felt that at all? It's okay if you have.  You can talk to me about this kind of stuff.  I know.  It's work.  There's a body.  I have to get back.  Okay.  You're positive? After George's attempt on your life the brotherhood has taken matters into their own hands.  They've sent two men to kill you.  They're most likely already here.  Who? Mickie and Caffrey.  You know there's still time for you.  You don't have to stay.  I'm not going anywhere.  You're safe here for now.  They won't be able to trace this room to you.  Your phone.  I've made both these men very rich when I required their services.  Let's see if they're as loyal as you.    Oleg, it's     Isaak.  Good to hear your voice.    How's your mother?   Good days and bad.  So I hear you're in town.  Don't suppose we can talk about this.  I've already accepted the contract.  What's done is done.  Right, then.  We'll see you soon.  We're gonna need some help.  Hannah keeps wanting me to open up get to know the real me.  The only problem is I'm not so sure there is such a thing.  Relax.  You're safe.  As for me, I wish I could say the same thing.    What are you doing here?   Circumstances have changed greatly.  Koshkas have sent two of their own to kill me.  Need your help to stay alive.  I'm feeling rather exposed out here.  We wouldn't want these two men to know where you live now, would we? You don't seem like someone who needs help.  Even a man dangling from a cliff will stretch out a hand to his worst enemy.  Where's your assistant? As resourceful as Jurg is, he's of no use to me now.  These men know who he is.  What I need is the element of surprise.  And that, Dexter is you.  You're scared.  If you knew who these two men were you would be too.  What's in this for me? Your life.  I'll take my chances.  Very well.  If the enemy of my enemy is my friend I should be rooting for the men who want Isaak dead.  But crazy as it sounds, I'm not.  Maybe because I still want Isaak for myself.  Or that he and I are more alike than I want to admit.  Know what would be great at the restaurant? S'mores.    The ones you make at your own table.    Don't mention the restaurant.  Health inspector stopped by.  How can you think of food with this? Four violations and seven days to fix or they're gonna shut me down.  Mind if I take a look? I'd rather you not.  At least till I'm done here.    Little heads up next time?   What would be the fun in that? Arson investigator.  There's an empty canister of accelerant under the passenger seat.  I'm detecting an oily residue.  There's also an ID badge.    What do we have here?   Watch.  Holy filet o fuck.    Who are you?   See, it never gets old.  Phil Bosso.  We met a while back.  That church burning?   Have an ID?   Danny Yamiro.  Paralegal.  Badge says he works downtown.  Think you got a suicide here.  Hara kiri.  Self immolation.  What is it with my people? First in math, first to check out.  It's actually self incineration.  Immolation is a form of sacrifice by any means.  Isn't restricted to fire.  Well, excuse the fuck out of me.  Hey, what about the backseat? The burn rate behind the driver's side is different than the rest.    Are you sure it's a suicide?   You're the blood guy?   Right.    Exactly.    Crime scene's all yours.    Thanks.  Let me know what you find.  Gonna have unis canvass the area.    I can do that.    No, no, I got it.  Deb's been afraid of her feelings consuming her.  If I can't find a way to extinguish them, I'm afraid she might be right.    Deb, wait up.    I have to get back to the station.    What you said     I don't wanna talk about this.  I'm glad you said it.  How? When every second of every day, all I wanna do is take it back.  Because on some level, I've always felt the same way.    You don't have to do this.    I do.  I am your brother, and I love you.  Just not in the same way you think you love me.    Dex     And it's okay.  I understand.  It makes sense.  It's logical.  Like The way I love M&Ms, even though I know I shouldn't.  M&  fucking Ms? I'm trying here.  Just hear me out.  Why, Dexter? It's sure as shit not logical.  Consider everything we've been through.  You are the one person on the planet who's been down the same road.  Same road, very different cars.  Deb, we've always been the one constant thing in each other's lives.  It's like you and I we endure.  Maybe that's what love is.  Endurance.    You think you're in love with me.    Please stop saying that.    But it's gonna be fine.    No.  It's   Logical.  Because it is.  You're not crazy.  Fuck.  That, coming from you Should make you feel better.  It does.  God, Dexter.  You, me, Dad.  It's like Mom got cancer to take the easy way out.  I don't know.  Maybe it's better that it's out there and it's not controlling me anymore.  Do you feel that way about your secret? Not really.  Deb? Hannah? I saw your van outside.  Are you   ?   Here?   Dexter.  You're just in time for tea.  Hope you don't mind, I let myself in.  That's far enough.  I just want to talk.  Where's Hannah? Jurg's been keeping tabs on you.  For me.  Your comings and goings.  Where you spend your nights.  Seems this Hannah's quite important to you.    Where is she?   I assure you she's perfectly safe and quite comfortable.  Jurg is seeing to that.  Let her go.  This is between you and me.  Not quite.  There's the small matter of the two men who want me dead and your stubborn refusal to help.  You asked me what was in this for you.  Well, if your life doesn't matter I'm betting hers does.  Well, I guess I have no choice but to take you up on that tea.  Splendid idea.  I have a better idea.  I kill you, and leave you out for the Koshkas to find.  Yes, you can do that but that leaves Hannah with Jurg.  I'm afraid he's not as honourable nor as forgiving as I am.  What makes you think Hannah means anything to me? Well, if she didn't, I'd be dead by now.  You have the wrong guy.  This isn't what I do.  You killed Viktor as well as the man waiting for me in my apartment.  He had a gun, you had a knife.  I think I have the right man.  And if I help you, then what? You get Hannah back and I walk away from Miami and from you.  No matter what you may think of me or my methods I'm a man of my word.  I need to know she's alive.  Hannah, I trust you and Jurg are settled in.    Why are you doing this?   The reason, my dear, is right here.  Dexter.    Don't worry.    That's enough.    Now, you behave.    No, wait! Dexter   Your life is in his hands now.  Listen to me carefully.  Scream, make noise, I hurt you.  Try to escape I hurt you badly.  Clear? Here.  Find something for us to watch.  And none of the American reality shit.  Here.  Oleg Mickie.  Ex military.  Efficient, methodical.  Which is why I've employed him more times than I can count.    And that one?   Benjamin Caffrey.  He's a Yank, like you.  Out of New York.  Less reliable but, as you can see just as deadly.  Any weaknesses? I need to know everything.  Caffrey likes it up close and personal.  Knives, piano wire.  And as you saw he's a vicious little cunt.  Whereas Mickie doesn't like to get his hands dirty.    Guns?   High powered ri\u00ef\u00ac\u0082es specifically.  He's a slave to ritual.  He'll buy a rifle locally and be compelled to test it out first.  Point of a rifle is to hit a target from a long distance.  The range would need to be outdoors.  That's his favourite.  A Savage Arms 110 sniper rifle.  Most ranges don't sell the kind of magazine rounds this one uses.  That's where I'll start tomorrow.  Well, just where are you running off to, all helter skelter? I'm hungry  You've been tasked with helping kill two men.  A loved one's life hangs in the balance, and you're hungry?   It's late.    Let me ask you a question.  Just how many men have you killed? A lot.  I asked Mickie the same question once.  He answered 16.  And the bastard was almost pounding his chest.  But you you don't seem to revel in what you do.  Why? You trying to have a moment? I don't bond.  Most men kill for money.  Some for the sheer brutality.  Others like me, revenge.  But you, Dexter with everything I've put you through I get the sense you could walk away without the need to kill me.  My needs are different.  Why do you do it? Why are you a killer? If anything happens to Hannah, you'll find out.  I need a favour.  Okay.  If you do me one and watch where you're dripping.  Isaak Sirko.  What about him? Call off the 24 hour surveillance.  Like hell I Will.  What the fuck is going on? Someone's after Isaak.  Two someones.  You know, like the guy in his apartment but worse.  Actually, much worse.  So you want me to pull the surveillance so the two someones can do what they're hired to do? Not exactly.  Well, then I'm not pulling the surveillance.    He'll come after you.    No, he won't.  Because he and I are working together.    Are you out of your fucking mind?   lsaak took Hannah.  He got wind about these two guys coming after him and he took Hannah as leverage against me.    He's gonna kill her if I don't help him.    And I should give a shit why? Because I do? Dexter, you don't have to save her.  You shouldn't even be with her.  It's not even like you will have a fucking future.  You're both what you are.  I don't know what's in our future.  I don't want Isaak to kill her, that's all.  Right now.  Who do you think has her? His assistant.  Jurg.  If I can find out where, Isaak won't have any more leverage on me and I can kill him.  Well, how do you expect to find Jurg if you're hanging outwith Isaak? I'll figure it out.  You know what happened this morning? I was lying in bed, staring at the ceiling feeling the sun, and listening to the waves, and For a second, everything was just like it used to be.  Steaks and beer and bad movies on the couch.  And then I blinked.  And now it's burritos and hired killers and favours and Xanax to get me to tomorrow morning so I can have that half second of peace.  I'll pull the surveillance but don't you ever expect me to be okay with who you're doing this for.  Deal? Deal.  Tom.  And a great creature arose from the depths.  Tokyo's that way, Maria.  Nice to see you too, Tom.  I thought I'd stop by and see how you were doing.    I mean, it's been a while.    Bullshit.  Now, you have exactly the time it takes for me to finish my drink to explain why you're really here.  Little early for Scotch.  The joy of retirement.  I have no place to be, no one cares what I do.  If I'd known you were dropping by, trust me, I'd have made it a double.  So? I think the Bay Harbor Butcher is alive and well and still in Miami.  Clearly I'm not the only one who's been hitting the sauce.  Doakes was the Bay Harbor Butcher, end of story.  I found a blood slide at a crime scene exactly like the ones we found in Doakes' car.  Bad people are still going missing, and Doakes never had a boat.  Here is a list of Miami personnel who still do.  Oh, and I'm on it too.  Are you fucking kidding me, Maria? Torn, you know I have to follow every lead.  You sound like a real cop.  Except a real cop would've remembered my hernia operation.  And after the surgery I could barely lift my ass out of a chair let alone a dead body.    You check the dates against the kills.    I will.  Since I'm here, do any of those names look familiar? Go home, Maria.  The only help you'll get from me is a lift back to Cuba.  Only two firing ranges outside of Miami sell high calibre rounds and this is the only one near the airport.  But the target I'm interested in isn't out there.  It's beside me.  Mickie is dead.  Fast work.  I see I chose wisely.  You're not out of the woods yet.  When he finds out his partner's dead, Caffrey is gonna be harder to kill.    What does he know about you?   Everything, I suppose.  I'm sure the Koshkas would have saw to that.  What if he knows you're after me and can't track you?   He'll come after you hoping to find me.    So let's let him.  You're willing to be bait? You're the one who wanted the element of surprise.  I got your text.  What's going on? Unis found Jurg's car at a park, but it was abandoned.  That's all I could find.  You're not supposed to be finding anything.  I told you I've got this.  You've got this? It sounds so casual.  Facts without emotion.  That's pretty much how you've always seen the world.  Pretty much.  Except when it comes to Hannah.  Will we be getting a call about a body? No, it's outside of Miami Metro jurisdiction.  That's good.  I guess.  How do you know that Isaak is not gonna kill Hannah anyway? I don't.  And if you find Hannah and you take care of Isaak, then what? Well, according to you, Hannah and I don't have a future together.  I had no right to say that.  And it wasn't out of spite.  Fuck, I don't know, maybe it was out of spite.  I don't even know anymore.  It's just I'm saying this to you as your fucking sister and nothing else, okay? Dex, she is a killer.  You will never be safe with her.  You're safe with me.  Promise me you'll think about what I said.  I Will.  Breathe.  What the fuck? Aren't you supposed to be hunting down Isaak? Hey, I can't reach Mickie.  I think Sirko got to him.  Great.  That's just fucking great.  You realise he'll be coming after me if this goes sideways? Then I need a way to find him.  Morgan.  I wanna talk to Hannah.  She hasn't been harmed.  I've done everything you've asked, but I need to know she's still alive.  And figure out where she is.  Has anyone ever told you you've got serious trust issues? Is it over? Not quite.  Put Hannah on.  Someone wishes to speak to her.  Hey.  Hey, my God.  It's so good to see you.    Has he hurt you?   I'm fine.  So those Ukrainians you were telling me about? This would be them.    Everything's gonna be okay.    I know.  I'm sorry they're using me like this to get to you.  Don't be.  It's not your fault.  Well, it doesn't matter anyway.  Just do what you have to do, okay? I want you to take me out on that stupid boat of yours again.  Promise? I   I miss you.  Likewise.  Touching.  I have to get back to work.  If I had the chance to speak to Viktor again and he told me he missed me I think I'd like to think I could come up with something better than \"likewise. \" I'm not you.  Yeah, but there she was, trying to comfort you and you just couldn't manage to do the same.    Why do you even care?   Well, look around.  There's no one else here for me to talk to because of you.  Viktor got exactly what was coming to him.    Fuck you.    That what these questions are about? Wondering what kind of killer I am, trying to decide if I should die   because of what I did to him?   He was my life! But still you sent him to Miami.  You put him in over his head.  You put all this in motion.  And now you're terrified, Isaak.  You're terrified that I'm not really responsible for his death.  That you are.  No.  You're the reason he's gone.  If you really believed that, I'd be dead by now.  Go.  Hey, Quinn, it's me.  I'm having a real shitty day here.  So how about you return one of my fucking calls?   Go get changed.    My shift just started.  Yeah, well, we're gonna take a break.  Your boyfriend's got me in a mood.  Viceroy's just down the road.  We had some good times there, right? I'll get my things.  Isaak is consumed by guilt, drowning in grief.  He'll never recover.  You took the risk.  How did you know he blames himself for Viktor's death? I did the same thing with Rita.  Even though it was Trinity who killed her, I still felt responsible.  Now it's happening all over again with Hannah.  If something were to happen to her, and it's my fault   will I end up like Isaak?   You recovered after Rita.  Barely.  Harrison reminds me of her every day.  But with Hannah It feels different.  I've spent my entire life trying to mask who I am Wha'[ I do.  But she sees through it all, and accepts that part of me.  So where's the problem? If we get through this maybe it's the human side of me that'll push her away.  Juan Pablo.  It's a Colombian soccer player.  The men Isaak killed in that bar were Colombian.  And dead men don't return home.  It's the last place these killers would think to look for Isaak.  And the perfect place to hold Hannah.  Dex, grab your kit.  We got another burn victim near the university.  It's the man Isaak showed me.  Caffrey.  He's taken the bait.  I need to keep him close but not too close.  Fucking mould.  With all that it's gonna cost me, the universe is giving me the finger.  And with proper lubrication, nothing wrong with that, hombre.  Yo, Dex.  You wanna join the party? Victim's name is Leo Santolongo.  He's a grad student.  One punch away from getting free coffee at the student union.  What the hell? Two burning men in two days.  Looks to be the same accelerant  Petroleum based.     As your car victim.  Same oily residue.    Another suicide?   Typically with a suicide by fire the gas or fuel is poured over the head, like so.  This fire's point of origin was front centre mass.  It burned upward and downward.  Can we close the doors? This void.  It's the same thing that happened with the first car victim.  We have a phantom.    Bobby.    Maybe the victim was letting us know who did this.  Or was it the last person he was thinking of'? You Okay? Never seen anything like this.  If this was a person then they'd have to be wearing some kind of protective suit.  He blocked the victim from escaping and watched him burn alive.  Oh, it's not as horrific as one might think.  Destruction of vital tissue, nerve endings quickly induce shock or asphyxiation making the event relatively painless.  Relatively.  I need my camera.    What does he need his camera for?   Evidence we have a killer using fire as a weapon and a first name.  Bobby.  Wonderful.  Quinn, is there a security camera on this level? Yeah, one.  I'll get the tape from the company.  Well, if there's no blood, I'm gonna head back.    Vince.    Yeah, I've got it, Exter Day.  How can there be only one security camera in this entire lot? Deb, you got a minute? Be right back.  Who's Juan Pablo? He plays for the Colombians.  You remember Mateo's Bar? Yeah, the three Colombians Isaak killed? Yeah, I grabbed this off of his phone.  I think Hannah's being held at one of the dead men's homes.  I'll look into it.  But that's all, and thank you.    Dexter.    Your man, Caffrey?   He sees you?   Yeah.  I'm leaving a crime scene now.  Lead him to the port.  Pier 18, northwest corridor.  There's a cargo ship, the Fearless.  It's one of ours.  I'll be waiting there.  This is George.  How can I help you? It's Caffrey.  Did you find Isaak?   Please tell me that fucker's dead.    Not yet.  I'm tailing Morgan.  Any reason he'd be headed down to the port? We got a boat down there.  You think Isaak is luring Morgan to him? That's what I'm hoping to find out.    Hi.    Hey.  Joey, what are you doing here? I was on my way from a crime scene.  Thought I'd see if you can get off early.  No.  George wouldn't be happy.  Fuck him.  Can't one of the other girls cover for you? Hey.  ls everything okay? Yes.  Please, just go.  Well, did something happen? Would you please talk to me? This job is hard with you and the things that are expected of me.  I don't have a problem with you working here.  Promise me you won't be upset.  Depends on what it is.  Nadia, what happened? You fucked my girl? Technically, if the dancers are on the clock, they're my girls.  Maybe you'd know that if you ever returned my fucking calls.  You left me high and dry tonight.  That's gonna stop.  You could learn a thing or two from her.  She takes her job very seriously.  You're gonna be sorry! Piece of shit! Consider that her fucking notice.  Come on.  Really? Cornflakes? Again? That's all there is in the cupboard.  Eat.  How about you let me introduce you to some good old Southern cuisine? My grandma has this great recipe for fried green tomatoes.  It's amazing.  I saw some tomatoes growing in the garden out back.  I can't let you outside.  Okay, fine.  You pick them, then.  It's not like I'm going anywhere.  Well, just remember, not too ripe.  I think I'm on to something.  One of those Colombians was single.  The other two lived with their family or an apartment.  But he has a house on Coral Road.  I'm heading there.    Deb, no.    I don't wanna hear it, Dexter, okay? And just so we're clear, I am not doing this for Hannah.  I am doing this so you don't end up dead.  If you catch Isaak first, so be it.  You kind of need to hurry.  I'm leading one of these guys to Isaak now.    Please be careful.    I was gonna say the same to you.  That's the plan.  Sweetheart.  See? A man of my word.    Here you go.    Thanks.  Your assistant told me I'd find you here.  We need to talk.  About what? The horrible things you said to me? You cost me my job, Maria.  Was nine months shy of a 40 year pension before you stuck the knife in.  Before you could return the favour.  It's not my fault I beat you at your own game.  So why don't you take your own advice? Go home.  Now, why would I wanna do that if I'm here to help? Don't fuck with me, Torn.  That little list of yours? You'd be surprised what I know about some of the names on there.    Which names?   Oh, not so fast, no.  I help you, you support my reinstatement.  Just long enough for me to get my pension bump.  Boats are fucking expensive.  So the question, Maria is how bad do you want this? Looks like a table just opened up.  Careful, they're hot.  Isaak hasn't checked in yet.  If anything has happened to him it would be a shame to kill you after a lovely meal.  Well, let's hope that doesn't have to happen.  In case you want some more.    Water.    I'm sorry.  Grams always went heavy on the pepper.  Never cared much for that man.  We should go before we're spotted.  So this is over? And still you don't trust me? Well? You can talk.  The knife? How'd that get there? In the water.  I'll do the same.  Fine.  Together, then.  You go ahead.  I'm gonna hose this down to be safe.  I'll wait for you below.  Isaak was right.  I could have walked away if he'd let me.  But I was wrong about him.  I never thought he would.  What the hell happened to you? Well What are you waiting for, you little shit? God.  Don't move.  I can get you to a hospital.  The bullet's still inside.  We both know I'm a dead man.  There's a kit in my car.    I can help with the pain.    No.  I need you to do me one better.  Fuck.    Dispatch.    This is Lt.  Morgan requesting backup.  And a fucking ambulance at 2085 Coral Road.  We're sending someone right now.  Sorry for the bumpy ride.  You're forgiven.  We're here.  Indulge a dying man.  What do you intend to say to Hannah when you see her again? I guess that I'm sorry.  You guess? Fuck's sakes, Dexter.  She needs to know how you feel about her.  It's not that easy.  How is it you can be absolutely fearless in the face of death and yet so afraid to live? I'm not afraid.  Then what is it? Death has always calmed me.  It's soothing.  Predictable.  Inevitable.  With a knife in my hand, I feel it's mine to control.  It gives you intimacy.  Yes.  But it never lasts.  It's over then you move on.  But now, with Hannah I feel like I don't have any control and I'm not sure I wanna move on.  I was like you.  So detached.  Until Viktor.  Was it worth it? Your feelings for him cost you everything.  Oh, God, yes.  Being with him I never had to hide.  I was finally Alive.  There's hope for you yet.  Watch any Western, and you'll know a man out for vengeance should dig two graves.  One for his enemy and one for himself.  I won't be needing mine.  But I'll see to it that Isaak isn't alone in his.  And you have no idea why you were taken by the deceased? No.  He barely spoke.  So he chained you up, you got free he stabbed you, and then you beat him to death.  As I stated, it was self defence.  Oh, I know.  Still, there was a lot of blood.  I mean, I know it's not the first time you've gotten your hands bloody.  Are we finished? I wanna make sure what you're telling me reflects what really happened.  But, yeah, sure, we can be done.  How is it that you were the one that found me? I'm a cop.  It's my job to follow through on anonymous tips.  Where was your backup? Lieutenant's prerogative.  Doctor said I was in pretty bad shape when you found me.  Yep.  So given your feelings about me, why not just let me die? I was doing my job.  Was it because of Dexter? No.  I think it's about fucking time I start doing things for myself.  Maybe you can be fine with being responsible for someone's death but I can't.  That's That's not who I am.  I got here as fast as I could.  Everything taken care of? All taken care of.  Then I guess I'll go.  You gonna be okay? Yeah.  I'm gonna be fine.  It's only 12 stitches.  I'm gonna be out of here tomorrow.  God, you're shaking.  When you asked me on my boat if I'd ever been scared like that, I have.  Twice.  When I was 3, seeing my mother murdered.  And when I realised these past few days that I might never see you again.  Well, that wasn't so hard, was it? I don't know.  I'm not sure what this is exactly.  Or what's coming.  Maybe that's how it's supposed to be.  Out of my control.  All I know is that when I'm with you, I feel safe.      Previous EpisodeNext Episode"

        "script": "Previously on Dexter Our primary suspect is Sergeant James Doakes.    Doakes?   He is not your man.  I think the Bay Harbor Butcher is alive and still in Miami.  Doakes was the Bay Harbor Butcher, end of story.  I found a blood slide at the crime scene like the ones we found in Doakes' car and Doakes never had a boat.  Here is a list of Miami Metro personnel who still do.  Its point of origin front centre mass burned upward, downward.  Can we close the doors? This void, it's the same thing that happened with the first car victim.  \"Bobby\"? Maybe the victim was letting us know who did this.  You fucked my girl? You could learn a thing or two from her.  She takes her job very seriously.  You always been this afraid of the water? Ever since my father thought the best way to teach me how to swim was to march me down to the local pond and throw me in.    That's horrible.    Six years old and I already knew what it felt like to be dying.    Look, I think you have the wrong idea.    Shut up.  I know who you are.  I know what you are.  Dexter, you don't have to save her.  You shouldn't even be with her.  It's not even like you have a fucking future.  All I know is that when I'm with you, I feel safe.  I saw a man, he was coming through the flames.    He was wearing a silver coloured suit.    Our Phantom Arsonist.    He looked like an alien.    Or a monster.  I swear, he was 7 feet tall.  Monsters, aliens, phantoms, none of them are real.  The thought that an actual person could do this is too awful so our imaginations create a way to make it easier to take.  But the strongest of imaginations can't protect us once we know the truth.  I called you last night.  Wanted to go over the case.    We can go over them now.    Where were you? Oh, you were with Hannah.    Find anything? DNA? Prints?   Nope, nada, zip.  Same accelerant as the other four fires, though.  Kerosene.  He left another \"Bobby\" in the soot.  Fuck, that's five Bobby's in two weeks.    He's gotta be signing his name, right?   Only thing that makes sense.  None of the victims were named Bobby, but fuckload of good that does us.  There are thousands of Bobs and Roberts in Miami.  What do we know about the latest victim? Mom took her daughter to the bathroom.  Both went up in smoke.  Kid was 6 years old.  What kind of sick fuck does that to a 6 year old kid'? Maybe the kind who isn't bothered by the sight of a dead child.    Hey.    Hey.  How you feeling? You get your stitches out? Yeah, I'm gonna have a really sexy scar.    How was your day?   It was fine.  You don't sound fine.  The Phantom started another fire today.  it killed a mother and child.    What?   Why do I get the feeling you wanna wrap him up in plastic? It doesn't matter.  I promised Deb I wouldn't take any cases from the police.  If you always listened to Deb, you wouldn't be here.  I can't kill him, okay? Okay, fine.  Sorry.  I'm just \"frustrated.  As much as I wanna be here my Dark Passenger wants to be somewhere else.  I'm sorry.  Your \"dark\" what? My Dark Passenger.    That's what I call my need to kill.    Why? It's like this thing living inside me telling me what to do, saying I have to kill not leaving me any choice.  You're not a puppet.  Of course you have a choice.  Actually, I don't.  Come on, Dex.  It's just you.  You want the arsonist dead.  And I don't blame you.  Who wouldn't?   It's not the same.    What do you mean? Ignore that.  I wanna understand this.  How is it different? A lot of people feel they wanna kill, but I have to follow through.  I follow through and I don't have a Dark Passenger.  You don't get it.  I'm trying to.  But, no, I don't get it.    There's a man in the window.    What?   Hi, banana.    Oh, my God.  That's my dad.  I'm sorry if I surprised you.  I didn't even know Hannah had a boyfriend.    I haven't spoken to you since     Go ahead and say it.  Since before I went to prison.  Clint McKay, convicted felon.  Nice to meet you.  No need to get nervous.  I was just in for cheque kiting and I got out early on good behaviour.    Dad, what are you doing here?   Well, let me just get to the point.  I don't know what Hannah's told you   about me.    Not a lot.    Well   Just that you almost let her drown.  Well, the truth is I was a real, genuine asshole of a father.  And I needed to admit that to you in person.  Can we please not do this in front of Dexter? If you two are together, then I want him to hear this.  I spent a lot of time with a prison shrink, working through my issues.  It's important to take responsibility, so that's what I'm here to do.    Okay.    Now, I don't expect you to forgive me.  Don't see any reason that you should, not after everything I put you through.  But it's important you know no matter what, I always loved you.  I always will.  I've got something for you in my truck.  Let me give it to you and I'll be on my way.  Surprise.  It's your dollhouse.  Repainted and rebuilt.  It was in your Aunt Cindy's garage.  I figured you loved it so much as a kid, you might like to have it now.  Dex, give me a hand? Well, I guess I'll be on my way.  Let you two get back to your dinner.  There's a diner at the Purple Flamingo, where I'm staying.  They say they make a pretty decent burger.  Okay.  Okay.  Well, I guess I'll see you around then.  Nice to meet you, Dexter.  You look good, banana.  Happy  Glad to see you're doing okay.  I'm sure he meant well, but he could not have given me a worse gift.  Brings up so much shit.  What kind of shit? When I was 8, he took me to a poker tournament.  Lied to my mom and said that we were going to a county fair and stashed me in a motel room.  Went to play cards and didn't come back for three days.  That's awful.  When he came back, he brought the dollhouse bragging about a big win, saying he'd never leave me again and making promises that things would get better.    And did they?   No.  Of course not.  I don't know.  I'm He's trying, right? Maybe Maybe this last stint in lockup did him some good.  Yeah, maybe.  Most likely we're looking for a male suspect.  Egocentric, manipulative.  Possibly in or on the outskirts of law enforcement.  He's methodical.  Fastidious in his appearance, poor social skills.  This list is by no means comprehensive.  Should give you an idea of what we're looking at.  Bosso's profile of the Phantom, he may as well be describing himself.  An arsonist who works for the fire department.    It's almost too easy.    What else? Hands on learner.  Prone to self aggrandisement.  Thank you, Investigator Bosso.  Where are we on tracking the suit? There's at least a hundred sites that sell that on the Internet.  Almost impossible to trace.    Are you interviewing witnesses?   Nobody's seen the guy's face.    More coming.    Let me know what you find.  Simms, Miller, any leads from the tip line? None so far.  Mostly girlfriends trying to get back at their exes.  Keep at it.  Maybe something will come through.  This fuck has killed seven people in two weeks.  Let's stop him before he makes it to number eight.  Hannah's wrong.  Of course I have a Dark Passenger.  There's no other way to explain this compulsion.  I hope she knows what she's doing.  Who's sending you hugs and kisses? No one.  Bullshit.  That was a girl.  Was she sexting you? You got pictures? Come on, I gotta restock my spank bank.    Angel, know about Dexter's girlfriend?   Hannah McKay?   How did you   ?   Jamie told me.  My man.  Hannah McKay.  Yeah, that is so awesome.  Excuse me, what is awesome about my brother dating a killer? You guys heard Sal Price's recording.  Hannah confessed.  Come on, she was 15 when she did that.  When I was 15, my parents thought that I was retarded.  Hey, hey  I get it.  Hannah is an attractive girl.  But you should probably be careful.  Yeah, you should definitely be careful of getting burned because she's so freaking hot.  Can I see you in my office, please? I didn't realise you and Hannah McKay had gone public.  We hadn't until a minute ago.  That's kind of dangerous.  Don't you think? Dating someone so notorious when trying to stay under the radar.  I don't wanna talk about Hannah right now.  Can you just leave it? Fine, yeah.  I'll butt out.  I mean, we're all responsible adults, right? You live your life, I'll live mine, and Hannah will live Hannah's.  Great.  You'll leave Hannah alone? I'm saying that I'll stay out of your relationship.  I'm not gonna let her get away with murder again.    That's not what I meant.    Dexter, I am fucking serious.  I have compromised the shit out of myself for you.  I am sure as fuck not gonna do it for Hannah McKay.  Fine.  I get it.  Why are you standing here? We have a Phantom to catch.  She did say \"we. \" Philip Bosso.  In his last 27 arson investigations, he found the fire's origin point.  Either he's great at his job or all he had to do was look in the mirror.  Okay, it says here that you work as a janitor at the Y in Brickell Bay where the Phantom set the first fire.  Did you see anything suspicious when making your rounds that night? No, I didn't even know it happened until I saw the fire truck.  It was horrible.  Right, right, right.  And did you see anyone in a fireproof suit? Don't you think I would've told you if I had? Bosso's SUV.  But where did he go? Is he about to strike again? Electric fuses and camping fuel.  What are you doing here? That's not a fireproof suit.  Dexter, you a Civil War re enactor too? You here for the battle?   Yeah.    Which side are you fighting for?   The North.    Oh, why you blue belly.  I should buck and gag you right here.  Were you there last weekend at the sixth Maine battery cannon firings? No, damn.  I guess I missed that one.  It's a whole weekend affair.  I was in charge of special effects.  Ground, air bursts, artillery fire.  Which explains what's in his car and gives him an alibi for Saturday's fire.    Wanna see some pictures?   You bet.  Bosso's not the Phantom.  He's just strange.  But if he didn't set those fires, then who did? Hang on just one sec.  I guess coffee went better than expected.  After coffee, Hannah wanted to show me the flower mart.  So we're walking around and I catch a whiff of this flower.  It smells just like liquorice.    I ask Hannah what it is   And I tell him it's anise.  So I tell the lady in the booth that her anise smells delicious.  You didn't pronounce it right.  Don't know what I said, but she did not react well.  Well, do you blame her? Sounds like you had quite a day.  Yeah, we really did.  How long are you gonna be in town? Oh, just another day or so.  And then I'm off to Louisiana.  What's in Louisiana? A poker tournament? No.  I am all done with that.  I am looking for an honest way to make a living.  And I think I found the perfect thing.  You ready?   Crawfish.    Crawfish? Yeah, a crawfish farm.  I got a line on one near Lafayette.  Gonna call it Big Clint's Crawdaddies and I will ship them fresh anywhere.    There's a market for that?   You bet there is.  Hey, ain't nothing like a crawfish boil.  Weddings, bachelor parties, Fourth of July.  Everybody likes crawdads.  Well, I'm excited for you, Dad.  And I'm proud of you.  Well, thank you, honey.  Means a lot.  Why don't you check out of that motel and come and stay with me? You're starting a business.  You're gonna need to save.  No.  I couldn't do that.    I wouldn't wanna intrude.    Oh, you're not.  Yeah.  Don't worry.  I was going home tonight anyway.  Why don't I bring you guys breakfast? Best doughnuts you ever tasted.  Okay.    What are you doing, man?   Get out! Everybody, come on! Come on! Come on! Man, it's like I died and went to heaven.  I think if I had one more of those, I probably will.  I'd like to make an orange juice toast to the cutest damn couple I have ever seen.  Outside of me and Bubba in prison.    That's just a little joke.    Right.  Well, to you, Dad.  The king of crawfish.  There's no stopping me.  I just gotta get the money together.  So where are you at with that? That's something I wanted to talk to you about.  Figured you might like to get in on the ground \u00ef\u00ac\u0082oor.    What do you mean?   Well, invest.  I only need about 20 grand more.  No, it's a great opportunity.  There's a guaranteed 10 percent a year back on investment.  I'm sorry, Dad.  I can't.  My money's tied up in the business.  Oh, come on, now.  Not all your money.  There's gotta be a little wiggle room there somewhere.    You could re mortgage your place.    I don't think so.    Gotta be worth a pretty penny.    It's not gonna happen.  Well, fine.  Whatever.  Forget it.  I'm sorry.  I just don't have the funds.  What kind of daughter won't even help her own father? Jesus, Dad.  Look, I need some air.  I'm gonna go for a drive.  Dad, you don't have to go.  You think I was wrong telling him I couldn't?   Of course not.    But I feel like I should help him out.    Why?   Because he's my dad.  The same dad who almost let you drown? Who left you alone for three days? He's trying to change.  I doubt it.  I know he's done some bad things, but there's good inside of him as well.  Right, you've known him for 24 hours and you think you understand him?   I have a sense for this thing.    Oh, yeah, you and your Dark   Whatever   Part of you.    That you don't think exists.    Because it doesn't.  I gotta go to work.  It's the arsonist again.  Look, I'm just trying to help here.  I know.  I know.  I appreciate it.  I'm sorry.  I'll be fine.  Go.  Okay.  I gotta check.  Sorry what happened to your sister.  Another \"Bobby. \" \"It's Bobby. \" He added an \"it's. \" Like we didn't know it was Bobby.  Make sure you get this.  Well, did you see anything? I really have no idea.  Did you see Bosso?   Sniffing the body.    Probably for accelerant.  Still, it was kind of creepy, right? I mean, I know it would be the biggest clich\u00c3\u00a9 in the world the arson investigator turned out to be the arsonist, but does he? Does he set off anything in your brain? I don't think Bosso's the Phantom.  He has an alibi.    You vetted him?   I looked into him.  You said you weren't gonna take any cases.    I didn't take it.    Fuck, Dexter.  Why put yourself in that situation? Good question.  Why did I? Hey, L. T.  We got a security camera.  I'm gonna take the hard drive see if we can get eyes on the Phantom.  Good.  We could use a break.  Hey, Hannah.  Wait, hold on.  Slow down.  What happened? I'll be right there.  What happened? I came back from the flower mart and it was like this.  Well, I had a couple of drinks to take the edge off but I might have overdone it a little.  You did this to get back at me for not giving you the money that you wanted.  Oh, talk about paranoid.  But then, maybe you've got reason to be.  Must be a lot of folks hate you for all the pain you've caused.  How can you even say that to me? Playing Mother Nature in here with your stupid, little flowers.  Won't even help out your own fucking father!   I don't wanna help you!   You got any idea what it's like to be the father of the infamous Hannah McKay? You're a goddamn curse, you ungrateful little shit! That's enough, Clint.  Stay out of this.  This is family business.  You know you killed your mother, don't you? She died of a broken heart after your spree   with Wayne Randall.    I'm sorry.  Everybody would've been better off if I'd let you drown that day at the pond.  Get out of here.  Now.  Fine.  I said what I had to say.  Well, it looks like Hannah's found herself another winner.  You two deserve each other.  I can cut a body up into pieces but how do I help Hannah put herself back together? Could you have picked more of a dump? Come on, Maria.  It's perfect for all this cloak and dagger bullshit.  It's the kind of place you take hookers and ugly broads.  So nobody sees you.  You should know.  I followed up on all the names you identified on my list.  Yes, the list of suspicious police employees   who own boats.    They were all dead ends.  All except for Dexter Morgan who conveniently moved his boat when we were closing in on his marina during the official investigation.  You really think Dexter is the Bay Harbor Butcher?   It's worth looking into.    No, it's a waste of time.  Now, start thinking logically.  If Doakes really wasn't the Bay Harbor Butcher that means somebody probably framed him.    Right.    That same person killed him the real Bay Harbor Butcher.  So the best thing to do is to look into Doakes' final days.  We should start with the cabin in the Everglades.  Where Doakes died.  Makes sense.  First let's eat.    Okay.    Waiter.  You went all out.  Well, you had a rough night.  I figured you could use a pick me up.  Sit.  You were right about my dad.  I'm sorry I was.  I just   I feel like such a sucker.  I don't fall for anybody's bullshit, but when it comes to him, I   I get it.  Fathers can be complicated.  I just don't understand why I keep holding on to this idea that, underneath it all, he's a good person.  Maybe because the idea that he's not is just too hard to take.  I just hope he's gone for good.  You sure scared the shit out of him.  That voice.  I hadn't seen that look on your face since you took me to see the snow.  Is that what you were talking about? Your Dark Rider? Dark Passenger.  Fine.  it sounds a little silly when you say it out loud.  No, I get what you mean.  You do seem like a different person so it makes sense that you would name that part of yourself.  Does it just take over? Where do you go? Does Dexter Morgan just disappear? No, I'm still there.  Do you hear a voice, or   ? Not exactly.  It's more like a . \u00e2\u0080\u009cneed.  So it's just like a feeling.  Well, I should get to work.    Unless you need me to   No, I'm good.  I got pancakes.  The good news is that we have the Phantom entering the bus.  The bad news is that he never shows his face.  My promise to Deb is getting harder and harder to keep.  This is more than just a feeling.    There's no way to ID him?   I didn't say that.  Right there.  He grabs a rail bare handed.  We might have a print.  Pull the fucking print off the rail.    We might get lucky and get a match.    Let's go, bro.  Hey, baby.  What's up? What? Motherfuck.  I'll be right there.    What's wrong?   Novikov's sending Nadia to Dubai.  He's holding her.  I gotta get her out.    Alone?   Got no choice.    He's putting her on a flight tonight.    Let's go.    Where do you think you're going?   I'm here to see George.  Why don't you stay here with me? Well, well, if it isn't Sir Lancelot.    Where's Nadia?   Nadia? Let me get her for you.  She's got something to tell you.  Get over here.  All right, tell your boyfriend who you belong to.    Let her go.    Tell him.  Fuck you.  You touch her fucking again, you're dead.  Oh, what are you gonna do? You're gonna shoot me in my own club? Fuck.  Don't move.  Nadia, get behind George's body.  I want you to take this gun, Nadia.  I want you to shoot me in the arm.  Okay, sweetie? It's okay.  Shoot me in the arm.  What the   ? Are you okay? He pulled a gun and shot me.  I had no fucking choice.  He just grazed me.  Christ.  Go to the safe.  Get your passport and the money and go.  What? She's a witness.  I'm not gonna let her take that money.  She's earned it.  She can't be a witness.  The Koshkas will kill her.  And she's here illegally.    I'm sorry.    It's okay.  Go, go, now.  So did you find a match? We'll see.  I'm running the Phantom's prints through AFIS now.    Nothing.    Fuck me.  So, what now? You hand the whole thing over to me and let me take care of it? I can't stop thinking about this Bobby thing.  You know, that somehow that's the key.  It's a kid's name.  Nobody calls an adult Bobby.  He wrote \"it's Bobby\" on the bus.  Like Astor and Cody blaming each other.  \"it's Astor. \" \"it's Cody. \" The fires have to do with his childhood? Could be.  Maybe his urges started back then.  I wish we could run that print against juvie records, but that shit's sealed.  Back to square one.  Not for me.  Government workers never miss a break.  There's your Phantom.  \"Arrested for burning down his school's gym at age 12.  Spent time in detention, set his roommate's bunk on fire. \" Got sent to a psychiatric facility in 2006.  Just released a month ago.  That explains why the fires only just started now.  Gonna turn that over to Deb? Call it in on the tip line? I'm not sure I can.  Deb was right.  Now that I have proof, my urges are beyond my control.  Your Dark Passenger.  Where did you come up with that, anyway?   Thought I got it from you.    I gave you the code.  The Dark Passenger was all yours.  You said it got into me too early in that shipping container.    You thought I was possessed.    I meant you were traumatised.  Not possessed.  The first time you said it, you must've been about 12.  I just let it go.  I couldn't let you blame yourself for feelings that were too complicated for a young boy to understand.  But you're not a boy anymore.  Oh, you sound like Hannah.  Maybe she's right.  Maybe the Dark Passenger is just a feeling.    It can't be.    Why? Because if there's no Dark Passenger, then I'm responsible for everything I've done.  It sure is simpler to just pin all the blame on something else, isn't it, Dexter? It's much scarier to think that the Dark Passenger is no more real than I am.    This is where the cabin used to be.    Yeah before it got blown to smithereens.  Juan Alonso? I'm Captain Maria LaGuerta from Miami Metro Homicide.    This is Thomas Matthews.    What do you want'? Were you the owner of this property back in 2007? And did you rent it, at that time, to a James Doakes? Bay Harbor Butcher.  No, no, no.  I told the cops back then I had nothing to do with that.  Then how did Mr.  Doakes come to be staying here? I was renting to Santos Jimenez.    Jimenez?   Some kind of Colombian drug guy.  Not that I knew it.  I'd never rent to a criminal.  Of course not.  Now, why does that sound so familiar? Now I know why the name Santos Jimenez rang a bell.  He wasn't just a drug runner.  One of the men responsible for killing Dexter Morgan's mother, Laura Moser.    Moser?   Yeah.  Some drug lord put a hit out on her because he found out that she was Harry Morgan's Cl.  She was butchered by Jimenez with a chain saw in front of Dexter and his brother, Brian.  Brian Moser? The Ice Truck Killer, that was Dexter's brother? Yeah.  So that means that Dexter watched his mother get chopped up just like the Bay Harbor Butcher chopped up his victims? So, what are you saying?   Where's Jimenez now?   He disappeared.  Murdered by the Bay Harbor Butcher? Who was more likely to want Jimenez dead, Doakes or Dexter?   Oh, come on, Maria.    No, Tom.  We can't ignore the facts.  The Bay Harbor Butcher took blood slides from his victims.  Dexter is a blood spatter analyst.  And Doakes always thought there was something off about Dexter.  What if Doakes was on to him? Jesus.  What if Dexter is the real Bay Harbor Butcher? What if he isn't?   I am gonna go question him.    No, you're not gonna do that.    Now, I don't think you're right.    Trust me, I hope I'm not.  If somebody's gotta talk to Dexter, it's gonna be me.  I've known him since he was a kid.  He trusts me.  What's more, I'm a lot less likely to fuck it up.  The only thing between me and killing the Phantom is a slightly deflated water wing.  You sure we can't talk you into coming for a swim? I'd love to, but I got something I gotta take care of.  Put your hand through there.  Do this one too.  There you go.    Well, well, who's this big fella?   That's my son, Harrison.  Harrison.  Isn't that fancy? And who are you? I'm Jamie, Harrison's nanny.  Boy.  They didn't have nannies like you back in my day.  We're gonna go swimming now.  You ready? Ready, little man? Yeah.  Boy, the way they coddle kids today.  They're all gonna be expecting a helping hand.  The world isn't like that.  It's sink or swim, sonny boy.  Have fun.  What do you want'? Well, Dexter, I can tell that you care about my daughter.    I'm here to find out how much.    Get to the point.  I have information that could be very damaging to Hannah.  Now, I could give this information to the police or you could pay me a nice, tidy sum to keep it.  What are you talking about? When Hannah got out of juvie, she killed a counsellor at a halfway house.  She fed him rat poison.  Her roommate, little gal named Arlene Schram saw her do it with her own two eyes.  The cops could get her to spill her guts.  You're lying.  I read Sal Price's book on Hannah.  He mentioned the counsellor, nothing about the roommate.    I hadn't told him about it yet.    What? Where do you think he was getting all those juicy, little plums? Price was paying me to dish dirt on my daughter.  I was saving the good stuff for a bigger payday.  Then the son of a bitch went belly up.  Andthere went my meal ticket.  You'd sell your own daughter out for a crawfish farm? Fuck crawfish, man.  I'm up to my ears in gambling debt.  But you do what you gotta do.  So you gonna give me my money or do I send Hannah to jail? Get out of here before you see my bad side.  You might wanna ask Hannah about Arlene before you come to a final decision.  Then we'll talk numbers.  What exactly were you doing here? It was a personal matter.  My girlfriend works at the club.  Jesus, Quinn.  I came to talk to Novikov about Nadia.  The conversation got heated.  He pulled out a gun, shot me.  I returned fire.  Self defence.    Plain and simple.    Write up a report.  I want it on my desk in the morning.  There's a little problem with your story.  There's a time lag between the first shot and the second.  I want the truth.  I told you the truth.  I went down when George shot me.  He started to beat the shit out of Nadia.  I reached for my gun.  He wheeled around, ready to blow my head off and I took him out.  That's what happened.    Okay.  Then we'll go with that.    Minus Nadia.  Yeah.    Hey, where's Dexter?   I don't know.  But I'd like to point out that I am here, doing my duty.    What?   Nothing.  I feel like I'm gonna be sick.  How can that be my own father? I'm sorry to have to tell you this but I needed to know that he was telling the truth.  Arlene Schram is the only person who can put me in jail.  She saw me put poison in that counsellor's food.    I'm gonna have to pay him.    That's not gonna solve anything.  I don't see any other option.  When other people have threatened you, you've found other options.  I can't.  He's my father.  I'm gonna call my bank.  I know what you're thinking.  I'm not thinking anything.  Clint McKay doesn't meet the code.  But Joseph Jensen does.  It's not as much fun when you're not wearing your suit, is it? Who are you? I can't see you.  Maybe I'm a phantom.  Then again, maybe not.  A phantom can't hurt you.  Oh, God.  Please don't.    Who's Bobby?   Let me go.  Stop whining.  Who's Bobby? Bobby Hamilton, my best friend when I was 12.  That's when you set your first fire.  I didn't set it.  Bobby did.  It was all his idea.  But then he died and I got caught.  Sent me to the nuthouse like I was crazy.  It's all because of Bobby.  Fucking asshole.  So does he still talk to you? Is Bobby the one telling you to set these fires? No, that would make me crazy and I'm not fucking crazy.  I only hurt people because of Bobby.  No, you're the one who's setting those fires.  The one who's burning people alive.  You can't blame it on something that happened when you were a kid.  You're not a kid anymore.  It's time for you to take responsibility.  Fuck.  The caller said they smelled kerosene.  Looks like we have the right place.  Holy shit.  It's Joe Jensen.  I interviewed this guy.  Dumb fuck must've passed out from the fumes.  He's still alive.  I guess we found our Phantom.  Who'd have thought it'd be so easy?   Yeah.    Guys, come on down.  Got your call.  Glad you came to your senses.  You got my money? Yeah.  It's right back here.  What's with all the plastic? You'll find out soon.  What the hell? This isn't the way to make a good impression on your girlfriend's father.  But I can't allow you to hurt Hannah.  Oh, please.  I won't talk to the cops.  I'll leave town.  I promise, I'll never come near Hannah again.  I wish I could believe you.  Actually, I don't because then I couldn't kill you.    Oh, please, you don't have to do this.    That's what I'm realising.  I don't have to.  But I want to.  Even though you don't meet my code, I really   I really want to.  Because unlike you, I care about Hannah.  You got the devil inside you, boy.  No, I think it's just me.  Sink or swim, Daddy.    Hey, Deb.    We arrested the Phantom thanks to you.  Now I know why you weren't at The Fox Hole.    Consider it a gift.  Bullshit.  You want something in return.  I'm guessing it's for me to lay off your girlfriend.    Well, now that you mention it.    Forget it.  I always give in to you.  But not anymore.  I understand.  I got the money for my dad.  I left him a message.  He should be here soon.  He won't be coming.  How do you know? I had a talk with him.  I made it clear that I wouldn't allow him to hurt you anymore.  And I think he understood.  So he's gone? He won't be bothering you again.  Thank you.  The Dark Passenger has been with me ever since I can remember pulling the strings, running the show.  But as it turns out, I'm no puppet.  And you should know, you were right.  About what? The Dark Rider.  He doesn't exist.  Turns out maybe you understand me a little better than I understand myself.  I love you.  I think I love you too.  Hey.  I need your help.  We need to find a woman named Arlene Schram.  Sure.  Who's that? According to a message I got last night from Hannah McKay's father she's a witness to a murder.      Previous EpisodeNext Episode"

        "script": "Previously on Dexter Our primary suspect is Sergeant James Doakes.    Doakes?   If Doakes really wasn't the Bay Harbour Butcher, best thing to do is look into Doakes' final days.  We should start with the cabin in the Everglades where Doakes died.    I was renting the place to Jimenez.    Jimenez? He was one of the three men responsible for killing Dexter Morgan's mother.  What if Dexter is the real Bay Harbour Butcher? If somebody's gonna talk to Dexter, it's gonna be me.  All right, tell your boyfriend who you belong to.    I'm sorry.    It's okay.  Go.  Go, now.  He died in my apartment.  Figured it would kick in while Price was on the road.  An auto accident.    How'd you do it?   Price liked to chew on his pens.  Last one had a little something on it.  She is a killer.  You will never be safe with her.  When Hannah got out of juvie she killed a counsellor at a halfway house.  She fed him rat poison.  Her roommate, a little gal named Arlene Schram, saw her do it.  He won't be bothering you again.  I love you.  I think I love you too.  I need to find Arlene Schram.  Sure.  Who's that? According to a message I got last night from Hannah McKay's father she's a witness to a murder.  I've never thought about the future.  About growing old.  Maybe because the future has never been kind to people like me.  Or their loved ones.  Bye, Dad.  Bye, Harrison.  But, suddenly, my future seems very possible.  And growing old is not only a possibility it seems appealing.    Hello.    Am I speaking with Dexter Morgan?   Yeah, that's right.    This is Department of Corrections.  Hector Estrada is having a parole hearing.    What? When?   This morning at 10 a. m.  I know this is sudden.  Okay.  Thank you for letting me know.  You're welcome, sir.  That was the Department of Corrections.  Hector Estrada is up for parole.  He thinks there's good chance he'll get it.  Estrada? Remember I told you about my mother and how she died? Oh, God.  Was he   ? Was he one of the men that killed her? He was the leader.  He gave the order.  What about the others? Dead.  Estrada is the last survivor.  I'm sure you'll have something to say about that.  Look at it this way.  Maybe it's the universe giving you a Christmas present.  No one but you would see it that way.  Maybe killing Estrada will close this chapter of my life and open me up to a future with Hannah.  Panel has reviewed all the pertinent data in this matter.  We find that the prisoner meets the requirements for parole under the Compassionate Release Statute 463.  Have you read the statute? You understand your obligations? I understand what's expected of me.  I won't screw up.  At this time, we invite any victims present to enter a statement either for or against the board's decision.  I have no objection.  Nadia, it's me again.  This is my fifth message.  Just wanna know where you are.  Give me a call.  Did you get a bad news? Just trying to find Nadia.  Hey.  Taking a survey.  Secret Santa this year or no Secret Santa? I got enough presents to buy, man.  Man, the Christmas spirit around here sucks big reindeer dicks.  Deb.  I found Arlene Schram.  Oh, fucking amazing.  She's living out in Hialeah.  Two drug arrests since juvie, has two kids from different fathers.  Temporarily lost custody a year ago due to her drug abuse.  Good to know.  I'll have to go hard.  I might have to take away   her Mother of the Year trophy.    Any luck in locating Hannah's father? No, zero.  He dropped the dime on his daughter and then skipped town.  Well, he's a drifter.  He could be anywhere.  Maybe we should let your brother know what we're doing.    We're investigating his girlfriend.    I told Dexter that if I found anything on Hannah, I'd act.    I still don't feel right about this.    And I'm telling you it's my call, okay? Matthews made his choices.  Now he spends Christmas alone with his boat.  How close was I to the same fate? Oh, hand me one of those zip ties on the table there, will you? Thanks.  Fucking Christmas lights.  Every year I put them up, and every year I wonder why I bothered.  You said you wanted to see me.  Yeah.  Yeah, thanks for coming out.  Sit.  I wanted to give you a heads up on this idea that Captain LaGuerta has got.  What? The Bay Harbour Butcher.  Maria's convinced that Doakes was innocent and that the real killer is still at large.  Actually, she thinks it might be you.  Me? I know.  Personally, I think she's had one too many Mosquitos or whatever they call that goddamn drink.  But, anyway, here we are.  What makes her think I'm the Bay Harbour Butcher? She knows your life story, your childhood what you saw in that cargo container.  Most people, that would screw them up for life.  Your brother went through the same thing, look what happened to him.  He saw your mother dismembered before his eyes then he went on to dismember his own victims.  Drink? No.  The Bay Harbour Butcher also dismembered his victims.  Of course, your brother wasn't the Butcher.  The murders continued after his death.  But it's weird, huh? Another thing that's weird, that cabin where Doakes died.  What about it? Was rented to a man named Jimenez.  He's one of the men who killed your mother.  I mean, what are the odds? He's interrogating me.  You knew my father, you've known me my whole life do you think I'm the Bay Harbour Butcher? Of course not.  But if I don't ask these questions, Maria will.  You know, I always had a bad feeling about Doakes.  He obviously didn't like me too much from the get go.  Not exactly a secret.  But then that whole Bay Harbour Butcher case came along and something happened that I've never told anyone about.    What?   I saw Doakes on his boat.  Doakes had a boat? Yeah.  I figured he used it to dispose of his victims.  He kept it at the same marina as mine.  I moved my boat to get away from him.  Why didn't you come forward? Because I didn't know what he'd do to me or my sister.  Yeah.  Doakes was a pretty formidable guy.  Yeah.  I can imagine how scared you must have been.  Sorry to put you through all this, Dexter.  I'll talk to Maria get her to move on.  No hard feelings? None.  I've given them a boat to search for.  Now I just have to make sure there's something for them to find.  Hey, don't splash your sister.  I'm not gonna tell you again.  Sorry, they are non stop.  No, I have a nephew their age, so I can relate.  Traded one vice for another.  At least they can't take your kids away for tobacco.  First Christmas clean and sober, and it won't be the last.  Knock on wood.  Just wanna keep looking forward, you know? That's kind of why I'm here, Arlene, to keep you looking forward.  To keep you out of jail, actually.    Why would I be going to jail?   As an accessory to murder.  He was a counsellor at a halfway house where you resided 10 years ago.  Someone spiked his coffee with rat poison.    I don't have any idea.    I'm not after you.  I'm after Hannah McKay.  She was your roommate at the time.  It was her idea, but you had part in it.  You either helped or you kept quiet.    What do you want'?   I wanna know what happened.  In return, I'll promise immunity from prosecution keep you out of jail, make sure your kids have their mother to put presents under the tree.  I'd like some time to think about this.  Okay, do that.  And play with your kids.  Because depending on what you decide you might not get to do that for a really long time.  Quiet now.  So turn this way now.  Do you remember the first and last time Dad took us to see Santa? You yanked his beard and I asked for a gun.  Where the fuck are you, the North Pole? You haven't said anything.  What is it? You sure you wanna know? Oh, Jesus.  Tell me.  LaGuerta is still looking into the Bay Harbour Butcher.  Shit.  I talked to Matthews.  She's pulled him into the investigation.    What?   It gets worse.  They think it's me.  You weren't gonna fucking tell me? Do they have anything? I don't know.  I need to put them off this once and for all.  How? Give them proof that Doakes was the Butcher.  It will mean planting evidence.  You can't do that, not with those two on your case.  I'll just have to be very careful.  Now, were you a good boy? So, what do you want for Christmas?   Fuck it.  It's too risky for you.  I'll do it.    Deb, no.  I'm not gonna let Harrison grow up without a father.  I just want this to be the end once and for all.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Hey.    Ready? Say \"cheese,\" everyone.    Cheese.  I'm sorry, I don't think Dexter Morgan has anything to do   with the Bay Harbour Butcher.    You're letting your feelings completely cloud your judgment.  You're letting whatever you had with Doakes make you blind to his guilt.  I've heard of people fucking their brains out, but God.    Well, that's low even for you, Tom.    Look, let's just follow up on this boat.  Look, if James had owned a boat, I would have known.  Well, call it a wild guess.  But if he was using it to dump victims into the ocean he would have tried to keep its existence a secret.  I swear, I never told anyone I saw you poison that man.  I don't get how that stanky detective could know about it.  Must have been my dad.  Why would he do that? He needed money and I wouldn't give it to him.  You know my dad.  Yeah, unfortunately.  I can't go to jail, Hannah.  Lose my kids again, I couldn't take it.  I'm not gonna let that happen.  Hey, look at me.  When that counsellor was putting his hands on us and I shut him down for good, you backed me up.  Always stuck together.  That's not gonna change now, is it? But that detective's gonna come back.  She's not gonna let up.  I'm gonna figure something out.  You just have to stay strong, okay? Not this one.  This one looks like Doakes.  Did you have to get the biggest tree? Well, anything smaller than this looks like a Charlie Brown tree.  By the way, you still doing Christmas day with Debra and Harrison? Yeah.  You can join us.  Not sure if Debra and me in the same room would be very Christmassy.  Okay.  Maybe we could start a new tradition.  Christmas Eve this year and next year, the year after that.  I like that, except there is one problem.    What?   I haven't got you a Christmas present.  I don't really need anything.  Suit yourself.  Guess I'm just gonna have to go out and buy you a pair of socks.  Hold up! Hey! Hey! That's not the walk of a dying man.  I guess freedom was the tonic he needed.  But I'll soon change that.    Jenna.    Hey, Quinn.  I'm looking for Nadia.  Know where she is? Hey, pal, find your own.  Sorry, does your wife know you're here? No, so shut the fuck up.  Nadia's in Vegas.    What are you talking about?   She moved there to work.  Got a job in one of the casinos.    When?   Couple days ago.  She left you a note.  It's in my locker.    I probably shouldn't have read it.    What did it say? She's sorry, but she needed a new start.  Staying here was too hard for her.  She was really broken up.  That all? Oh, that you mean a lot to her and she'll never forget what you did for her.  I'll be done in a few minutes and I can go get it.  Thanks.  Last Christmas, I was down in the Keys.  This Christmas, your garage.    No one's forcing you to be here, Tom.    Oh, I'm too afraid to leave you alone.  You might decide I'm the Bay Harbour Butcher and haul me in.    What is it?   Come here.  Take a look.  It's a tackle box.  These are deep sea fishing lures.  Meaning? Meaning they're the kind you need a boat to use.  Jeez, what a mess.  Well, it's been empty for years.  Doakes probably scrapped his boat once we were closing in on him.  We don't know Doakes used this place.  You're jumping to conclusions.  This address came from the tackle box which came from the cabin where Doakes died.  This isn't jumping to a conclusion.  This conclusion's hanging from your ass.    That private forensics team of yours?   Yeah, what about them? Get them out here.  I think we just struck oil.  The blood's too degraded to analyse, but we found one print on the hilt.  It's a match for James Doakes.  You're certain? No question, captain.  Well, that sews it up.  Tom.  This evidence could have been planted.  Dexter is a forensics expert   and he has the skills     Maria, it's over.  The fat lady isn't singing, her song is done.  She's getting humped in her dressing room.  Jesus Christ, Tom.  What is wrong with you? Maria, why can't you let this go? I guess because I feel I owe it to James to clear his name.  Why? Because you two were a couple? Because he was innocent.  You're not an investigator, Maria.  Your talent's in playing the game, and you play a great one.  Hell, you beat me.  But either way I'm done here.  Now, I expect you to live up to your end of the bargain.  Forty year pay scale on my pension.  I remember, Tom.  Don't worry, you'll get what's coming to you.  I expect to.  Feliz Navidad, Mafia.  What the hell are you doing here? Don't tell me we're neighbours.  I'm not here to fight with you or trade insults.  That's a good thing, you probably wouldn't last one round.  I came here to talk to you about Dexter.  Dexter? If you care about him, listen to what I have to say.  Just hear me out, that's all I ask.  I'm all ears.  Dexter is happy. .   and I know him well enough to understand that this is a pretty big deal.  He's been through a lot of trouble and a lot of pain.    I can't deny that.    I think for the first time in really a long time, he's actually looking forward to the future.  He talks about it.  About me and him together.  And I think that Dexter could be a whole lot happier if he knew that you and I could find some common ground.    For Dexter's sake.    Yeah.  He really does seem to like having you around.  I love him.    And I know that you do too.    Yeah, you bet I do.  Can't we work out our issues? I think we can.  It's because I love Dexter that I'm willing to do whatever it takes to protect him from you.  I'm not gonna give up until your murdering ass is behind bars for good.  That's how we're gonna work out our issues.  But, hey thanks for stopping by.  Okay.  Son of a bitch.  You got a dead one.  Yeah.  Well, it's gonna have to stay dead.  There's only so much a man can do.    What brings you around?   Merry Christmas.    I noticed you were on empty.    Thanks.  I was thinking about the last conversation we had.  I owe you an apology.  I should have come forward with my suspicion about Doakes.    More people would be alive.    If anyone should apologise, it's me.  I was stupid.  I should never have entertained Maria's theory about you being the Butcher.    You think she'll ever accept the truth?   She already has.    We found Doakes' boathouse.    Really? What's even more amazing is what we found hidden inside it.  I won't go into details, except to say it leaves no doubt as to Doakes' guilt.  Believe me, you won't have to worry about LaGuerta anymore.  Well, I gotta say, that's about the best Christmas present I could've imagined.  You and me both.  Have a good Christmas with your boy.  We Will.  Christmas just got a lot less merry for Hector Estrada.  My late lamented Dark Passenger would be very pleased.  If I can break this last strand from my past do I get the future I want?   Yeah.    I went to see Matthews again.  They're calling off the investigation.  You sure? Yeah.  They bought it.  Everything.  Well, let's hope they stay bought.  Thanks, Deb.    You're Hector Estrada?   I know you? You do now.  Steve Gaskill.  Come on, man.  You're a legend.  You're gonna be a stain if you don't crawl to where you came from.  I know I'm way out of line.  I gotta tell you about my situation.  I have this contact in Honduras, an old Army buddy.  He sends me a crate of sativa every other month.  I've been trying to lay it off.  You know, college campuses and whatnot.  But it keeps piling up.  It's too much for me to move.    How much are we talking about?   Enough to make you shit your pants.  I've been trying to find a way into the Hispanic market.    Here you are.  It's Kismet.    Kiss who? It's good luck for both of us.  I can show you the stuff.  If you're interested, maybe we can work something out.  Let me hear you say you're not a cop.  I'm not a cop, man.  Jeez, we know a lot of the same people.  Tuerto, Pepe Chap.    I've sold plenty of shit to them.    Fuck.  Long time since I've dealt with those guys.    Where and when?   Thirty five Quayside Road.  Tonight.  Ten o'clock.  Unless you got something else to do on Christmas Eve.  I'll see you then.    Yep.    Dex, it's Angel.  Debra's at St.  Joseph's.  She's been in a car accident.  I'll meet you at the hospital.  Did you fill out all the questions?   Dex.    How is she? She's fine.  Her wrist is broken, lots of bruising, but she'll be out by tomorrow.  What happened? Apparently, she blacked out or something behind the wheel.  Does Debra have a prescription for anti anxiety medication? Not that there's a problem.  Most people do.  Yeah, she does.  Why? Doctor said there was a lot of that in her system.  Almost three times the normal dose.  Maybe she lost track on how much she took.  You know, it happens.  Well, why is she here in Hialeah? Where was she going? Debra drove here for an interview.  A second interview with a woman, Arlene Schram.  Now, look, Dex, maybe I should've told you this before now but Deb got a tip that this woman, Arlene Schram, was a possible witness to a murder.  A murder committed by Hannah McKay.  You should've told me.  Debra has a bug up her ass with this girl.  Maybe that's why she took all those anti anxiety pills.  Because she's convinced that her brother is dating a killer.  I don't know what happened.  I was tired.  I was driving.  I kept getting sleepier.  And, I don't know, I must have closed my eyes for a second.    But the next thing I knew, I was     Hanging upside down in a ditch.  Hanging by my seat belt.  This is the most fucked est Christmas ever.  And you were gonna spend it with Arlene Schram.  Hannah told you? Hannah knew? She was at my house yesterday asking me to back off.  Arlene must've called after I left her house.  Hannah was at your house yesterday? Yes.  And now I'm here.    Fucking hell, Dexter.  It's like     She didn't poison you.  Well, I sure as shit didn't swallow a handful of pills.  The doctor said that it's possible the drugs built up in your system.  I took one.  One.  Last night.  That drug has a short half life.  Gotta hand it to her.  That's a really good plan.  Making it look I accidentally took too much of a prescription that I have? It's not a hard drug to get.    How would she know you were on it?   You must have mentioned it.  I never did.  No.  That's the thing about people that poison people.  They're really fucking sneaky.  So she what, poisoned you while she was at your house last night? I didn't let her inside my house last night.    Deb     I went for a run.  Maybe she broke in after I left or something.  She broke into your house and did what?   I don't know how she did it.    Because she didn't.  Fuck, this is what happened to Sal Price.  He got close to knowing the truth about Hannah, she killed him.  There's no proof she killed Sal Price and no proof that she poisoned you.  Well, maybe we need to find the proof.  There's another explanation for what happened.  You took more of those pills than you think you did.  You've been under a lot of stress, Deb.  No shit, Sherlock.  So you took one and you lost track.  You took another.  And another.  It's possible.  It happens.  You have to admit that, right? Deb's more right than she knows about what happened to Sal Price.  But Hannah wouldn't do that to Debra.  Would she? I make my living at crime scenes, proving what happened.  But now can I prove what didn't happen? Prove that Hannah didn't poison Debra? Is this proof that Hannah was here? Did she break in? Or did she simply walk through an open door? Or did this fall off me? Did I track this in just now? The drug works quickly.  Deb would've passed out minutes after ingesting it.  Sorry for your loss.    No, my sister's doing fine.    Yeah.  Can't say the same thing for this poor baby.  You'll have to go in through the passenger side.  I'll see what the lab has to say about what's in this bottle.  Hannah didn't poison Debra.  All I want for Christmas is for that to be true.  Merry Christmas Eve.  We're having a Nochebuena at the restaurant later.  Auri will be there.  You should come by.  Thank you, but I'm not up for it.  Holidays, family, cheer.  They're keeping Debra overnight at the hospital.  You should know that.  I know.  You wanna tell me the real reason you're here? I've been thinking about what's next for me.  Yeah? I'm enjoying the restaurant, even with all the headaches.  It's real.  Straightforward.  You open up, you feed people you clean up, you close up, then you go home.  That's it.  That's your day.  You don't carry it with you.    Not like this job?   No.  And up until, I don't know Mike's death maybe it never got to me.  It's time, isn't it? You ever think about what's next? Sometimes.  I've been looking back a little too.  You know, wondering about some choices I've made wishing I'd made different ones.  Are you talking about me? Are you talking about you, about us? Are you wishing that it would've worked out? No.  No.  Okay, just checking.  So when are you retiring? Thought about putting papers in on the first.  Happy New Year.  Let's hope.  Dexter, hey.  I was worried about you.    Look who's here.    Daddy's home.  Come here, bud.  Oh, yeah.    Thanks for staying over tonight.    My pleasure.  Ever since I've gone vegetarian, watching my brother roast a whole pig grosses me out.  Besides, you guys are family too.  Yeah, and so are you.  How's Debra? Yeah, how's she doing? She's fine.  She should be out tomorrow.  Oh, I'm glad to hear that.  Well, I hope you're hungry, Dexter.  Look at her.  So beautiful.  But can you ever fully trust a poisoner? Okay, Dexter? Dexter.  Earth to Dexter.  I think your food coma's hitting way early.    You're right.    What do you want'? A little bit of everything.  Christmas is a time of expectation.  If you're good, a red suited fat man will break into your house and leave presents.  But Santa Claus doesn't exist.  The most wonderful time of the year celebrates a lie.  ls the future I imagine with Hannah nothing more than a vision dancing in my head? It's funny how we started off in Santa's Holiday Adventure and here we are, Christmas Eve together.  A place I never thought I'd be with anyone again much less you.  Thanks.  I'm not saying this quite right.  All the men that I've been with there was a lot of running away.  But when I'm with you I don't wanna go anywhere.  Stay with me tonight.  No, I can't.  I have somewhere to be.  Debra? Estrada? Good for you.  He's somebody you've wanted for a long time.  Someone I thought I'd never get.  I imagine that will be deeply satisfying.  When Deb had her accident she was heading to Arlene Schram's house.  She was hoping Arlene would give her a statement that would let her arrest you.  But Deb never made it there.  She blacked out behind the wheel.    Does that sound familiar?   Familiar? Sal Price.  It's what you hoped would happen to him before you poisoned him.  Are you? Do you think that I had something to do with Debra's accident? Did you? Oh, I can't believe you would even think something like that.  Say something.  You will do whatever it takes to protect yourself.  That does not include trying to poison your sister.  You yourself told me Arlene saw you poison that counsellor's coffee.  And I can't tell you how many times I saw Arlene shoot up.  I was nervous about what she could do, but then I went to see her and she's a mess that any law student could discredit.  She's not a threat to me.  But Deb is.  Do you think I would be that stupid to try and poison the lieutenant of Homicide? And to think that you wouldn't figure it out? Wouldn't exactly bring us closer together, would it? You know I love you, right? Yes.  Do you love me? Yes.  I don't know if I believe you.  You were at her house last night.  I thought if she knew how much I cared then she would back down a little.  But she never will.  What happens next week when Deb has a heart attack? Do you hear yourself? If anything happens, I'll wonder if you had something to do with it.  Well, that's your problem, your lack of trust.  Your inability to trust.  God, it's like It's like you have something deep inside of you that you think is undeserving of love.    Don't turn this back on me.    You're accusing me.  I ju   I know what you're capable of.  Okay, I'm not sure quite how to say this but I've never made a mistake.  If I had poisoned Debra, then she would be dead.  If you know me the way that you say that you do then you know that that's true.  Maybe it all was just an accident.  It must have been really scary to see her in the hospital like that.  It was.  It's understandable you would try to make sense of a situation that doesn't make sense but you're doing that at the expense of this relationship.  I'm not trying to.  I I don't wanna lose you.  I'm sure about you.  I'm 100 percent sure but you need to be able to say the same thing about me.  I know.  We could have it all.  I think you need to figure out what it is that you want and what type of future you wanna have.  It's right in here.  What the fuck is this, huh? Where's the stuff? Fuck.  Estrada.  Estrada.  Estrada, it's time.  The Department of Corrections kept that for you.  That was very thoughtful.  You've changed a lot in the past 40 years.  So have I.  Three men murdered my mother.  Juan Pablo Aliso, shot in another deal.  Santos Jimenez.  You remember him.  He testified against you.  I cut him into six roughly equal pieces with a chain saw.  Just like he did my mother.  Like I'm gonna do to you.  Holy fuck, you're Dickie Moser.  Dexter Moser.  I am Dexter Moser.  And I'm gonna kill you.  Is that what all this is about? I was 3 years old when you left me in that container.  Who am I gonna be when you're dead? Still some fucking freak, probably.  We'll see.  You're working with her, aren't you? What? That fucking cop bitch, the one who got me out.  Oh, yeah, they said that there was a big push for my release from the captain of Miami Metro.  LaGuerta? She fucking set me up.  You're not the one who was set up.  Officer.  We followed him here, but we lost him.  Till we heard the gunshot.  That's when we called you.    All right.  Anything else since?   No.  Show me where.  What is going on in this place? Keep looking for Estrada and anyone else with him.  Estrada's not alone.  Don't make a fucking sound.  Around the other side.  It wasn't the universe giving me a gift.  It was LaGuerta.  I can make sure one member of the Morgan family has a good Christmas.  Yes.  It's Sergio.  You told me to call you when I ran that water you brought in.  What'd you find? That water's like That's an anti anxiety drug.  Someone must have wanted to knock themselves out.  But this time of year, who can blame them?   Thanks.    You got it.  It was no accident.  Hannah dissolved the pills into Deb's water so that she'd pass out behind the wheel.  A problem in Hannah's life solved.  Hannah poisoned Debra.  It's not the future I had wanted with Hannah but maybe it's what I deserve.  You barely said two words on the ride home.  I have something for you.  A present? A new car, I hope.  I guess it's a present.  It's Sal Price's pen.  If you test it, you'll find traces of aconite on the end and Hannah's prints.  So that's how she did it.  I found it the next morning.  I kept it out of evidence.  I can't believe you're gonna turn her in.  As long as she's free, you're not safe.  Dex, I know how hard this must be for you.  You're here.  Does that mean that you know what you want? Yes.    Hannah   You have to kiss me or it's bad luck.  What's the matter? I'm sorry.  Sorry? Hannah McKay, you're under arrest for the murder of Sal Price.  You should have killed me.  I should know better than to count on the future.  All you can ever believe in is now this moment.  Because in a blink everything can change.      Previous EpisodeNext Episode"

        "script": "Previously on Dexter: Dexter, what the fuck? Maybe we should just get rid of the body.  We make it look like a suicide.  How do we do that? Gasoline.  There's a station nearby.  I'll go get a couple of gallons.  If Doakes really wasn't the Bay Harbor Butcher best thing is look into his final days.  We should start with the cabin in the Everglades where Doakes died.  Maria's convinced that Doakes was innocent   that the real killer might be you.    Me? Do what you gotta do.  That was Department of Corrections.  Hector Estrada is up for parole.    Estrada?   I told you about my mother and how she died? Was he one of the men that killed her? He was the leader.  He gave the order.  It's the universe giving you a Christmas present.  No one but you would see it that way.  Estrada! You're working with her, aren't you? That fucking cop bitch, the one that got me out.    LaGuerta.    She fucking set me up.  You're not the one who was set up.  Debra's at St.  Joseph's.  She's been in a car accident.  Well, I sure as shit didn't swallow a handful of pills.  She poisoned you while she was at your house last night? Find the proof.  Hannah dissolved the pills into Deb's water so that she'd pass out behind the wheel.  Sal Price's pen.  If you test it, you'll find traces of aconite on the end.    Can't believe you're gonna turn her in.    As long as she's free, you're not safe.  You should have killed me.  You look like you got some sun.  The boat.  They treating you well? I get 10 minutes outside.  My cellmate seems nice.  She robbed a liquor store so she could buy meth.    You have every     You said you loved me.    I do.    Then why am I here? You poisoned Debra.  Because she was trying to keep us apart.  And what was I supposed to do? I don't know.  I don't know, you could have just broken up with me.  And completely free you up to kill Deb? No.  I'm gonna spend the rest of my life behind bars.    You left me no choice.    You had a choice.  You were supposed to choose me.  She's my sister.  Jesus.  I never stood a chance.  Don't.  Why are you even here? I had to see you.  If you're worried I'm gonna tell people what you are, then don't worry.  Your secret is safe with me.  Is it? I would never do that to you.  I came here because I wanted   I needed you to know.  If there was another   Any way to keep Deb safe I would have found it.  I miss you so much.  I miss you too.  You're the only person in the world I don't have to hide anything from.  I don't know what I'm gonna do without you.  Dexter, it's not too late.  The only thing they have on me is that fucking pen.  If the pen disappears, so can we.  We can go some place that your sister can't find us.  We can go to Argentina and be together always.  I can never trust you.    But you just     And you know you can never trust me.  We both knew it would come to this, one of us dead or behind bars.  Yeah.  Except I always thought it would be you.  Sorry.  Yeah, me too.  Goodbye, Dexter.  I tried to kill Hannah but couldn't.  I wanna hate her for what she did to Deb but can't.    Hello.    An inmate from the Sheriff's Department is trying to contact you via collect call.  Do you accept the charges?   Yeah.    Connecting.  Arlene, thank God.    Hannah, what's wrong?   I can't do this.  I can't spend my life in here.  I need you to help me.  I need this to be over.  No, you're stronger than that.  You haven't even had your trial.  I can visit you.  Arlene, you owe me.  I took care of that counsellor for the both of us and now I need your help, okay? I can't live like this.  Tell me what to do.  I don't know who's worse, you or him.  It is Toy mageddon every time I walk in here.  He can't make up his mind which one he likes the best.  He's a boy.  He wants them all.  I can clean this stuff up.  Go, get ready for work.  I got it.    All right, Harrison.    Hey.  We're gonna need to let Jamie pick some things up.  That doesn't mean you can't play with Thomas.  I want Hannah.  Sweetie, Hannah had to go away, but that doesn't mean that she doesn't miss you very, very much.  Okay? Okay.    Let's see if we can get Thomas to talk.    One   Captain?   Dexter.  What are you doing here? It might be best if you take Harrison to another room.  Because? Because I'm placing you under arrest for the murder of Hector Estrada.  Dexter?   This has to be some sort of mistake.    I wish it was.    Who is Hector Estrada?   Stay back.    Get your hands off.    Stay back.  Jamie, just take Harrison to his room.  It's okay.  I'm calling Deb.  Dexter Morgan \"you have the right to remain silent.  Anything you say or do can be used against you in a court of law.  You have the right to an attorney.  If you cannot afford an attorney, one will be provided for you. \"   What the hell's going on?   Jesus.  LaGuerta arrested Morgan.  I'll call you later.  What are you doing?   Out of my way, Angel.    Why is Dexter in handcuffs? I have proof he's the Bay Harbor Butcher.  Doakes is the Bay Harbor Butcher.  Have you lost your mind?   What is this?   I don't know.  What the fuck? She thinks your brother's the Bay Harbor Butcher.  How is that possible? It's not.  Take those things off his wrists.    Leave those.    Maria, what are you doing? Stand down, lieutenant.  Dexter's my prisoner, you're family.  You need to recuse yourself.  Let's go.    Angel.    I'm on it.  Just so we're clear then your official statement is that you went fishing last night then went home to be with your son.  I didn't kill Hector Estrada.  No? You didn't cut his body into pieces and put it into bags, take it on your boat   then throw it into the ocean?   Why would I do that? Because Hector Estrada butchered your mother in front of you.  So how about you start telling me the truth? I'm not the Bay Harbor Butcher.  He's answered your questions.  You've got nothing.  Not all my questions.  These are from my phone last night and that's you carrying plastic garbage bags onto your boat.  It was ice to keep any fish I caught cold.  My cooler broke.  But earlier today, you said you didn't catch anything.  What was in the bag? It was a shirt with Hector Estrada's blood on it and his wallet.  You killed him.  You killed him like you killed all your other victims.  Admit it.  You're the Bay Harbor Butcher.    Dexter, don't say another word.    That's enough, sergeant.  I was throwing away my dinner.  It was a bag from Franco's.  You can check.    Angel, you gotta believe me.    You framed Doakes.  After I defended you against him.  You betrayed me, this department, everybody around you.  Is that what this is about? Your desperate need to believe the James Doakes you knew or thought you knew, wasn't a cold blooded killer? You don't have the right to speak his name.  You're so hurt angry, scared.  He's dead because of you.  You were his partner, his lieutenant his lover.  If you couldn't see what was in front of your eyes what does that say about you? I swear to God, Dexter I'm gonna nail you to the wall for what you've done.    Maria.    To the wall! Maria, that's enough.  Goddamn it, lieutenant.  You can't be in here.    Tell them what you told me.    I reran the blood on the shirt Captain LaGuerta discovered in the trash.  It's definitely Hector Estrada's, but after going over it I found an evidence number.  What? What evidence number? Shirt with Estrada's blood on it is the shirt he was wearing the day he was brought in, back in '73.  Things got a little rough and the arresting officers broke his nose.  That's impossible.  I checked inventory.  The shirt's missing.  What about his wallet? Don't kill the messenger.  There was a partial print and it's yours.    Were you trying to frame my brother?   Deb.  You son of a bitch.    You set me up.    Maria.    Can I go now?   Yes, you can.  He did this.  He's the Bay Harbor Butcher.  He has to be.  This witch hunt of yours is over.  If you have a problem with it we can take it upstairs.  Captain.  Everyone else may have bought your little victim routine in there but we both know the truth.  And the truth is it's been a very long day.  You set me up, just like you did James.  Now, I'm sure you've already managed to kill Estrada.  Leaves me no chance to prove any of this.  Congratulations.  You've won again.  I just wanna go home and see my son.  James always knew there was something wrong with you.  Surprise, motherfucker.  You got my reports? Hot off the presses.  Headlines.  Twenty six stab wounds, the first pierced her heart.    Whoever did this     Was making a point.  This is our third vic.  Any Suspects? Walter Munro.  Crazy.  Thinks he's some philosopher or some shit.  Scribbling his fucked up thoughts in his journals.  Victims are all prostitutes.  Wounds suggest the same weapon.  Consistent with a single killer.  The thing is he's crazy, but he's smart too.  I can never get anything on him.  Hold up.  What's up? What we talked about.  Come on, Maria.  Don't you at least wanna think about it? I'm sorry, James.  Oh, shit, Morgan.  I didn't even know you were there.  You're, like, invisible.  If only I had stayed invisible.    Maria, wait up.    Angel.    Hey.    I don't wanna hear it.  I just checked with Estrada's parole officer.  You were behind his release from prison? Somehow Dexter figured out I was watching him.  Everyone thinks that you're trying to frame Dexter.    I am     Dexter.  I don't care what everybody else thinks.  Well, you better start caring.  Do you wanna keep your job?   I wanna keep my job.    Then better back off   and drop this whole crazy idea.    Angel, I need you to be on my side.  I am on your side and that's why I'm telling you this.  But you have to stop.    It looks pretty bad, doesn't it?   More than pretty bad.  And you're gonna have to work really hard to fix this.  But come on, Maria.  If anyone can work their way out of a jam like this it's you.  Okay.  Thanks for your advice, Angel.  We need to talk.  Harrison just went to sleep.  I'm glad one of us will sleep tonight.  Heads up next time you're gonna get arrested or make our captain look like a lunatic.  It worked, didn't it? Everyone thinks LaGuerta framed me.  She won't be able to come after me anymore.  All it cost her was her career.  How many careers has LaGuerta destroyed? That still doesn't make it right.  Not that I even know what that is anymore.  I wish it hadn't come to this, but it was either her or me.  She almost caught me trying to kill Estrada on the docks.  Whose fault was that? LaGuerta's the one who set me up.  So you repay the favour? Would you prefer my normal method of conflict resolution? Not fucking funny.  There was a problem, and I solved it the best way I knew how.  And it's over.  That's what you keep saying.  What about Hannah? What about her? Well, I assume she knows what you are.    Yeah, but     Her arraignment's tomorrow.  How do you know she won't use that to get a better deal?   She won't.    How do you know that? Because she's in love with me.  I pray to fuck you're right.  Take tomorrow off, all right? At least until the dust settles with this LaGuerta thing.  You know this isn't over.  Despite what LaGuerta thinks, Estrada's still out there.  I know.  It's been six days since I let him go and I haven't found him yet.  If he resurfaces, LaGuerta gets wind of it   She'll offer him a deal.  Put him up in some safe house.  You're left to explain to the DA why you came after him with a chainsaw.  I'll find him.  I'll do What I have to do.  You sound like Hannah.  According to Estrada's parole officer this is the last known address of his wife.  Hector has nowhere else to turn.  He's wanted by the police, me.  Mrs.  Estrada? I'm Arthur Curry, Hector's parole officer.  Why are you here? I haven't seen Hector in years.  Hey, honey, who's that? The neighbour.  Please.  Don't come here again.  My Tony doesn't like it.  Well, if you haven't seen Hector, why are you still married to him? I'm Catholic.  Is it that guy again?   You sure he hasn't been around?   You should go.  It's been 40 years, but Florencia hasn't let go of Hector.  Sometimes it only takes a moment to reveal who we really are.  Looks like you spun a goddamn web.  Yeah, it's more like a puzzle.  Connect the dots.  Can you pin this on Munro or not? Entry wounds on the victim are consistent with wounds on previous victims.  She was standing when attacked.    Get another one.    She stumbled, her body turning.  The killer's behind her now, stabbing her in the back repeatedly.  Then she's down on all fours, crawling away until the killer grabs her and flips her over.  He's on top of her now.  He slices her carotid artery.  She's terrified, heart's racing.  It's releasing more blood in thick arterial spurts here and here and Here.  I've never seen someone so excited about a crime scene before.  You like this blood shit too much.  I'm just doing my job.  Wipe that smile off your face and help me find the creep who did this.  I let my guard down.  For an instant, my real life bled into my fake life and Doakes caught his first glimpse of the real me.  Thanks for coming, Tom.  Chrissakes, it's all over the station you tried to frame Dexter.    You know that's not true.    Do I? Commissioner's going to open an investigation into your recent conduct.  If called to testify, I'll be dragged into this and have no choice but tell the truth.  That we found definitive proof that Doakes was the Bay Harbor Butcher.  And that despite me advising you to cease and desist you continued on this reckless course.    So, what's your advice?   Start kissing anything that even remotely resembles an ass.  I'm serious, Tom.  I was hoping for your support.  And make myself look as crazy as you? People still respect you here.  I need someone to have my back, Tom and you could say I had reasonable suspicion.    You carried it too far.    Then say that.  Say that due to my overzealous nature as a police officer I got too caught up in the case.    You got too caught up being an idiot.    I'm already down, Tom.  Stop kicking.  My job is at stake.  Tom? All right.  I'll see what I can do.  Thank you.  You just keep your head low.  And for God's sake, start doing your job if you have any hope of keeping it.  Lieutenant.  What brings you here? I'm the arresting officer.  How's the wrist? Stronger every day.  How's facing life without the possibility of parole? Last time I checked it's innocent until proven guilty.  This is your last chance.  You can save yourself a lot of time and trouble, confess what you've done.  I will if you Will.  My conscience is clear.  All that Xanax.  My, how you must have trouble sleeping at night.  You don't know shit about me.    A minute?   Except you're lieutenant of Homicide and you wear a big shiny badge and yet you know exactly what your brother is.  Don't worry, I'm not gonna tell anyone.  They wouldn't believe me even if I did.  But knowing that you have to live with it is punishment enough.  Still, I'm curious.  How do you justify arresting me and not him? Or is the law just something that you make up as you go along? Turning a blind eye whenever you feel like it or whenever Dexter is involved? Fuck you.  You are a liar and a killer.  But not a hypocrite.  Miss McKay.  Come on, let's go.  You're charged with murder, first degree with the death of Salvador Price.  How do you plead? My client pleads not guilty.  Miss McKay, you are remanded to the state of Florida and bail is denied.  No.  Hannah.    I'm so sorry.    Listen to me.  It's gonna be fine, okay?   Ma'am, you need to step back, please.    Thank you.  Good bye.  Maria.  Just checking in.  It's nice of you.  Seems everyone else is avoiding me.  You know how it is.  Everyone is waiting to see where this lands.  I'm doing everything I can to make sure it doesn't land on my head.  You need to show up to my party.  I really don't think anyone wants to see me there.  Of course they do.  It's also an opportunity for you to apologise to Dexter.    A public act of contrition.    If you straighten it outwith him he can tell the people upstairs that it was just a misunderstanding.  Either way, show up tonight.  It's not just New Year's Eve.  It's also my retirement party.  It wouldn't feel right without you.  I'll be there.  It's the best Jet Ski out there.  Yeah, I just can't see spending Shit! What the fuck? Seward Memorial Hospital, now! She's having some sort of seizure.  She seems stable.  We're wheeling her into Seward Memorial Emergency now.  We'd better contact her next of kin.  Hang on, sweetheart.  Go ahead and get her an MRI.  Make sure it's with contrast.  ETA is Let's hope my hunch is right that the pull of a past romance is enough to compel Florencia to help Estrada.  You wanted to talk? Deb, come in and have a seat.  What's up? You were right.  About? Me.  I let my feelings for Sergeant Doakes affect my decision making.  What I put your brother through was negligent and unforgivable.  And I'm sorry.  If it's any consolation, my career is gonna take a hit.  Suspension, probably worse.  I hope not.  You don't have to say that.  Either way, in the event I'm not around much longer I wanna leave things in some kind of order.  I was trying so hard to prove the Butcher was still active I overlooked some loose ends on Travis Marshall's death.  I was hoping you could help me with the time line.  Sure.  Okay.  According to Dexter's statement previous to the day we found Travis Marshall's body he was doing his final forensics sweep on the church.  Yeah, that's right.    Under your supervision.    No.  I mean, yes, I sent him, but he was on his own.  He doesn't need someone to watch him.  You didn't go to the church?   That day or evening?   No.  You sure? Yes.  Going through the mail, I got a package from Mike Anderson's widow.  And it seems that before Mike died, he ordered security footage from all gas stations around the church.  This got lumped into his personal belongings.  It recently got sent to me, so Can you see that? That's two blocks from the church and there's a time stamp.  It was 22 minutes before the fire department got the call on the burning church.  What were you doing there, lieutenant? What it looks like.  I was getting gas.  Then why lie about it? I didn't lie.  I forgot.  It was a crazy night.  You were certain about it a moment ago.  No   I'm   I am sorry, I Took some food to Dexter at the church.  I was only there for 30 seconds so I didn't think that it was worth remembering.  Then you got some gas.    Yes.    That you put in a gas can? Yeah.  Why in the world   ? Captain, where is this going? That's up to you, lieutenant.  Debra we've known each other a long time.  Is there something you wanna get off your chest? Yes.  I think you have been under a lot of stress.  You know what I think? I think I'm not the only one who made a mistake trying to protect someone they care about.  Is there anything else, captain? Not for now.  But this is just the start of a much larger conversation.  Count on it.  Estrada.  I guess some bonds are unbreakable.  We never leave behind the ones we love.  He could be there all day.  And you can keep that, all right? Hey! Hi, Deb.  Well, now? Okay.  Give me 15 minutes.  Still unconscious, but seizures have stopped.  We've got her stabilised.  We're waiting for a doctor.  We could use your help over here.  Just   Okay.  LaGuerta knew I was lying, Dex.  Wait, wait, let me think.  What? This is bad, Deb.  I don't wanna fucking hear you say that.  You always say that you can fix it.  I Will.  Just don't know how yet.  Dangerous enough when she was focused just on me but now that she's pulled you into this, well, it's worse.  Tell me about it.    I've said this a hundred times.    But you're sorry I got involved in this.  I am.  Are we really that fucked? Look, all she knows is that you bought some gas.  That's not a crime.  Yeah, but buying gas to burn down a church to cover up the fact you killed Travis Marshall is.  She knows that.  But she can't prove it.  Yet.  I need to know what else she has, what her next move is.  If all she's got is that DVD, I can handle this.  Is this ever gonna end? Yeah, it will.  Just go back to work and try and act normal.  Normal? What the fuck is normal? Just do the best you can.  I'll deal with LaGuerta.    What the hell is that?   Estrada.  Oh, shit.  Let's go! Officer Armes calling for backup.  We need units at Seward Memorial.  LaGuerta's house.  What is it you're hoping to find, Dexter? I don't know.  Not this.  Warrants.  With a judge's signature allowing LaGuerta to track the GPS on my phone and Debra's the night the church burnt down.  Once this goes through LaGuerta will have the time line for the night I killed Marshall.  She'll know Debra went to the church, then the gas station.  And then back to the church proving that we both were at the church when it burned down and proving that Deb was my accomplice.  I think it's time to run, Dexter.  But Deb.  I can't leave her behind.  Take her with you.  Debra and Harrison, just go.  You knew one day it would come to this.  Deb could never live like that.  That's always been the plan, Dexter.  That was before.  It's not just Deb.  I don't wanna run either.  Before? Before what? Before everything.  Before I married Rita, before I had a son before Deb knew who I was, before I fell in love.  What difference does that make? Somewhere along the line, the fake life that we created as a cover for me to kill became real.  It's not fake to me anymore.  I don't wanna lose it.  I'm gonna stand my ground.  I don't see any other options here, Dexter.  But I do.  No.  Dexter, you have never done a kill like this.  I'm about to.  No.  LaGuerta's an innocent.  She doesn't even begin to meet the code.  It's the only option.  I can't let Deb go down for what I've done.  My God, Dexter.  How did we end up here? Morning, Dex.  Gonna pick up some steaks and beer tonight, yeah? Sounds good.  The kind of doughnut you choose says a lot about a man.  Hey.  Avoid Doakes.  Bad mood.  First, Lt dumps him, now his prostitute killer seems to have gone missing.    I love these.    Hey.  Thanks.  Get one while they last.  I don't want no fucking doughnut, Morgan.  Sorry.  Hell, it's not you.  It's LaGuerta.  I should have never gotten involved with her to begin with.  Never jump the fence if you're not willing to face what's on the other side.  Where the fuck did you hear that? A friend said it to me in a moment of stress.  Bullshit.  You don't have any friends.  This is the journal of that motherfucking hooker killer Walter Munro.  I took it from his place a couple of weeks ago while serving a warrant.  Locked up in my drawer since.  \"Never jump the fence if you're not willing to face what's on the other side. \" That's a weird coincidence.  Fuck coincidences.  I don't believe in them.    I should     There's something off about you.  I should have seen it before.  The fake smile, the doughnuts.  You don't even walk like a normal person.  You glide.  Like a fucking lizard on ice.  It's all a fucking act and I ain't buying it.  I think you're overreacting.  You're hiding something and one day I'm gonna figure out what it is.  You are one creep motherfucker.  It was a mistake to try to act human in front of Doakes.  All I did was reveal how fake I was.    Captain LaGuerta.    Oye, this is Hector Estrada.  You're alive? I need your help.  I'm back here at the shipyard.  Same container.  That's good.  Very convincing.    You're gonna let me go now, right?   No.    You said     You think I'm a killer and not a liar? Now, this is a kill I've been looking forward to for a long time.  You're the one who started this all, so many years ago.  Should auld acquaintance be forgot?   No, but look.  I can     It's a rhetorical question.  Look! I'm sorry I killed your mother, all right? Was it hard? Making the decision to kill her? Yes.  Yeah, man.  It was the hardest decision of my life.  Look, I didn't wanna do it.  You're lying.  She was a snitch.  It was a matter of survival.  It was her or me.  Come on! This was 40 years ago! Why are we still talking about this? When we finish talking, I kill you.  Okay, okay.  What else you wanna know? Did it make you feel bad? Look, I said I   It was her or me.  Survival of the fittest? Yeah, exactly.  Killing you will be easy but I have another kill I have to do that's not so easy.  So why are you doing it, man? To protect myself.  And my sister.  Exactly.  Survival, right? The normal reasons.  The normal reasons? I've never killed for normal reasons.  I used to think I was special, a special kind of killer but tonight I'm not.  I hear you, bro.  I hear you.  So then what are you, right? What am I? I'm just a creep motherfucker.    Jamie.    Hey, Deb.    Have you seen Dex?   He was supposed to pick up Harrison.  So tired, I put him down in the back office.  You see him, let him know I'm looking for him?   Yeah, of course.    Thanks.  Happy New Year.  What? Fuck, sorry.  Happy New Year.    You wanna dance?   Okay, let's go dance.  Come on.  Oh, slow down, cowboy.  I'll share.  I heard that you broke up with your girlfriend.  She dumped me.  So are you gonna get all sloppy drunk and make an ass of yourself   like when you broke up with Deb?   I was thinking about it.  You gonna hit on me again too? I'm just saying, fair warning.  I do not need my brother to protect me.  And if you don't show me respect I will fuck you up and serve your balls in a shot glass.  How do you make that sound so fucking sexy?   Everything good here?   Just fine.  Yeah? Good.    Hey, hermano.    Hey.  So how's it feel knowing you're putting away your badge? Honestly, a little scary.  All I've been is a cop.  I'm putting it all behind me, you know? Unknown territory.  That takes balls, man.  Oh, hey.  It's almost time.  Where can I go to change? No, you're not gonna put on a diaper and come out as Baby New Year.    Try and stop me.    No.  You're gonna scare people is     Great party.    Thanks.  ls your brother here? He said he was gonna be here.  Maria too.  Maybe after what happened, they wanna avoid each other.    I'm gonna call, make sure he's okay.    Okay.    Dispatch.    This is Lieutenant Debra Morgan.  I was hoping to get a 20 on LaGuerta's vehicle.  I'll Wait.  Heading north towards the Miami Port, by the shipping yards.    The shipping yards? Are you sure?   That's correct.  Thank you.  Dex.  Whatever you're thinking of doing, please don't do it.  So, what's the plan? I gave LaGuerta half a dose of M99 so it won't be found in her system.  I'll use her gun to shoot Estrada in his puncture wound.  Destroying any evidence that he was stabbed.  And then? Tell me.  I'll use Estrada's gun to shoot LaGuerta.  So it'll look like they killed each other.  Yes.  Dexter.  Where will this end? Shit, Dex, what have you done? Deb? Oh, God.  Dex.  You shouldn't be here.  Why shouldn't I be here? What are you doing? What needs to be done.    Are you gonna kill her?   You need to leave.    I need to finish this.    Dexter, you can't.  I can and I will.  Enough.  Dexter, you can't do this.  The only solution, the only way to end this.  No, no.  I can't let you go through with this! Shoot him, Debra.  You have to end this.  Shoot him.    Stop!   Do it, Debra.  Shoot him.  Do it! Shoot him! This is not who you are.  You're a good cop.  You're a good person.  You're not like him.  Put him down! It's true.  Everything she said.  You're a good person.  It's okay.  Do what you gotta do.  Dex.  Oh, my God! Oh, my God! We all make rules for ourselves.  It's these rules that help define who we are.  So when we break those rules, we risk losing ourselves and becoming something unknown.  Who is Deb now? Who am I? Is this a new beginning or the beginning of the end?

I have to call this in.  Maybe we should get rid of the body.  Gasoline, fire, it'll erase any trace that we were ever here.  I never wanted her to go through this, Dex.  Neither did I.  I found a blood slide exactly like the ones we found in Doakes' car.  Bad people are still going missing, and Doakes   Was the Bay Harbor Butcher, end of story.  I have to keep my secret safe.  Otherwise my life, her life, will never be the same.  Are you a serial killer? I only kill certain kinds of people.  Oh, God.  Are you the Bay Harbor Butcher? Dad taught me.  He gave me a code.  Dad knew? You're like a magnet.  Bad shit is gonna find you.  Dexter is a blood spatter analyst and Doakes always thought something was off about him.  What if Doakes was on to him? The Bay Harbor Butcher.  Maria thinks it might be you.  Me? Hannah McKay.  She stabbed a woman five times.  All I can think about is giving her what she deserves.  Do what you gotta do.  Dexter You're the only person I don't have to hide anything from.  Maybe you understand me a little better than I understand myself.  I love you.  It's because she's a serial killer? If you love me, you'll accept this.  If I love you? I'm in love with you! Wha  ? Debra's been in a car accident.  You poisoned Debra.  You were supposed to choose me.  She's my sister.  Goodbye, Dexter.  Security footage from before the fire department got the call on the burning church.  What were you doing there, lieutenant? Are we really that fucked? If all she's got is that DVD, I can handle this.  LaGuerta's an innocent.  She doesn't even meet the code.  It's the only option.  Hector Estrada.  I was three years old when you murdered my mother.  You're Dickie Moser! Dexter Moser.    I have another kill I have to do.    It's not so easy.  I can't let Deb go down for what I did.  It's Deb.  Whatever you're thinking, please don't do it.  So, what's the plan? I use her gun to shoot Estrada in his puncture wound.  Use Estrada's gun to shoot LaGuerta.  Deb.  Dexter? You shouldn't be here.  Why shouldn't I be here? Shoot him, Debra.  You have to end this.  Shoot him.  Stop! Do it, Debra.  Shoot him.  Do it! Shoot him! This is not who you are.  You're a good person.  You're not like him.  Put him down! It's true.  Everything she said.  You're a good person.  Do what you gotta do.  Dex.  I hate you.  There's nothing like a crisis to help define who you are.  A better person would feel bad about LaGuerta's death.  But the truth is it solved all my problems.  It's gotten me back on track.  In the six months since I've coached Harrison's soccer team to a championship gotten the bowling team back together made some new friends.  I'm a survivor.  She chose a career in law enforcement.  And I know for a fact that she never regretted one day of service.  It's a choice that none of us take lightly.  Is Aunt Deb gonna be here? I don't think so, but we'll get together with her real soon.  Maria was very important to me.  She was a good cop.  She was my boss.  Very briefly my wife.  But mostly she was a friend.  I miss you, Maria.  We all do.  Thank you, Lieutenant Batista.  At this time, we would like to dedicate this beautiful memorial in her honour.  Ladies and gentlemen, fellow officers, I present to you the Captain Maria LaGuerta bench.  Okay, well, we're off to swim class.  Say goodbye to Daddy.  Bye, Daddy.  See you after work, Harrison.  Okay.  A bench.  Why a bench? She deserves more than a place where people park their butts.  It's a nice bench.  It's concrete, very sturdy.  You can buy them at the parking lot at Home Depot.  I'm sorry.  Was that insensitive? No, that's exactly my point.  This all feels so cold.  You're still hurting, I can tell.  All right, look, first of all, it's weird when you try to speak Spanish.  Second, don't ever touch me.  It's been six months.  You're having a tough time moving on.  How am I supposed to move on? My dining room is filled with boxes of her stuff.  He's right, you know? It's been six months.  Maybe you should just get rid of it.  And then what? She just disappears? Hey, Dex, I was kind of hoping your sister would stop by.  Yeah, how is Deb? She really wanted to be here, but she's working long hours.  She's better? Oh, yeah, she's great.  That's good to know.  Yeah, she took LaGuerta's death kind of hard, even though they didn't seem all that close.  There's no telling how you're gonna react.  You know, when Mike Anderson was killed, I just wanted to get away from all this.  It took Maria's death to turn me back.  It made me want to do nothing but chase bad guys.  I can't tell you how many times all I wanted to do is what Deb did, walk out of here at lunch and never come back.  Yeah, Deb can be impulsive sometimes.  Tell her to drop by sometime.  Place isn't the same without her.  For a while, I heard from her every other day, asking for some favour, but I haven't spoken to her in a couple weeks now.  Why is that? She's out of town.  Right.  The Keys.  No, Fort Lauderdale.  Right.  Fort Lauderdale.  Well, when she gets back, let's set something up.  It'd be good to see her.  Yeah, it would.  I mean, I'll tell her.  It's Deb.  Leave a message.  The user's mailbox is full.  Hey, Vince.  Can you cover for me this morning? I always do.  Deb's working through this in her own way.  I just wish she'd talk to me once in a while.  Ooh aah.  Supposed to be for both of us.  Mm.  I'm sorry.  I guess I got carried away.  You're gonna have to share.  Gotta take this.  Business.  Okay.  Yeah.  No, I'm not splitting it up.  All or nothing.  That is my best price.  You've never worked with me before, but you know it's a fair deal.  It's 11:47 a. m.  You have till tomorrow at this exact time.  Fucking amateurs.  What happened to your normal guys? I don't know.  They disappeared on me.  Funny thing, being a fence doesn't seem to be a long term occupation.  What about this guy? Can you trust him? Can you trust anybody? Uh uh.  Maybe if you want, I can back you up.  I don't want you involved.  Yeah, but I'm really   Debbie.  I appreciate it Ha ha.  but I got it covered.  Ahh.  What do you want to do today? Preferably something that involves you in a bikini.  Why don't we rent a boat? Like a pontoon, little thing, we could go out, relax on the water.  No, get something fast.  Let's get a speedboat.  We can buzz the cruise ships.  You like causing trouble, don't you? I can't help it.  It's funny how these things work, isn't it? What do you mean? Like when I met you, I'd been in that bar for almost an hour.  I was about to leave.  Then you walked in.  Yeah, I did.  It's funny how something so simple as you walking in the door at the exact right moment can suddenly change everything.  Yeah.  What are you doing here, Dexter? She could be inside.  You know what she's been going through.  She could've done something.  Deb.  Deb, you in here? She's not here, Dexter.  She asked you to leave her alone.  For how long? I haven't talked to her in over a month.  I haven't seen her in two months.  She's disappeared.  She's disappeared from you, Dexter.  And that's her choice.  What is this? Xanax.  Paxil.  Adderall.  More Xanax.  All from different doctors.  And pot.  Great, she's mixing all this shit.  I have to find her.  Dexter, you're the problem, not the solution.  The best thing you can do for Debra is to stay away from her.  I'm the only one who knows what happened.  I'm the only one who can help her.  She needs me.  It's Deb.  Leave a message.  The user's mailbox is full.  I have to find her.  Hi.  Hi.  Can I help you? Yeah, I'm   Dexter Morgan.  Elway.  Nice place.  Thank you.  Yeah, yeah, it's a big step up from my robbery desk at Miami Metro, huh? And it's a good change for Deb as well.  Very smart of her, making a move to the private sector, I'll tell you.  She here? She is not.  You know when she'll be back? Not a clue.  She's got a big problem of disappearing on me.  What does that mean? She don't like to check in when she's supposed to.  When's the last you heard from her? Been a couple of weeks, at least.  And that's normal for her? Of course not normal.  Debra Morgan.  There's no \"normal\" for her.  That was the deal when I hired her.  She's her own agent, she chooses the cases she wants to work on, and she calls in when she feels like it.  But But what? She's never waited two weeks to call me back.  What case is she working on? Some smash and grab.  Guy skipped out on bail.  Uh Name is Briggs.  Andrew Briggs.  Skip tracing, bounty hunting? Isn't that beneath her? Tell me about it.  I try to give her bigger clients, higher profile cases, but she seems to like the down and dirty stuff.  Your sister's a bit of a thrill seeker.  Really? Easy money for her.  Gets a percentage of everybody she brings in, so Well, what else can you tell me about the case? Not much more to it.  Find him, bring him back.  If she brings the jewellery, she gets a cut.  That's all you know? Like I said she's not big on checking in, so I gotta go.  If you hear from her, call me, all right? Is this how I'm going to find Deb? Dead and alone? Are you looking at my ass? No.  I mean, yes.  What size do you wear? None of your damn business.  It's just that I have all of Maria's clothes, and I just thought maybe Oh.  Yeah, no, it's   It's not your style.  I get it.  She was a very colourful woman.  Hey, what do we have? Robert Bailey, 42 years old, Miami resident.  Killed by a single gunshot wound to the chest, right above the heart.  Judging from the stippling on the wound, it looks like the muzzle was in contact with the chest when fired.  Suicide? No, the victim was killed elsewhere and dumped here.  Whoa.  Parietal and occipital bone sliced through.  Back of the cranium removed.  Okay, that's weird.  And looks like a piece of it has been scooped out, like with a melon baller.  Just got weirder.  We have a gun.  So someone shoots this guy, cuts his head open, and messes with his brain.  He takes the body and the weapon and brings them all the way out here.  Why? People are crazy.  I think we're done here.  Okay, process the gun for DNA and prints.  With the rain Yeah, do it anyway.  Dexter, follow up on the body.  Will do.  It's Deb.  Leave a message.  The user's mailbox is full.  Where the hell are you, Deb? Andrew Briggs.  The man Deb was looking for.  Clubbed a security guard over the head, robbed a high end jewellery store.  Got away with over a half a million in unrecovered merchandise.  Skipped on his bail, been on the run ever since.  Arrested three times for assault.  Sent one guy to the hospital with a broken jaw.  This guy is dangerous.  Did Debra get in over her head? \"Password\"? Nope.  \"Fucking password. \" Here we go.  All of her charges for three weeks have been in Fort Lauderdale.  And mostly at El Mercado on East 4th Street.  She was there yesterday afternoon.  I can be there in half an hour.  That's the guy she's supposed to bring in.  What kind of tequila you like? The kind that makes you fall down.  I'll see what I can do.  Hmm.  What the fuck? Deb, what's going on? I'm working a case.  You should get the fuck out.  You found your guy.  Why haven't you brought him in? How do you know what I'm doing? I talked to Elway.  You talked to Elway? He said you hadn't checked in.  I was scared something happened.  I'm fine.  You should get out.  Deb, you haven't talked to me in weeks.  You haven't returned any of my calls.  You completely missed LaGuerta's memorial.  Jesus Christ, I wonder why.  And would you please erase the messages on your phone? No one has heard from you.  Yeah, I'm fucking getting close to Briggs so that I can get the jewellery before he fences it, all right? I'm a professional working a case.  Why don't you get out of here before you ruin it? You having sex with that guy? What the fuck? My life is none of your business.  Go.  No, I'm not leaving.  Fuck you.  Do you wanna know why I'm not returning your phone calls? Because I don't wanna talk to you.  And I really don't wanna fucking see you.  Why? Why? Um Because you made me compromise everything about myself I care about.  And I hate you for it.  No, you don't.  I shot the wrong person in that trailer.  Who's this guy? Just some loser.  Is there a problem? Let's go.  She doesn't hate me.  She's messed up.  She doesn't know what she's doing.  It's none of your business.  She's using this job as a way to escape.  She can't deal with everything that's happened.  She's lost, Dad.  You've done this to her.  Don't make it worse.  Leave her alone.  Motherfucker cut me off.  Dexter, what are you doing? Hey, what's going on? You cut me off.  I'm sorry.  I didn't   You lost control out there, Dexter.  He knows what he did.  Go home, son.  Right there Oh.  Stop.  Don't stop.  Don't stop.  Don't stop.  Jamie, I'm home.  Oh, God   You stopped.  Someone just came in.  It's just Angel.  Yeah, what? What? I'm sorry, I can't have sex with my lieutenant 20 feet away.  I'm not having a problem.  That's because you're fucking superhuman.  Oh, come on.  Joey, the chance that someone might find out our little secret I know.  Not gonna happen.  makes it even more fun.  It's not gonna happen.  Come to my place tomorrow morning, we can finish where we left off.  I can't.  I have to be at Dexter's by 7.  What? Fuck.  Mm.  Mm.  Do me a favour? Distract him so I can go out the side door, okay? How am I supposed to do that? Throw some fucking pork rinds on the floor.  You owe me.  Hey.  You're all sweaty.  Uh Yeah.  It's good that you're working out.  Yeah, just doing a little cardio.  What are you gonna do with Maria's stuff? Don't worry.  It'll be gone by tomorrow.  Where? Charity workers are coming in first thing in the morning.  Feels sad, though.  An entire life just packed up in a bunch of boxes.  You know, maybe you should pick out some things to keep.  Come on.  I think it'll be good.  You're right.  You're right.  You're right.  Warrants to trace Dexter's and Deb's phone.  Right to the end, she couldn't let it go.  Tracking down Estrada by herself, that's what got her killed.  Yeah, well, that's just who she was, Angel.  Yeah.  A cop.  That's who she was.  Deb should be up there leading this briefing.  I have to find a way to get through to her.  This doesn't look good.  Who do you think she is? Methinks a riddle, wrapped in Dolce & Gabbana inside a   Can't you ever talk like a normal person? Everyone, your attention, please.  As you can see, we have a guest.  This is Dr.  Evelyn Vogel.  She and I first met when she consulted on a case.  When most of you were in high school.  Dr.  Vogel's been away from Miami for a number of years but she's back and has graciously offered her expertise with our recent body dump.  But we're only a day into our investigation.  I'm not here to step on anyone's toes, lieutenant.  It's off the books.  Evelyn is a neuropsychiatrist.  She's served as a consultant on high profile cases over the years.  And she has written the definitive textbook on the brains of psychopaths.  That's how I know you.  Your work on profiling is classic.  Thank you.  I wouldn't normally insert myself into an investigation.  She said \"insert herself. \" When I read about the body in the paper, there was one aspect of this murder that I found particularly intriguing.  Vince, bring up that x ray the M. E.  sent over.  Thank you.  You see this part here? That's the anterior insular cortex, the portion of the brain that processes empathy.  And the hallmark of a psychopath is They have no empathy.  they have no empathy.  Now, it's possible this is mere coincidence but if someone goes to the trouble of carefully extracting a core from the brain, I think they'll give some thought to what part of the brain he's taking.  So why do you think he did this? It's too early to say, but maybe he wanted to perform an experiment, or maybe this was simply a message.  He wouldn't be the first killer to attempt to communicate through a victim.  Who was the victim? Robert Bailey.  Mechanic.  According to his wife, been missing for nearly a week.  Was the brain drilled into while the victim was still alive? Dexter? The ME indicated it was done post mortem.  The preliminary autopsy also showed bruising on the knuckles and knees, which could indicate the victim was held captive in an enclosed space.  There were no contents in the victim's stomach.  Signs of dehydration.  The victim was missing for five days.  That suggests a pretty elaborate pre kill ritual for a serial killer.  This was just one body.  How do you know it's a serial killer? Oh, I doubt that this is his first kill.  Those are usually more spontaneous.  This was planned ahead of time.  A lot of thought went into it.  I'm thinking we're looking for someone at least in their 30s.  Intelligent, organised.  Takes great pride in his work.  I think he'd enjoy the fact that we're talking about him right now.  You think there will be more? I'd be surprised if there are not.  Any suspects? No prints on the gun.  It sat in the rain all night.  Same story with the body.  We're still combing for DNA.  Okay, let's widen our interviews with friends and co workers of the victim.  We need to find where he intersected with the killer.  Masuka, when ballistics comes in   On your desk.  Dexter, stay on the DNA.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  I hear the FBI calls her the Psychopath Whisperer.  How lucky are we she's on this case? Yeah.  How lucky.  Dr.  Evelyn Vogel, neuropsychiatrist, lecturer, just published her third book.  And the last person I need looking in my direction right now.  What do you think? It's nice, right? I guess so.  Maria always had it in her office.  I want you to have it to remember her by.  Oh, thanks.  That's nice.  You still haven't forgiven her? It's complicated.  It's all right.  I understand.  But if you can't accept it from Maria, accept it from me.  It'll make me feel better.  Now, I know things were awkward between the two of you before Maria so tragically died.  So tragically died   She died because she wouldn't leave things alone.  I don't know why I said that.  Sorry.  I hope you find it in your heart to forgive her.  Yo, Dex bot.  Vogel wants your presence in the morgue.  Great.  El Sapo.  Hello, Mr.  Toad.  You stay in here.  I'm gonna meet him outside.  Are you selling the stuff? Well, I don't have it on me, but I'm gonna give him a little show.  Deb, hey.  Been a while.  How are you? I'm working on a case.  Andrew Briggs.  All business, huh? I only have a fucking second, okay? So can you look into someone named \"El Sapo\" for me? Hold on.  Who is he? He's a fucking fence.  I'll run it by the guys in Robbery as soon as I get   You're welcome.  How'd it go? I'm gonna be rich.  Dr.  Vogel? I got a message you wanted to see me.  Yes.  Thank you for coming.  I was wondering if you'd had any luck with finding DNA on the body.  No.  We found a few hairs, but they all belong to the victim.  Ah.  So the killer will have to be found the old fashioned way.  Boots to the ground.  Yeah, I suppose.  Quinn and Batista having any luck? Not as far as I know.  The victim led a quiet life.  No enemies.  Serial killers don't have enemies.  Everyone's a potential victim.  Well, if you need anything else, just pick up the phone.  Anybody at the lab can help you.  I was interested to have your take on this case.  Me? Why? I'm the blood guy.  The blood guy.  How did you end up here? My dad was a cop.  He kind of steered me away from that.  This seemed like a better fit.  I was drawn to forensics too.  But I chose to focus on neuroscience.  Psychopaths.  We both chose murder.  Maybe we're both a little crazy.  Maybe.  Mad scientists trained to look at this as a biological mass.  A body part.  Yet somehow, from all those firings of neurons, something intangible emerges.  Emotions.  Trust, morality, love.  Unless you're a psychopath.  But even then, belief systems emerge.  As with the Bay Harbor Butcher.  What was he like? Who? The Bay Harbor Butcher.  James Doakes.  If I'm not mistaken, he worked with you here in Miami Metro.  He was angry.  Had a short fuse.  Well, that doesn't sound right to me.  As a psychopath, he would be disassociated from his feelings, not quick to anger.  Maybe he wasn't a psychopath.  Oh, yes, the Bay Harbor Butcher was definitely a psychopath.  He'd have to be to masquerade the way he did.  But he was an odd one, that's for sure.  You're the expert.  Just the way he picked his victims, persons who, on the whole, had some sort of criminal background speaks to a strong belief system.  Almost as if he operated with some sort of moral guidelines.  Guidelines.  Yet clearly it wasn't a moral choice, as psychopaths have no conscience.  So why else would he kill that way? So he could get away with it as long as he did? People are less likely to miss criminals when they disappear.  Doakes was Special Ops.  Maybe he picked that up there.  Maybe he did.  Makes an interesting case study.  I wish I could have interviewed him.  Sorry.  I look forward to working with you, Dexter Morgan.  Yeah? Oh, Dexter.  Hi.  Come on in.  Come on in.  Thanks.  This Evelyn Vogel   Quite a looker, that one.  Heh.  You know her? Yeah, I know her.  She consulted for us on a couple cases when I was a captain.  Last I heard, she'd moved back to England.  I hadn't talked to her in years.  And she's here now Why? Because a killer took a part of a victim's brain? She called me up out of the blue, said she'd moved back about a year ago.  She asked was I free for lunch, I filled her in on the case, she offered to help.  Why, is she being a pain in the ass? No.  I'm just trying to figure out if she's an asset or not.  Oh.  Well, she's smart.  So use her to your advantage.  Will do.  Why do you think she called now? Like you said, out of the blue? Maybe the stars aligned.  Maybe Mercury is in retrograde.  I don't really care the reason she called.  All I know is this is law enforcement.  You take whatever free help you can get.  So keep her in the loop, Dexter.  Will do.  What if I'm the reason she's here? Hey, when you talk to your sister, can you tell her to check her messages? She asked me for some help, and now I can't reach her.  Will do.  Is this about, uh, Briggs? No, she asked me to look into this fence named El Sapo.  Nobody in Robbery's heard of the guy.  All I know is Briggs robbed the wrong store.  It belonged to some mob guy.  Now nobody's willing to buy what he's selling except this El Sapo guy.  All right.  El Sapo.  Daddy.  Harrison, hey.  What a nice surprise.  No, not a surprise.  We discussed this.  We did? Dex, you know I love working for you, but I need an occasional night off.  Right.  We discussed it.  Okay, I've got his dinner in here.  Spaghetti and meatballs, green beans, chocolate pudding.  Yeah, about tonight, maybe we could   Harrison, those are Daddy's things.  What's this? Bye.  It's a very expensive centrifuge.  Come on, let's get your dinner set up.  Pudding! After dinner.  Pudding! Hello? I thought I made it clear.  You meet me here with the money, and I take you to the stuff.  Yeah, I'll be alone.  Fucking El Sapo is \"El Idiot. \" When he comes here, you keep yourself hidden, okay? Why? Because I don't know him.  Might be freaky.  I wanna go with you.  We talked about this.  I'm not doing anything that might get you hurt.  I'll meet him outside.  You stay in here.  I love this guy.  I love that guy.  El Sapo.  Real name: Javier Guzman.  Harrison, please.  Robbery didn't know the name El Sapo because he's not a fence.  He's a hit man.  Jesus, Harrison! Look at what you did! Uh, I'm sorry.  It's okay.  I'm sorry I yelled.  It's okay.  Just give me a second.  It's Deb.  Leave a message.  The user's mailbox is full.  Come on.  We're going.  If Deb is with Briggs when El Sapo shows up, he might take her out as well.  It's Joey Quinn.  Thrill me.  Quinn, it's Dexter.  Call me.  The fuck! Yeah! I'm coming! The fuck? Hey.  You brought the kid.  What's going on? You didn't answer your phone.  I'm kind of in the middle of something.  Well, I need to get ahold of Deb.  And you need me for that, why? I don't know where she is.  What do you mean, you don't know? I just don't.  Look, I know she's in Fort Lauderdale.  I need to know where she's staying.  She talks to you.  Do you know where she is? Yeah, the last she mentioned she was at this place, the Pink Motel.  Some dump.  Thanks.  Come on.  Was that Dexter? Yeah.  He was looking for Deb.  Fucking strange.  Hmm.  I don't want to talk about that.  Come here.  Mm.  Oh, my God.  Why is the whole world against us? Ignore it.  This is Jamie Batista.  Please leave a message.  Jesus.  Doesn't anybody answer their fucking phone? We're going for a drive.  Okay, Daddy.  It's Deb.  Leave a message.  The user's mailbox is full.  What the fuck? I told you to stay away from here.  I know, but you're in danger.  Someone is gonna kill Briggs.  You need to come with me now.  The fuck I do.  Briggs is about to meet his fence.  I'm gonna make a fuckload of money.  That's who's gonna shoot him.  I'm trying to keep you from getting shot too.  That's bullshit.  No, it's not.  El Sapo isn't a fence.  He's a hit man.  He's gonna get the jewels and kill Briggs.  I know you don't wanna see me, but I had to tell you.  All right, you told me.  It's very dangerous.  I get that.  You need to come with me.  You could die here.  I don't fucking care! Deb.  What? What, aren't you the one always saying that bad people deserve to die? You're not a bad person.  I killed LaGuerta.  It doesn't matter.  It doesn't matter? Jesus fucking Christ, Dexter, it doesn't matter! That's not what I meant! Come on! Deb, it's been months of this.  You can't keep me away forever.  You don't understand anything, do you? I wake up every day, thinking of every bad decision that I ever made because of you.  And it kills me that I can't take any of it back.  I'm sorry.  Don't fucking make that face and say \"I'm sorry\" to me.  Even if it were fucking true, it wouldn't make any difference.  Because we can't undo any of it.  So why don't you go back to your little life and pretend everything's fine but I can't do that because I am not fucking like you! We can talk about this later, but you need to come   No, we fucking can't.  You again? Let's go.  Asshole, get your hands off her.  What the fuck? What did you do? I felt okay around him.  You didn't belong with him.  Fuck.  Fuck! Fuck! Deb   Will you fucking go? Will you go? Please go.  I came here to save you.  No Deb, look at yourself.  You're lost.  I am not lost.  I know exactly where I am.  I am in some shitty fucking hell, which is exactly what I deserve.  But you You are lost.  All my life, I thought I needed you.  That I couldn't survive without you.  Fuck.  Fuck.  It was the other fucking way around.  It was the other way around.  Deb   Fucking go.  Don't   I'll get rid of the body.  No, don't you fucking do anything, all right? I'm gonna handle this.  But if El Sapo comes, he's a hit man   He has no clue who I am.  If he comes and sees   Would you fucking go? I'm gonna call this in.  The police? Yes.  You should go.  I'd like to report a suspected homicide.  Go.  The Pink Motel in Broward.  Oh, fuck.  Harrison? Harrison? Harrison! Harrison! Daddy? Come here, buddy.  Oh.  I couldn't find you.  I'm here, buddy.  I'm right here.  Where are we, Daddy? Lost.  So you work for Elway Investigations.  Did a skip trace on Briggs, you went out for a sandwich, and you found him dead when you got back.  That's it.  Any idea who might want to kill him? No.  We'll call you if we have any more questions.  Elway, I've got a good news, bad news situation here.  Briggs is dead, but I think I have a lead on where the jewellery might be so we might have a shot at coming out ahead but I'm gonna talk to you about it when I get to the office, okay? Bye.  Mm.  Debra was right.  I was wrong.  It's me who's lost.  A better person would let her go.  But I don't know how.  Without her, I don't know who I am anymore.  Dexter? This isn't a good time.  I was hoping to share something with you.  I told you I'm not in the mood for this.  Well, then maybe I can just leave this with you.  Dexter, please.  What is it you want? Please let go.  You can't kill me.  Why? Because I don't fit Harry's code.      Previous EpisodeNext Episode"

        "script": "Previously on Dexter: How is Deb? She's better? Yeah, she's great.  What case is she working on? Briggs.  Andrew Briggs.  Deb, what's going on? I'm getting close to Briggs so I can get the jewellery before he fences it.  You haven't talked to me in weeks.  You made me compromise everything about myself that I care about.  I shot the wrong person in that trailer.  Don't stop.  Don't stop.  The chance that someone might find out our secret makes it even more fun.  You're all sweaty.  Yup.  Just doing a little cardio.  Whoa.  Looks like a piece of it has been scooped out.  That's the anterior insular cortex, the portion of the brain that processes empathy.  This is Dr.  Evelyn Vogel.  Evelyn is a neuropsychiatrist.  I hear the FBI calls her the psychopath whisperer.  What was he like? Who? The Bay Harbor Butcher.  I look forward to working with you, Dexter Morgan.  Can you look into someone named El Sapo for me?   Who is he?   He's a fucking fence.  El Sapo isn't a fence.  He's a hit man.  He's gonna get the jewels and kill Briggs.  I'm trying to keep you from getting shot along with him.  Aah! I came here to save you.  Deb, look at yourself.  You're lost.  You are lost.  Dexter.  I was hoping to share something with you.  What is it you want? You can't kill me.  Why? Because I don't fit Harry's code.  We're recording.  So to review where we are, two weeks ago, you told me that your son Dexter had asked to see the actual scene of a homicide.  You also said that you opposed this request.  Yes.  Because he's only 10 years old.  So why are you here today? He kept asking and asking so I decided to give him what he wanted.  I even started to hope it might shock him out of this condition.  Tell me what happened.  I got a call about a homicide in Coral Gables.  A woman had shot her ex husband as he was trying to break into the house.  I waited until the forensic guys cleared out and then I snuck Dexter onto the scene.  The victim had fallen through a sliding glass door so there was blood everywhere.  And it didn't seem to faze Dexter.  And he wasn't bothered at all? If anything, he was fascinated.  He just stood there, staring.  Like he was admiring a painting.  I remember that day.  It was like a painting.  And I wanted to be the artist.  We didn't stay long, and when we were driving home, I noticed that Dexter was holding something in his hand.  He'd stolen it from the crime scene.  A trophy.  I'm right about Dex, aren't I? There's something wrong with him.  One could put it that way, but I do agree that Dexter is exactly what you suspect him to be.  Trust me when I say that there's a place in this world for your son.  I don't know what it is or what form it will take but we're gonna find it together.  You were only 10 years old when your father first sought my help.  I know almost everything about you, Dexter.  Not just because I heard it from your father but because I helped create you.  Create me? You sound like Dr.  Frankenstein.  Don't mean to.  Don't know how else to put it.  I mean, it was obvious that you not only showed all the classic traits of a psychopath but that you would eventually become a killer.  So we were faced with a little dilemma: what to do with you.  It was me who convinced Harry that your urges couldn't be stopped but they could be focused.  Eventually we realised that hunting animals wasn't going to satiate you so we decided that you could be taught to kill other kinds of animals.  People who truly deserve to die.  You're saying you came up with the code? Harry had a big hand in the details.  His law enforcement background was certainly an asset but he was operating under my guidance.  I can't help but think of myself as your spiritual mother.  I know we've only just met face to face but this is kind of like a reunion.  Heh.  I should have chilled some champagne.  You experimented on me.  That's what mothers do? I developed a framework for your survival.  That's what mothers do.  You made me what I am.  Heh.  You'd have preferred an institution? Death row? I could have turned my back on you.  I could have let Harry do the same.  I could have even notified the authorities.  Why didn't you? Well, let's just say you got under my skin.  I came to care for you, Dexter.  I still do.  Why are you telling me this? I saved your life.  And I'm afraid I need to call in the favour.  I'm sure you recognise this.  It's a section of the human brain.  Anterior insular cortex.  A murder victim was missing the same piece of tissue.  And this is it.  In the flesh.  I found it on my doorstep wrapped in butcher paper.  Unfortunately, there was no return address.  Why would the killer send this to you? A message.  I've come to believe that the killer could be one of my former patients.  This would be the perfect explanation for this little gift.  You think it's a threat.  Hm.  A brain on a doorstep.  Hardly a love letter.  Sooner or later, someone's going to be holding a piece of my brain in a jar.  I want you to find him, Dexter.  And I want you to do what Harry and I taught you to do.  I don't take requests.  You have contacts at the FBI.  You're working with Miami Metro.  Why don't you go to them? I wish I could.  What's stopping you? You're not the first psychopath I've treated.  You taught other people the code? No.  You're special.  But I've used other unorthodox methods, some of which might be considered illegal.  So if the police track down this killer and it's someone I treated   Your unorthodox methods might be exposed and your career would be ruined.  You might even go to jail.  You see my problem.  I see that it's your problem.  This will help put things into perspective.  Don't tell me you're gonna pass up on another piece of your history.  Think about it, but don't take too long.  Killer's out there, Dexter, and I don't mind admitting I'm afraid of what's coming next.  You don't deserve this, but I don't have a choice.  I have to.  I'm sorry.  Dexter killed someone else last night.  Who? A drug dealer.  Guy robbed and killed two of his clients.  College kids.  At least Dexter is following the programme.  He told me something new that he did to the drug dealer before he killed him.  And that was? He made him look at photos of his victims.  Interesting.  Did you ask him why? He said it was something he felt he needed to do.  What do you think it means? Humans are born with an innate sense of justice.  Maybe Dexter is discovering this.  The important thing is, after three kills, he's embracing the process.  It's gonna work out for him, Harry.  I hope so.  She believed in you at a time when I was in doubt.  Vogel gave me this DVD to make me feel as if I owe her something.  Don't you? If she's responsible for creating me, she's responsible for what I've done to Deb.  Maybe Vogel can help you.  Help me how? With Deb.  You must have told Vogel a lot about Deb.  She was part of your life.  I wish she still was.  Deb said she hated me, that she should have killed me inside that shipping container instead of LaGuerta.  Maybe I should just listen to you, stay away from her.  All I'm saying is that Vogel might open up some possibilities.  At the very least, she's a window to your past that you just can't ignore.  I don't trust Vogel.  I can't.  All the more reason to keep her close.  Okay, just so we're on the same page, you're supposed to locate Briggs and take him into custody.  It's that simple, right? I was also supposed to find the stolen jewellery, right? Recover the goods, collect 20 percent? Am I supposed to believe that's what you were doing for two weeks? Just looking for the jewellery? Yes, Elway.  He wasn't gonna just give it to me.  It wasn't lying around the apartment.  I had to play him.  What is that shit? It looks like horse piss.  It's electrolyte replenishment formula.  You look dehydrated.  It impairs your judgement.  Probably fuelling that bad attitude.  So tell me, where does it say undercover work in your job description? I was improvising.  Well, you put one of my assets at risk.  Namely yourself.  That's my call.  Well, your asset is just fine.  I wish I could say the same thing about Briggs.  That again? I told you I don't know what happened.  I came back to our room and he was dead.  \"Our room\"? So you two were intimate? First of all, who says \"intimate\"? And second, what does it even matter? What was I supposed to do, say: \"Hey, can I have that jewellery that you stole because I'd love to get the finder's fee on that too\"? I was doing my job.  If you were, we wouldn't be here with nothing to show for it.  We don't have nothing to show for it.  I found these on Briggs.  This looks like a key to a storage unit.  I bet that's where he stashed the jewellery.  Why didn't you tell me that in the beginning? Because it's more fun to watch you eat crow.  Take a bite.  We haven't found the jewellery yet.  You could be wrong.  But what if I'm not? Then we recover 20 percent.  Right.  And you'll love me for that.  Another morning, another body.  Miami makes more corpses than sunburns.  And I'm thankful.  A crime scene might be the only place left where I can still control the chaos.  Fuck me.  What does this guy think, he's a fucking brain surgeon? The Brain Surgeon.  Anterior insular cortex is missing, just like the last one.  So we have a serial? Vogel was right.  Judging from the lack of blood, I'd say this one was done post mortem too.  No entry wounds.  Ah.  Petechial haemorrhaging around the eyes.  Bruising around the throat.  Asphyxiation.  So the last time, the killer left the murder weapon somewhere near the body.  Maybe he did it again.  So, what are we looking for? Ropes, nylons, giant pillow.  Okay, everyone spread out.  A plastic bag? Not the worst way to asphyxiate someone.  Blood? I think I've got a murder weapon.  Let's hope he left a print.  I got another delivery today.  Like the other? Same section of the brain.  If it is one of my patients who's doing this, I I have to wonder if I could have prevented it.  You never felt guilty about what I was doing? No.  All I ever felt was pride.  Pride? Mm.  You're not evil, Dexter.  You're actually making the world a better place.  Not for everyone.  What do you mean by that? I'm going back to the lab.  We might have a print, which gives us a head start.  So you're going to help me.  You don't seem surprised.  Like I said, even though I've just met you, I know you, Dexter.  Better even than I knew Harry.  Why did he come to you about me? I was an expert witness on a series of homicides that he was working on, and we became friends.  It's a long way from being friends to \"I think my son might be a serial killer. \" Harry was aware of my work on young psychopaths.  And he also knew that I didn't approach the subject in terms of black and white, unlike my colleagues at the time.  And so he just told you everything.  You have to understand that he had no one else to talk to.  Not Doris.  Certainly no one in the force.  And there never was any judgement on my part.  Unlike you towards me.  I'm not judging you.  But you don't trust me.  Which you should have expected.  Since you know me so well.  You nervous? About breaking and entering? Absolutely.  Prison would put a real crimp in my business model.  See, we're not breaking.  We're just entering.  You really had sex with this guy? Shit.  What? What is it? If If I hadn't stayed to try to get the jewellery, if I just brought him in, he'd still be alive.  Don't beat yourself up about it.  After all, it's a criminal we're talking about, right? He was actually all right to hang out with.  He made me forget about my shitty life for five minutes.  And what exactly is so shitty about your life? Other than working for you? Excuse me.  You left Miami Metro to come and work for me.  Wise career choice, I might add.  If you accepted more cases, you may get paid what you're worth.  I left Miami Metro because I was burned out.  Oh.  Right.  Look, I know that's a party line.  Everybody knows Maria LaGuerta was a pain in the ass.  I understand if you wanted to dip your toes   What the fuck are you even talking about? LaGuerta was a good cop.  She was a good fucking person.  Well, note to self: Never talk about anyone Debra Morgan knows.  Understood.  Got it.  Why don't you just be really grateful that I work for you? Because I'm about to make you a fuck ton of money.  It's an unopened bill from a storage facility.  Why didn't F. L. P. D.  find this? Because it just arrived today.  Found a match for our key.  Okay.  Buster's Self Storage.  All right.  Let's go.  I can't.  I've got a new client meeting at the office.  All right, then I'll go alone.  Sh Okay.  Could you hang on? Just   Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Just do me a favour, all right? Just be careful.  If I fuck up, you can always ply me with that electro shite solution.  I'm running the prints from the plastic bag through AFIS right now.  Any hits? Not yet, but if the killer's on the list you gave me, there's a good chance he's already in the system.  It shouldn't take long.  Why don't I remember you? According to you, I was 10 when you started seeing Harry.  I should remember you.  You never met me in person.  Harry forbid it.  Why? He didn't want you to feel like you were   Like you were sick.  He was trying to protect you.  And I respected his wishes, even after he died.  I could have used someone to talk to after Harry was gone.  Someone who knew what I was going through.  You wanted to talk about it? I was young and I was all alone.  Here it is.  Lyle Sussman? Sussman? He wasn't on the list I gave you.  I don't know anyone with that name.  That doesn't mean he doesn't know you.  You're a published author.  But why would he be targeting me? Maybe he has an issue with something you said in one of your books.  Arrested for drunk and disorderly in 1992.  Single.  Has a house on Messina.  Doesn't make sense.  Well, Sussman's print's on the murder weapon.  Forensics don't lie.  Mm.  Look on the bright side.  Maybe this means you did a better job with your patients than you thought.  Oh.  Heh.  Two great minds at work here.  Heh, heh.  Am I interrupting? No.  What's up, Vince? Well, guess who found a bloody fingerprint on the duct tape that was covering the victim's mouth.  You? And guess who it might belong to.  The victim? Our killer.  It's a partial, so it could take some time.  How about you? Anything on the murder weapon? Partial.  Well, okay.  I guess the race is on.  Shit.  Why was it strange that I needed someone to talk to when Harry died? People like you don't usually seek an emotional connection.  Good luck.  It all looks innocent.  Just like my apartment.  Nah.  Either Sussman lost his green thumb or he hasn't been here in a while.  Could he be hiding out at his next kill site? A hunting cabin? Isolated.  The perfect place for a kill.  Lake Nona.  It's a large lake, but at least it's a starting place.  Well, fuck.  You found my jewellery.  Really made my life easier.  Thank you for that.  What the hell's your problem? Bitch.  Fucking nuts.  Yeah, I'm fucking nuts.  Stay down.  You're lucky I don't kill people unless I'm paid to.  Ah.  Ow! I hope Sussman does a better job keeping in touch with his mother than I do with mine.  Any reason why you haven't taken the sergeant's exam? Uh   Just haven't gotten around to it.  Why? Matthews is riding my ass, keeps pushing people on me.  Sanchez, Whitney.  I'd rather have you.  I didn't know you cared.  You better start taking your career more seriously, bro.  Especially if you're gonna be dating my sister.  How'd you know? Because I'm a good detective.  Why'd you try to hide it from me? Uh I thought your head would explode.  Just get your act together.  If you want me to be okay with you and Jamie, earn it.  Man up.  Take the test.  Do you have any idea where your son might be, Mrs.  Sussman? It's very important that we speak with him.  I haven't seen him for days.  Is that normal? Well, it's not out of the ordinary.  He's probably off hunting for the weekend.  So he likes to hunt? Oh, he practically lives for it.  He always brings back something for the quilt.  Isn't this something? It sure is.  Where does he go on these hunting trips? He has a cabin somewhere outside the city.  Do you know the address? No.  Sorry.  That's all I know.  What did you say this was about? We just want to ask him a few questions.  That's all, Mrs.  Sussman.  I wish I could help you, but I don't know what else to tell you.  Oh, you need some more.  Ha, ha.  Oh.  Excuse me.  Can we go? That fucking quilt is freaking me out.  It's like a nightmare in fur.  It's Dispatch.  Damn.  Lake Nona will have to wait.  Hopefully not for long.  What's the word, Vince? Borborygmus.  The sound of gas rumbling through your intestines.  As in, seriously regretting having that super green passion fruit smoothie right about now.  Unh.  Gunshot to the head.  I call and raise you one to the chest.  One in the dash and one in the headrest.  Either the killer was panicky, or he really needs some time at the gun range.  Car's registered to a Javier Guzman.  You think that's him? Based on Guzman's rap sheet, be my guess.  Small time enforcing, murder.  Went by the street name of El Sapo.  El Sapo was the hit man sent to kill Briggs.  If he's been killed is Deb in danger? Dexter Morgan.  Dexter Morgan.  Want to get with the programme? Dex? How do you think this went down, Morgan? Uh   Yeah, sorry.  Driver pulls to a stop, the assailant approaches the car, most likely gun already drawn.  The vic sees the shooter, pulls his weapon, clears the holster, but it's too late.  The gunman opens fire.  I got a second gun in the glove.  Bag it and tag it.  El Sapo's blood is confined to the inside of his car.  This can't be his.  The killer might have been reaching into the car and cut himself.  Dex.  El Sapo.  Deb was involved with these guys.  If someone's taking them out   I know.  I'm on it.  I don't understand, Dexter.  You think you know where Sussman's cabin is but you're not going after him.  I have to do something.  What's more important than stopping this killer? My sister.  Debra's in trouble? Yes.  Ah.  That's what's been eating at you.  I'm coming up on her house.  I have to hang up.  Jesus, Deb.  What the fuck are you doing here? Deb.  I don't want you around.  I thought I made that really fucking clear.  El Sapo is dead.  El Sapo? The man who was sent to take out Briggs.  I know who the fuck that is.  Well, someone shot him in his car.  It looked like an execution.  Do you know anything about this? All I know is what my head feels like right now.  I tried calling.  I was worried about you.  That's touching.  I'm fine.  Fine isn't the first word that comes to mind.  And anybody could have walked in here.  The door wouldn't close so I had to get creative.  What happened? Deb, what happened to your side? El Sapo followed me to the storage unit, where Briggs kept his stash, you know.  We tussled, he got the stuff, end of story.  Except it's not the end of the story.  El Sapo's dead.  It's a better fucking ending.  He deserved it.  And if whoever killed El Sapo comes after you? Nobody's coming after me, Dexter.  How do you know that? Will you not do this, please? What? Give a shit.  Deb, I'm your brother.  You can hate me if you want, but it doesn't change the fact that I care about you.  I didn't want to hate you.  I wanted the opposite.  But it didn't work out that way.  I can't change the way I feel, so Will you go, please? I'm not leaving you.  Jesus fucking Christ, Dexter, get the fuck out.  Go.  Deb doesn't want my help, and Vogel is demanding it.  This is it.  Sussman's cabin.  At least I'm staying ahead of Miami Metro.  Sussman's no stranger to blood and death.  Vogel is wrong.  Everything points to him as the killer.  Except this.  Maybe Sussman had an accomplice who decided to take him out.  A killer like Sussman doesn't use an accomplice.  They're rogues.  He could be the exception.  Yeah, or just the innocent victim like the first two.  Sussman's prints were on the weapon.  He must have been involved.  Sit down, Dexter.  You're getting agitated.  I'm just trying to figure this out.  You have a hard time admitting that you're wrong, but it's all right.  People like you have an inherent need to be right, to feel superior.  You keep talking about me like I'm some kind of alternate species.  Like I'm less than human.  On the contrary.  Have you read any of my books? I haven't gotten around to it.  Well, if you had, you'd know that I believe that psychopaths are not a mistake of nature.  They're a gift.  A gift? They're alpha wolves who helped the human race survive long enough to become civilised.  An indispensable demographic.  You believe that? Did you know that psychopathic traits can be found in the most successful CEOs? In the most effective politicians? Without psychopaths, mankind wouldn't exist today.  Well, there's a lot of mankind that doesn't exist because of them.  Every silver lining Well, one of your indispensable demographics is still out there, killing.  And we're back to zero.  You'll find him, Dexter.  I have faith in you.  So, um, what's going on with Debra? That's between me and her.  It's affecting you.  So it makes it a problem for me too.  We're not going to talk about Deb.  Whatever you want.  Should I come back later? Sorry.  I was just checking to see if Dexter called.  He was looking in on Deb.  Deb? Yeah.  Wow, we're a whole 10 seconds into the date.  I thought we were gonna make it to one minute before you mentioned your old fianc\u00c3\u00a9e.  What are you talking about? Joey, you're always checking in on her or talking about her.  Since we've been together, you're on Deb patrol.  No, I'm not.  Okay.  We'll do an experiment.  Let's see if you can go one whole day without mentioning Debra Morgan.  What is it with you people? I mean   What people? I got your brother on my ass about taking the sergeant's test.  You're on my ass about Deb.  Like, what is this, a fucking Cuban thing? What does Angel have to do with this? He knows we're seeing each other.  He's on my ass about making something out of my life.  \"Man up.  Take the sergeant's test. \" You know what? Maybe I don't want to.  Wait, how does Angel know that we're seeing each other? And what's wrong about trying to better yourself? See? That's what I'm talking about.  You know what? Screw this, okay? I did not get dressed up to argue with you.  Go drink by yourself.  Ja   Why the hell can't you stay out of my personal life? What'd I do? Angel, you know exactly what you did.  Okay, you're putting pressure on Quinn.  We just had a giant argument because of you.  Wait a second.  You know what, I hope you're happy.  It's like, mind your own fucking business, Angel.  If this finds El Sapo's killer, it'll keep Deb safe.  It's Deb's blood.  She killed El Sapo.  Shot him in his car.  Deb.  Deb.  What is she doing here? Morgan.  Sir.  I never got a chance to tell you how disappointed I was that you left the force.  From running Homicide to chasing down bail jumpers.  It's a hell of a career trajectory.  It's not what you think.  Well, I hope it was worth it.  Debra Morgan? As I live and breathe.  If I were to cop a feel now, it wouldn't be sexual harassment anymore.  Hey, stranger.  Hey.  What brings you around? Um, Quinn had some questions about a case, so Is this about El Sapo? Well, he's probably grabbing some coffee.  Every morning when I come in, I walk past it.  I have to turn around, because I still think of it as Deb's office.  No, you probably should have gotten it first, you know.  I never really belonged there.  You know that's BS.  This place ain't the same without you.  We're having some drinks at Papa's tonight.  You should come.  Yeah, I'll try to make it.  Hey.  Thanks for coming in.  Come on.  I would have used the briefing room, but it's taken.  I mean, this is fine though, right? Otherwise fucking everybody'd still be hugging you.  Um Do you wanna go to the coffee truck? No, let's just   Let's do this.  Okay.  El Sapo and Briggs.  What do you want to know? Basically, we've hit a wall.  I was hoping you could open up some leads for us.  What can you tell me? Um I was doing a skip trace on Briggs.  He robbed a jewellery store and made off with like a half million dollars in merchandise.  I got a tip that he was in Fort Lauderdale, and I was staking him out and overheard that he was gonna fence the stuff to El Sapo.  Isn't a skip trace one of those locate and bring them back type of things? Yeah, I was also trying to get a fix on the goods.  What happened the night Briggs was killed? Um He was supposed to meet El Sapo that same night.  I thought they were gonna be a few hours so I went to get a sandwich, and when I came back, F. L. P. D.  was on the scene, and, uh, Briggs had a fucking hole in his chest.  Is she lying to protect me or to protect herself? I can't tell anymore.  I was just wondering if you could take a look at what we've got.  Maybe we could put our heads together, push this thing down the field, you know? Like old times.  Heh.  Um So, what we think is the shooter approached the vehicle from behind, and then El Sapo drew his gun.  And then the shooter Hey, are you all right? Sorry.  Family emergency.  I gotta borrow my sister.  Sure.  Thanks.  What, Dexter? I know you killed El Sapo.  I found your blood at the crime scene.  Fuck.  Tell me what happened.  Talk to me, Deb.  I don't know what happened, all right? I'm a little fucking fuzzy on it.  I was angry.  I wanted the jewels back.  And the next thing I know, I'm standing over a dead body.  You shot at him four times.  You don't remember any of it? He'd just beaten the shit out of me.  I was a little fucked up.  Why didn't you call the police? I didn't know what I could tell them.  You could have called me.  You get me into trouble, not out of it.  Is that why you lied to me? All of a sudden we have a problem with lying? We found a gun in El Sapo's glove box.  Is it yours? Shit, it might be, yeah.  He took it off of me before he beat me up.  It'll be traced to you.  How will you explain that? You could switch it out.  Get rid of it.  What if I weren't here to cover your ass? You really want to play the \"what if\" game? What if you weren't a serial killer? What if Harry had left you in that shipping container? That's enough.  El Sapo's not the first person I shot.  And he may not be the fucking last.  What's that supposed to mean? Anything can happen in this hellhole that is now my life.  Your gift to me, Dexter.  She's right.  Whoever Deb was before killing LaGuerta, that person is dead.  I just wish I knew what's taken her place.  Busy day? Crazy busy.  Then maybe they haven't tested Deb's gun yet.  I've covered evidence for myself more times than I can remember.  But I'll never get used to doing this for Deb.  You and Jamie patch things up? How did you know we were fighting? Because I'm a good   Detective, right.  Yeah.  Uh, the sergeant's test? Yeah? I'm gonna start studying for it.  Damn.  Eh, you gonna make an okay sergeant.  If not, I'll demote your ass.  Dr.  Vogel says that psychopaths are not a mistake of nature.  They're a gift.  But what kind of gift destroys everything it cares about? Hello? Dexter, I think there's someone inside my house.  How do you know? Well, I just walked up, and the front door is open.  Get in your car and stay there.  If someone was inside when I called, he's still in there.  I haven't seen anyone leave.  Wait here.  Thank you, Dexter.  Are you sure there's no one inside? I checked the entire house.  I'm sure.  That DVD, it's not mine.  Put it in.  He was coerced.  And now he's dead.  I was wrong all along.  You were right.  Sussman was never a real killer.  He's just another victim.  I should have listened to you.  You were only doing what you thought was right.  We had no idea that   You should have no idea.  You've never done this before.  Me, it's what I do.  The one thing I've always been good at.  Vetting, stalking, and killing people.  I can't even do that anymore.  What you're feeling now, it's not because of the killer.  I've destroyed Deb.  She's gone.  You were wrong about me.  I'm a mistake.  You're exactly what you need to be, Dexter.  You're perfect.      Previous EpisodeNext Episode"

What we think is the shooter approached the vehicle from behind.  El Sapo drew his gun.  I know you killed El Sapo.  What if I weren't here to cover your ass? You really wanna play that game? What's going on with Debra?   It's between me and her.    It's affecting you.  We're not going to talk about Deb.  I thought we'd make it to one minute before you mentioned your fianc\u00c3\u00a9e.  I got your brother on my ass about taking the sergeant's test.  You're on my ass about Deb.  Interior insular cortex is missing, just like the last one.  So we have a serial.  Vogel was right.  \"Lyle Sussman. \"   I don't know anybody by that name.    It doesn't mean he doesn't know you.  He was coerced.  Sussman was never a real killer.  He's just another victim.  You were wrong about me.  I destroyed Deb.  I'm a mistake.  You're exactly what you need to be.  Daddy? Harrison? Daddy? Harrison? Daddy? Harrison? My tummy hurts.  Harrison, did you eat a whole box of popsicles? Harrison.    Why?   Because I love them.  All right.  Come on.  Drink this.  It'll make you feel better.  I promise.  Good boy.  A tiny shot of pink is all it takes to fix my son's pain.  I just wish it were that easy to help Deb.    What?   Lieutenant Morgan? Formerly known as.  Have you been drinking? There a problem, officer? Well, yes.  You're in a car, drunk, with an open container.  Several, actually.  Well, at least I pulled over.  I've had a really bad couple of days.  Maybe you could just cut me some slack?   I wish I could, but     But what? There's been damage to city property.  Property damage? Are you fucking kidding me? I'm gonna need you to get out of the car, please.  Oh, mother shit.  Is there someone I can call? Your brother? No, fucking don't call Dexter.  Quinn.  Yeah.  I'll be right there.  Is everything okay? Yeah.  Just cop stuff.    Okay.    I'll call you later.  Okay.    Deb.    I'm up.  You okay? I feel like I got hit by a truck.  Jesus, Deb.  Oh, God, please, just save me the lecture, okay? My head hurts like a motherfucker.  I'm not gonna lecture you.  They book you yet? No, not yet.  They kept me out of the drunk tank, though.  Thank God for professional courtesy.  All right.  Let me see if I can get you out of this.  Hey.  How you doing? Can I get a little help? What can I do for you? Deb's had me on such a roller coaster I actually appreciate walking into familiar territory.  Lyle Sussman's cabin.  But where's the body? Dex? This is our guy, Sussman.  The Brain Surgeon.  Not exactly.  Did the real Brain Surgeon restage the crime scene obscuring any evidence that Sussman's body was ever hanging from a hook in the back of his skull? Give me a hand? His front teeth are broken.  Looks like Sussman put this shotgun in his mouth, and blam blew his head off.  Or someone put the gun in his mouth and pulled the trigger post mortem.  GSR on Sussman's hands.  Maybe he finally found his conscience, couldn't live with what he did.  No note, though.  Ah, suicide.    Makes our lives so much easier.    You should put that on a T shirt.  Whoever's after Vogel wants the cops off the case.    Is Vogel here yet?   I just called her.  Where the fuck is Quinn? You can thank me later.  You still keep a stash of gum in here? I can smell my own breath.  You sure you want to go to work after spending the night in the station? I mean, I could take you home.  You could shower.  I keep deodorant in my desk.  Thanks for the ride.  Deb, wait.  What?   Should I be worried?   About what? About you.  Think you might have a problem? You mean like a drinking problem? I'm just saying.  Are you serious? You, of all people   accusing me of a drinking problem?   Not accusing you of anything.  How many times have you shown up at a crime scene smelling like booze? A lot, okay? Which means I've been down this road, so I get it.  I'm not down any fucking road.  But at least when I was spinning out, I had a reason.    What do you mean, you had a reason?   You, dumb ass.  You turned down my proposal.  That was my reason.  So, what's yours? Maybe I just don't know my own limits, or something.    I didn't     That's my boss.  I gotta go.  Deb   You might want to straighten up.  We have a new client coming in at 9.  I'm frightened.  He's escalating, and we're left to play catch up.  I'll run tests at the lab, but I'm guessing this tissue belongs to Sussman.  Explains why the killer blew his head off with a shotgun so nobody'd notice the pieces were missing.  What part of the brain is it? It's the occipital lobe.  It's responsible for vision.  He's sending us a message.  He's watching us.  That, and the \"His\" and \"Hers\" boxes? He's aware of me now, not just you.  I'm sorry, Dexter, to have dragged you into this.  He sent both packages to you.  Maybe doesn't know how to find me.  Probably doesn't even know my name.    Yet.    Yeah, I know.  I need to get to him before he gets to me.  I've been going through your book and cross referencing it with the source files and list of suspects.  Any progress? I managed to clear the first two names.  So who's next? Ron Galuzzo.  According to your files, he strangled his best friend in high school but convinced you that it was a bully? Yeah.  It's rare that someone can fool me like that.  At his hearing, I argued for leniency but when I eventually got him to admit he'd been lying I reversed my recommendation.  So if Galuzzo read your book and recognised his story   He would've realised that he'd been institutionalised until he was 21 because of me.  That's a pretty good reason to hold a grudge.  Dex.  Excuse me.  It's about your sister.  What about her? She got brought in for a DUI last night.  Shit.  I managed to get her out of it, but still, it was pretty bad.  She asked me not to say anything so I feel like a shit friend for telling but I'm worried about her.  What the fuck's going on?   She's been having a hard time.    Yeah, I know.  But, man, this is, like, a whole new level.  What are we gonna do? I'll figure something out.  Thanks for the heads up.  I'm putting you up for sergeant, and you show up late? Are you trying to make me look like an asshole? Sorry.  I had a situation.  You want a situation? Come to the cabin.  What is it? It's Deb.  She was brought in for a DUI I need to check on her.  Is alcohol an issue for her? I'm an issue for her.  She's acting this way because of me.  But you can't keep taking on your sister's problems, especially right now.  It's my fault, okay? Deb found out what I am.  She knows everything.  Everything? How? It's a long story.  Just suffice to say, she's not handling it well.  You do really feel badly, don't you? Are you analysing me now?   It's just so unusual.    It's really not a good time.  Most of the time, when people think their partner's having an affair their partner's having an affair.    But not always, right?   No, certainly not always.  This is for you.  My assistant will explain the retainer and payment schedule and we'll get back to you when we've found something.  So nervous.  Is that normal, to be nervous? Well, people go through a wide range of emotions.  I think the important thing is finding out the truth.  Don't look at me.  I think the truth is overrated.  Call us if you have any questions, and we'll be in touch.  Yeah.    Thank you.    Thanks.  Well, it looks like we have to work on our client relation skills.  Are we done? I need a fucking nap.  No, we're not done.  I've got something for you.  What is that? A fucking shit shake? Special custom made supplement formula.  It's got vitamins, some electrolytes, a couple Chinese herbs.    It'll knock the hangover right out.    How do you know I'm hung over?   Thank you.    You're welcome.  It's your brother.  Awesome.  Fucking awesome.  What do you want? I heard about what happened last night.  Fucking Quinn.  He's worried about you.  We both are.  You almost got a DUI? I think the operative word is \"almost. \" It's not a big deal.  It's a very big deal.  This is why I didn't tell you.  Knew you'd freak out.  I'm not freaking out.  I'm just trying to help.  Fuck, Dexter.  I don't have time for this, you know? I have to find out if some asshole is banging some chick which he probably is, so I can tell her and she can get a killer divorce settlement and they can move on with their stupid, fucking boring lives and I can move on with mine.    Because this is my life now.    Well, it wasn't always.  How about dinner tonight?   We can talk.    I don't want to talk to you.  Well, I'm gonna keep showing up here until you do.  If I agree to dinner, will you leave? Yes.  Fine.  Great.  I'll pick you up at 8.  ME's report is back from the cabin.  They've officially ruled Lyle Sussman's death as a suicide.  So with that, the Brain Surgeon case is officially closed.  Okay.  I'll call Evelyn, thank her for her help.  Evelyn? Someone's got a high hard one for the good doctor.  What did I say about standing so close? Any progress on that El Sapo shooting? Still no leads.  I've been going back and forth with Fort Lauderdale P. D.  Apparently, El Sapo was a suspect in the stabbing of a smash and grab lowlife by the name of Andrew Briggs.  The cops will never find out that Deb killed El Sapo.  So right now, I can focus on protecting Vogel and myself.  Ron Galuzzo.  He could be hunting me right now.  Or he could be selling fitness equipment at the mall.  Good work today, everyone.  Deputy chief, got a sec? Wanted to let you know I've been thinking about what you said, finding a new sergeant.  And I've got my eye on Joey Quinn.  Quinn? No way.    He's not sergeant material.    He's a good cop.  He's irresponsible, unpredictable not to mention unintelligible.  No way he can pass that sergeant exam.  He'll pass.  If you say so.    Are you getting all this?   Yeah.  This guy's making this way too easy for us.  Yeah, it's really fucking classy.  So tell me, who's the guy that dropped you off this morning? Who? Quinn? He's a friend.  Kind of friend that drops you off in last night's clothes? God, we're not sleeping together, if that's what you're implying.  Not that it's any of your business.  No judgement, no judgement.  You are certainly allowed to be a player   if you so choose.    What makes you think I'm a player? First there's Briggs, then there's your new friend.  Well, he's not a new friend.  We used to date, just not anymore.  Really? So what happened? He proposed.  I said no.  Jesus Christ.  He's certainly a better man than I am.  Woman turns down my proposal, I'm not gonna stay friends with her.  Yeah, but that's just because you're a giant pussy.  Yes.  Could be.  Ron Galuzzo.  If he is a killer, then a mall is the perfect watering hole for him to choose his prey.  So any of our products is gonna make you stay in the shape that you are.  And I need to do some more work, so I'll see you a little bit later, okay? It was dark at Sussman's cabin.  Does he recognise me? You've got a keen eye, my friend.  The Chiseller 300.    Top of the line.    Or is he just trying to make a sale? Just looking for an all over workout, maximise my time.    Mind if I take a body measurement?   Sure.  Looks like you're already in pretty good shape.  Oh, you have a very low fat to muscle ratio.  Well, thanks.  I do what I can, you know.  Yeah, this equipment is more for beginners people who don't already have an established routine.  Does he know who I am? Is he trying to get rid of me? I'm just looking to change up my workout.  I'd love any suggestions.  That baby cut you up faster than a chef at Benihaha.    Come on, give it a try.    Okay.  He doesn't seem to recognise me.  Careful.  Maybe a grudge against Vogel will be harder to hide.  I like to read when I work out.  Keeps me from getting motion sickness.  This one, I can't put down.  Heard of it? I'm not much of a reader.  You probably heard of the author.  She's pretty famous.  They call her the Psychopath Whisperer.  Dr.  Evelyn Vogel?   Never heard of her.    Of course he's heard of Vogel.  She treated him.  He's lying.  You know, a fit guy like you you need to get up to at least level five to feel the full effect.  But why lie, unless he has something to hide? Yeah, I feel it.    Yeah?   Oh, yeah.  Don't forget to breathe.  You went to see Galuzzo? You could have exposed us both.  It was worth the risk.  He's definitely hiding something.  So now what? I break into his house tomorrow, when he's at work try to find evidence that he's our man.  And in the meantime, what if he comes for me? Do you have any way to protect yourself? A gun.  I haven't used it for years.  Keep it loaded and call me if you need me.  I'm meeting Deb for dinner.    I'll check in with you later.    Wait.  Just   There's one thing I was wondering about since we last spoke.  Yes? When Harry and I came up with the code he insisted that you only kill bad people.  And I insisted that the first rule of the code be: \"Don't get caught. \" Giving you a little wiggle room.  Okay.  So my question is this: When your sister found out about who you were and what you were doing   why didn't you kill her?   What? Not that I'd advocate such a thing but since Debra knew the truth about you, she's clearly a risk   I would never kill Debra.  She's my sister.  I love her.  What exactly do you love about her? What do you mean? When a psychopath speaks about love it doesn't really mean the same thing as for typical people.  So what do you love about her? I don't know.  I love having steaks and beer with her and until recently the fact that she was always there for me, the way she looked up to me.  But none of that is really about Debra.  It's about what she does for you.  So you're saying I'm selfish? I'm not criticising.  Selfless love is hard enough for typical people.  And for psychopaths it's impossible.  Why are you telling me this? So I'll feel bad about myself? Quite the contrary.  I want you to revel in what you are.  I told you, you're perfect.  How can you say that when you know what I've done to Deb? That's my point.  You're perfect as a psychopath.  All this talk about helping Debra, and loving her it's like you're Michelangelo trying to play the banjo.  I'm trying to be a good brother.  Why don't you let me help Debra? Because she wouldn't even listen to you.  I'm the only one who understands her.  Dexter, you admitted to being the cause of her pain.  How can you expect to be the solution? I can handle Deb.  I've been doing it my entire life.  All right, next question.  Physically evasive movements to defeat an officer's attempt to control is: A, active aggression, B, physical resistance C, active resistance, D, active evasion? B, active aggression.  Okay, active aggression is actually A.  And B, it's wrong.  The answer is C, active resistance.  Wait, I'm confused.  Of course you are.  Matthews was right.  You're a fucking lost cause.  Jesus, Angel.  Easy.  Yeah, Angel.  Easy.  I stuck my neck out on the line for you with Matthews.  You better not fuck this up.  Will you please cut him some slack? He's tired from being called out in the middle of the night on that case.  What case? There's no case.  I'm I'm gonna let you guys talk.  So where did you really go at 4 a. m. ? Deb was in trouble and needed my help.  She's been going through kind of a hard time.  And why did she call you? Why not her brother? I don't think they're getting along, you know, and she's a friend.    I couldn't say no.    She's more than a friend.  I mean, you used to fuck her.  And now she's calling you for everything.  What am I supposed to think? Jamie, I swear to you, there is nothing going on between me and Deb.  Then why lie about it? Because I didn't think you'd understand.  Well, you're right.  I don't.  Enjoy your dinner.  The fuck are we doing in this hellhole? Can I get you something to drink? We have a wide array of cocktails.  I'll take a bourbon, neat.  Thank you.  Two cokes, please.  I knew this was a mistake.  I wanted to show you something.  You see that man over there? The father?   Yeah.    Does he look familiar? Fuck if I know.  Fuck.  He's wearing Kevlar.  Don't fucking move! So what, Dex? That was a long time ago.  Yeah, but look.  See this guy, the guy you saved? That's him.  Right there.  His little girl wouldn't have a father if it weren't for you.  That's why I brought you to this hellhole, to show you that.  I know you think you're a bad person after all that happened, but you're not.  You're a good person.  You brought a lot of good to the world.  I'm fucking starving.  Have a nice day at the mall.  I realise this is not the outcome you were hoping for but it can help with a favourable divorce settlement.  If you want, we can forward those to your attorney.  I don't know.  You don't have to decide now.  I realise it's a lot to take in.  I mean, I don't know if that's him.  I'm sorry? This man in the pictures, I'm not sure that's my husband.  That's him, all right.  Look, you can see his face.  Not clearly.  The lighting isn't very good.  Mrs.  Gerard, I assure you, we're always very careful   This was a mistake.    Mrs.  Gerard     I'm sorry that I wasted your time.  I'll leave a cheque at the front desk.  Is she fucking kidding? That's obviously her husband.  She just didn't want to see it.  People get used to living in denial.  It's just easier, you know? Galuzzo has to be the guy we're looking for.  Why would Galuzzo be such a slob everywhere else but here? That's why the kitchen is so clean: It's a kill room.  Galuzzo wasn't checking my body fat for my own fitness.  He was checking to see if I was fit to have as a main course.  He's definitely a butcher.  But does that make him the Brain Surgeon? Our killer leaves bodies out but Galuzzo keeps his bodies to season and savour.  This brain is completely intact marinating in some sort of garlic sauce.  Galuzzo wouldn't waste brains by sending them to Vogel.  They're a delicacy.  He eats them.  Which means whoever's after us is still out there and he still has the upper hand.  Fuck.  He's wearing Kevlar.  Fuck.  He's wearing Kevlar.  Deb, what are you doing here? I want to make an official statement.  How much have you had to drink? One or two.    Why don't we get some coffee?   I don't want coffee.  I want to confess.  You want to confess to what? I killed LaGuerta.    You what?   I killed LaGuer   Why don't we go someplace quiet where we can talk?   Fuck!   I got you.  Take it easy.  Calm down.  What are you talking about? I told you.  I killed LaGuerta.    That doesn't make any sense.    It does.  On New Year's Eve, I was at Papa's.  I called dispatch to find out where she was going.  They said she was going to the shipping yard where she met Estrada before.  So you feel guilty that you didn't back her up.  I don't feel guilty.  I am guilty.  No, you can't let yourself think that way.  You had no way of knowing   what she was doing there.    I did know.  I killed her.  Deb, Estrada killed LaGuerta.  We both know that.  That's not what happened.  I'll tell you what happened.  I know what happened.  The bullet that killed LaGuerta came from Estrada's gun.  He shot first.  It was a through and through.  Bullet was never recovered.  She shot back.  He went down.  He got one more shot off, and that bullet was traced to Estrada's gun.  They both died at the same time.    That's not true.    It is.  Remember, Dexter walked us through it.  Dexter! Oh, fuck.  Hey.  Oh, God, Joey, you have to believe   Okay, okay.  I believe you.  I believe you.  All right? Okay.  Here, just write down everything you remember from that night, all right?   Okay.    All right.  Good.  Good.    Okay.    I'll be right back with you.  What about Arnold Gordon? Trauma surgeon.  He definitely has the right skill set.  Motive? He always resented that I called him a psychopath and he threatened to hurt me if ever I told anyone that he was.    Morgan.    You need to get down to the station.    I'm a little busy.    Your sister just confessed   to killing LaGuerta.    What? She's drunk, high, fucked up   I put her in a room   so nobody could see her.    Make sure she stays.    I'm on my way.    All right.  Is everything okay? It's Debra.  I need you to come to the station with me.    Has something happened?   Yes.  I can't believe she actually confessed.  I thought I got her to see that she's a good person.  This could have been the only way she could relieve herself of the guilt.  Need you to help get her out of this.  Give your expert opinion that she's having a breakdown.  Are you sure? This could be the best thing for her.  Spending the rest of her life in prison?   That's the last thing Deb needs.    Or the last thing you need.  If Debra goes away, odds are, you'll join her.  Admit it, Dexter.  You're mostly worried about yourself.  That's not true.  I told you, I love her.  Not the same way she loves you.  When Debra killed LaGuerta, it was real, selfless love.  She sacrificed everything she believed in for you.  Can you see that? Your sister needs professional help.  There's nothing more you can do.  Well, I can't just give up on her.  I can't.  Dex, hey.  Dr.  Vogel.  She's an old friend of Deb's and Dad, so I figured she could help.    Is she still in the interrogation room?   Yeah.    Have you told anyone what she said?   Course not.  It's crazy, right? She's going through something.  She's likely suffering from posttraumatic stress disorder   after Captain LaGuerta's death.    She wasn't even there.  One of the most common components is survivor's guilt the belief that she could have somehow prevented what happened.    That's what I was telling her.    Not an uncommon response.  We have to get her out of here.  What the fuck are you doing here? Watch the hallway.  Deb, this is Dr.  Vogel.  She was a friend of Dad's.  You can trust her.  She can help.    Hello, Debra.    I don't give a fuck who you are.  Get the fuck out.  Debra, I know how much pain you must be feeling.  But we need to talk about this before you do something you might regret.  Regret? The thing that I regret happened six months ago.  I'm confessing everything.  I'm telling the whole fucking truth! There's nothing you can do to stop me!   Deb, please, let us     Quinn, let me     That was interesting.    Here.  Hold this.  She passed out.  We must take her home to rest.  Let's get her out of here.  Is she gonna be okay? Absolutely.  There may be some work to do, but I promise Debra's gonna get through this.    Is there anything else you need?   Not right now.  Thanks for calling.  You did the right thing.  What the fuck? Are you sure she'll be all right, with everything she has in her system? Physically, she's fine.  It was a very low dose.  But emotionally This is all my fault.  Go easy on yourself.  I should have listened to you.  I thought I could fix this, but you're right.  I can't.  I don't want to just keep making her worse.  Do you really think you can help her? Yes.  Okay.  Go now.  Let me do what I do.  Wait.  Dexter, what are you doing? She's gonna be pissed when she wakes up   maybe even violent.    I can handle her.  You don't know my sister.  Thanks.  Vogel was right.  I am perfect.  But only at one thing.  You disgusting cannibal.  Consumer of human flesh.  There was a time when I couldn't imagine anyone being what you are and doing what you do.  But now I realise I'm just like you.  I consume everyone I love.      Previous EpisodeNext Episode"

        "script": "Previously on Dexter: I've come to believe that the killer could be one of my former patients.  He sent both packages to you.  He doesn't know how to find me.  Yet.  Well, I need to get to him before he gets to me.  I've got my eye on Joey Quinn.  Quinn? There's no way he can pass that sergeant exam.  He'll pass.  I stuck my neck out on the line for you, and you better not fuck this up.  Lieutenant Morgan? Is there a problem, officer? Well, yes.  You're in a car, drunk, with an open container.  Quinn.  Why did she call you? She's a friend.  I couldn't say no.  Come on, you used to fuck her.  There is nothing going on between me and Deb.  I wanna know if there was anything unusual about my father's death.  He killed himself, Dexter.  Harry walked in on what he created.  And he couldn't live with himself.  Trust me when I say that there's a place in this world for your son.  I told you, you're perfect.  How can you say that when you know what I've done to Deb? Unh! I shot the wrong person in that trailer.  Your sister confessed to killing LaGuerta.  What? I'm telling the whole fucking truth! There's nothing you can do to stop me! I thought I could fix this, but you're right, I can't.  I just keep making her worse.  Do you really think you can help her? Yes.  Stop! Do it, Debra.  Shoot him.  This is not who you are.  You are a good cop.  You're a good person.  You're not like him.  Put him down! It's true.  Everything she said.  You're a good person.  It's okay.  Do what you gotta do.  Dex.  Tell me what you saw.  I don't wanna talk about it.  I brought you here so we can strip away the power this place holds.  Talking's not gonna change anything.  Neither is continuing to repress what happened here.  I'm not repressing shit.  And I don't need you to remind me about what happened here.  You know, Dexter's need to kill was born in a container much like this one.  And he's been trapped inside its walls ever since.  As a psychopath, he will never break free.  But you can, by reliving the events of that night over and over.  I killed him.  I shot Dexter instead of LaGuerta.  That's what I saw.  Unless you're gonna handcuff me, I'd really like to go.  When you shot Dexter, how'd it make you feel? Better.  Worse.  I don't fucking know.  What does it even matter? LaGuerta is still dead.  What else could you have done? Arrest him.  Now your brother's on death row.  We could have run.  Only to be caught.  You go to jail, Dexter gets the death penalty again.  You've become obsessed with the life you've taken.  You've forgotten the life you saved.  Of course you defend him.  You created him.  You're using him to track a serial killer.  This isn't about Dexter or me.  This is about you getting better.  Maybe I don't wanna get better.  I don't believe that.  Why the fuck should I even trust you? Why the motherfuck do you even care? Are you upset? Yes, I am.  Good.  At least you're no longer avoiding your feelings.  We're done for now.  For today.  There are countless ways to inflict physical trauma on the human body, and sometimes the deadliest wounds are the ones we barely see.  They run deep, like the ones I've inflicted on Deb.  What are we looking at? Well, most of the blows are to her face.  There's some bruising around the neck.  It doesn't look like there was a struggle.  No signs of a break in.  Yeah, given the lack of defensive wounds and the close proximity of her attacker, I'd say you're looking for someone she knew.  We have a name? Norma Rivera.  Landlord said she lived here by herself.  Got off the phone with the employer.  Housekeeper in Biscayne Bay.  Nice zip code.  Yeah.  Um, they said she had an ex in and out of her life, Roberto Sagastume.  Me and Miller can swing by his place.  He had a record.  It's good to see you taking initiative, like any good sergeant should.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Yo.  You got my test back? You nailed it, bro.  Oh.  Wipe that grin off your face before Miller sees it.  Yeah, I've just never been this happy to get back a positive test, you know? What does my sister see in you? Before I forget there was this hottie asking for you at the station.  And you seem surprised, why? Said she'd come by later.  They always come back for more.  Hey.  Any word on Deb? Yeah, Dr.  Vogel says she's still day to day.  Let her know I was thinking about her.  I will.  She's gonna be okay.  Opening shop.  A run.  Caffeine.  All morning routines.  But lately, mine consists of coming here, waiting for the woman I left my sister with to do what I couldn't, make Deb whole again.  Thank you.  How is she? Well, you still remain the focal point of your sister's pain.  I wanna see her.  I think it's better you keep your distance for now.  It's been almost a week.  Dexter, I am still not sure if your sister has hit rock bottom yet.  What is it? I just want you to prepare for the possibility that Debra may never be able to have you back in her life.  No.  I won't just let her go.  So have you had better luck with our killer? I crossed off three more former patients from your book.  Who's next on the list? Chapter seven.  A. J.  Yates.  I'll check back in once I check him out.  A. J.  Yates.  According to Vogel's book, he attacked a classmate with a chair at 12.  Institutionalised at 15.  Seems Vogel tried to channel his violent tendencies but he was beyond her help.  Eventually, he was transferred to another hospital.  Now Yates seems to be a productive member of society.  He's a bundler.  Cable, phone, Internet.  But I need to know if murder is part of the package.  There's nothing here.  Nothing in Vogel's notes about brain surgery.  His scar.  Is that the mark of one of her unconventional methods? Thanks for letting me use the treadmill.  Better you than me.  I'm not much for running in place.  Is that your shrink way of saying that I have been? Is it? Care for some tea? How about something stronger? Come on, I just ran four miles.  What's one beer? The drinks and the drugs were keeping you numb, making the symptoms of your PTSD worse.  Ass off the table.  How long are you expecting me to stay here? I see a lot of your father in you.  Harry wrestled with the same doubts regarding Dexter.  You're not as alone as you might think.  Honestly, I don't see what the problem is.  He had everything laid out on his bedroom floor.  Dexter saw in the paper how this guy got off on a technicality so he was stalking him, vetting him.  Even found a kill room in an abandoned house near the park.  Just how we taught him.  What did you tell Dexter? That this guy was too high profile, he'd be missed, and that Dexter would have to wait.  He went along with my decision.  For now.  Is this ever gonna be right? What we've done? I mean, Dexter isn't a kid anymore.  He's becoming a man.  He's gonna kill.  We knew that day was coming.  But what happens when I finally tell him it's okay? When he finally knows what it's like to take another person's life? The code will do what it was designed to do.  Allow Dexter to be who he was meant to be.  But what if it doesn't? What if the code doesn't keep him in check? What then? What if this has all been some horrible mistake? Obviously, Harry came around when he realised what else could he have done? Locked Dexter away in an institution? Or do nothing until he took an innocent life? Or protect your brother, giving him the tools that he would need to channel his urges.  The same way you protected Dexter in that container.  It's not the same.  You're wrong.  Deb.  I can't just accept it.  I'm not like him.  I'm not like you.  Dexter   Dex   Dexter is fucking Dexter.  Debra, Harry did not make a mistake saving Dexter's life, and neither did you.  That night in the container Dexter was being exactly who he was meant to be and so were you, the loving sister.  I   Will get through this.  Can I keep that tape? Yes.  He had everything laid out on his bedroom floor.  Dexter saw in the paper how this guy got off on a technicality Dexter, you shouldn't be here.  I was vetting Yates.  What did you do to him? What are you on about? He has a scar on his head exactly where your killer has been harvesting brain fragments.  Is he another one of your little experiments? We can talk about this, but not here.  Not with Debra in the other room.  An x ray revealed a lesion on Yates' brain.  I suspected it was contributing to his violent behaviour, so I I suggested the new hospital remove it.  I never knew whether they performed the surgery.  When I do what I do, I have to know everything.  Sorry for the oversight.  Why don't you tell me the real reason you're here? You could have just called for the scar.  Is it regarding what I said about letting your sister go? Dexter, I assure you that I'm not judging your relationship with Debra.  I'm just trying to manage your expectations.  Why, because she thinks I'm a monster? You think I don't know that I'm the one responsible for the pain she's in? That's why she's here with you.  You have to get her to forgive me.  Whatever it takes, you have to find a way.  I need her in my life.  You need her? Yes.  I understand that you love Debra in your own way.  In my own way.  But why do you think you need her? I just do.  Deb looks up to you.  Isn't that what you said? She used to.  And that made you feel good? Yes.  Well, no wonder you feel so lost.  Debra became a mirror, reflecting a positive image of yourself that you used to balance out with the notion of yourself as a monster.  Now that mirror is cracked, and the only reflection you see is one of darkness.  You make it sound like that part of me isn't real.  You are no monster.  You never have been.  Anyone on my table would disagree.  Dexter, a monster, by definition, is outside of nature.  You're a part of the natural order of things, with purpose and value, a right to exist.  When you accept that, you'll no longer be dependent on Debra, or anyone's, validation.  I'll still want her in my life.  Want, but not need.  No van.  No Yates.  No one home.  \"Monterey Nursing Home.  Dad's 76th birthday. \" It seems Yates found a way to keep his family in his life.  Will I be able to do the same with Deb? Vogel says I don't need her.  But if that's true, will I be able to let her go if that's what she needs? Women's shoes.    Hello?   It's me.  I'm at Yates' house.  Have you found something? Women's shoes.  Individual shoes, not pairs, some of them older.  High heels are a far cry from brains.  It's not exactly your killer's usual MO.  When this began, I expressed my doubts that this was the work of someone new to killing.  Albert wouldn't be the first to alter his methods.  Yeah, still, something about it doesn't quite add up.  But just to be safe, I'm pulling prints off the shoes.  I'll run them through the station's database for missing persons and homicide victims.  But they're only partials.  I won't expect anything back until the morning.  And I have my son tonight.  Understood.  I'll let you know what I find.  Vogel.  She found herself a hero.  Hi.  Hello.  You must be Dexter.  I'm Cassie, 4 B.  And you're in my kitchen because? I'm a friend of Jamie's.  I ran out of detergent.  Daddy! I see you two have met.  I hope you don't mind.  Who am I to deny a neighbour clean clothes? Dinner's in the oven.  I'll see you in the morning? Sure.  I'll walk you out.  Mmm! Nice to meet you, Dexter.  You too.  Bye.  She's nice.  But does she have a kissy neck? I knew you'd pass.  I didn't.  Oh, thank you for that.  This one used to have to write the combination of his locker on his wrist when he first got here.  So what? My memory sucks.  You needed the right encouragement.  I don't even wanna know what that means.  We're empty.  You know, I really am so proud of you.  I couldn't have done it without you.  Who was behind the wheel? Debra Morgan, former lieutenant of Homicide, passed out, piss drunk.  Ha, ha, ha! Come on, let it go.  I don't know who was fucked up more, her or the parking metre she ran over.  Hey.  How about professional discretion? Yeah, well, I believe that we're off the clock.  But you could lower your voice, you know? Yeah, sure.  No problem.  Thanks.  Who was that guy? I don't know.  He used to bone her or something.  Probably the way Morgan made lieutenant, on her back.  Fuck.  Hey, hey, hey! That's enough.  Enough, I said! Enough! What the hell happened? Someone was defending his ex girlfriend's honour.  Get him out of here.  You know what? It's fine.  Let's just go.  I'm sorry.  Hey, how about a round on the house? All right, lieutenant.  Fuck.  So we're good? Mm.  Aah! Babe.  Babe, my ribs.  Yeah? I'm so sorry.  How many, mister? Two.  One for me and one for Dan.  Two it is.  Sorry I'm late.  Who's Dan? Pet elephant.  You don't see him? You want some pancakes, Dan? Eat up.  Make sure Dan doesn't get any syrup on the couch.  Okay.  My car died.  That \"check engine\" light I kept ignoring? Apparently it means what it says.  How'd you get here? Angel.  But don't worry, my car will only be in the shop for a few days.  I'm gonna see if Cassie can give us a lift to Harrison's preschool.  You know, you made quite an impression on her last night.  Impression? She's single.  Just saying.  Hey, why don't you take the SUV? It's safer.  I'll clear my stuff out.  If you can drop me off, I'll pick up a car from the motor pool.  Sure you don't mind? I don't if Dan doesn't.  How did I let you talk me into this again? I believe your price was one beer.  So now what? You tell me.  Isn't this where you think you belong? No.  Frankly, I'm quite amazed that you think you ever left.  Are we really gonna do this? Debra, you shut yourself inside these walls for the last six months doing your damnedest to shut everything and everyone out.  So why don't we? What the fuck are you doing? I want you to convince me how killing Dexter instead of LaGuerta would be a better choice.  Open the fucking door.  LaGuerta.  She was on her knees, where those blood stains are, isn't that right? She was your co worker, your friend.  Why didn't you just stay at the party and let Dexter take care of everything? I had to stop him.  But Dexter can't help what he is.  He has no conscience, unlike you.  You knew the moment you pointed that gun at LaGuerta it was wrong, and still, you pulled the trigger.  You shot a woman in cold blood.  You let her bleed out and did nothing.  You shot an innocent woman for simply doing her job.  Because of Dexter.  And that's what terrifies you the most.  You so desperately want to believe that if you had just shot Dexter, then you wouldn't have to face the truth, that if you had to do it all over again you'd still choose him.  Because in your heart, you know you'll always choose Dexter.  How do I make it right? By finally accepting that you're a good person who was forced to do a terrible thing.  And that you made the best of an impossible situation.  You can walk out that door.  You can move forward.  The choice is yours.  It always has been.  Oh, lieutenant.  A word? Of course.  I was just reviewing the sergeant's exam results.  And it seems you were right and I was wrong about Quinn.  Apparently, he can count past his fingers and toes.  He was in the 85th percentile.  So was Miller.  In the 88th percentile, to be exact.  I want you to strongly consider making her sergeant.  Angie is good.  I like her, a lot.  But I still think Quinn's the smarter   All I said was \"strongly consider. \" This is your first departmental promotion as lieutenant and will reflect on your command.  That being said it's your decision and yours alone.  Three hits off the partials, all reported missing.  Janet Thorton, taken two weeks ago.  Looks like Yates killed these women, but I still can't be sure he's the one after Vogel.  Not until he's on my table and we have a little talk first.  Where are we on Norma Rivera? We're trying to find   Miller.  Address for the ex is no good.  Nobody's seen him.  Got back the ME's report.  They found semen.  I'm testing it to see if it's a match.  Would explain why he's off the grid.  She invites him over.  Things get heated, he kills her, panics and goes on the run.  That's one theory.  Find this guy.  We're on it.  Dex pos\u00c3\u00a9.  Favour.  I need you to stay away from the lab for a bit.  That hottie who's been looking for me is coming and we might need alone time.  No problem.  You would know all about that.    You're better than that.  Come on, here.  There's a 20 in it for anyone who directs her to my lab and is cool about it.  Done.  Okay.  I'm on my own.  Perfect.  Angel.  I get it, okay? You're pissed about last night.  I had to run a tab so that asshole patrolman wouldn't press charges.  If Matthews caught wind of this, he'd have all the ammo he needed to shoot down this promotion.  I lost my cool.  I need my sergeant to be able to keep his.  A bar fight? Technically, the place is a restaurant.  It's not like you haven't done the same.  You put a guy in the hospital for running his mouth about LaGuerta using hers.  Allegedly.  And the difference is, I wasn't up for promotion.  I had already made sergeant.  You wanna fix this? Solve this case.  Excuse me? Are you Vincent Masuka? The one, the only.  But you can call me Vince.  Just as long as you call.  Okay.  I'm Niki.  I'm a student at U of M.  Oh, yeah.  My alma mater.  Come in.  You must be majoring in beautiful.  This is really hard.  I know the feeling.  I think you may be my father.  You were a sperm donor in college, right? Mm hm.  But you have curls.  Yeah, my mom.  Holy Oh, fuck.  This was a bad idea.  Sorry.  I'm sorry.  It's okay.  No, don't worry.  It's okay, don't   Don't   Don't   It's okay.  Don't worry about it.  Oh, my God.  You've got my soulful, yet haunting eyes.  Night, Marty.  See you tomorrow.  We do have filing cabinets, you know.  This is kind of my process.  What are you even doing here? I thought you were taking time off.  Turns out time off isn't all it's cracked up to be.  Heh.  I just wanted to get a head start on some of the cases that you left for me.  Well, we're gonna need food.  \"We\"? Yeah, we.  You look like you could use a hand, and I'm starving.  You know, when I need a break, I've got maybe two days at the most.  And then I go crazy.  I end up right back here.  What about you? What makes you crazy? Family shit.  Hm.  Nothing says family like love and shit.  Unfortunately, my father was an expert in the latter.  Texas oil.  Texas oil? Mm.  Fuck, I hope I'm holding my plastic fork correctly.  Exactly.  He was all rules, all the time.  My moving to Miami to be a cop, that was the biggest \"fuck you\" I could think of at the time.  When I got out of the academy, I realised it was nothing but rules.  Everybody there was like your father.  You know the worst part? I knew I'd made a huge fucking mistake, but there was no way in hell I was gonna give him the smug pleasure of knowing he was right.  So I waited until he died, quit the force.  I opened up this place.  Looks like you're doing pretty well for yourself.  Trust me, I'm still the black sheep.  The look on my mother's face every time she goes into the country club, has to explain to one of her friends that her son is a PI? That's gotta be pretty close to priceless.  Mm.  My dad was everything to me.  I loved him.  And while he's not the man I thought he was well, I'm I'm realising we're more alike than I thought.  To dead dads.  Long may they haunt us.  Heh.  It's a better toast if you open it.  I'm good.  Vogel says I'm not a monster, but that's exactly the part of me she's expecting to remove Yates as a threat.  A threat that seems to have left in a hurry and taken all his shoes.  Does this prove Yates is who I'm looking for? The only way to know for sure is find where he's hiding.  He saw me here, heard everything.  Bone saw.  Specimen jars.  His own cut by numbers guide.  Yates is the brain surgeon.  Vogel needs to know.  I know her.  I pulled her print.  Yates must have stabbed her, nicked her left pulmonary artery, left her for dead.  Unaware cramming her inside that cart would put pressure on the wound and stop it from bleeding.  Now I have to do the same.  It'll hold, but not for long.  Do you think the girl will be all right? She lost a lot of blood.  I stemmed the bleeding, dropped her in the ER, got back as fast as I could.  Oh, God, has he been doing all this because of me? We can't know until we find him.  Let's hope there's something on here that'll tell me how.  These are patient files.  Your patient files.  That's not possible.  This one's dated just two weeks ago.  Dexter, don't.  What is this? You were keeping notes on me? It's a journal.  I've always had a journal.  You were writing down everything we did, everything we talked about.  I never used your name.  Yates, nor anyone else could possibly know who you are.  \"Somehow, he's deluded himself into thinking his feelings for his sister are genuine, unaware there are no real emotions behind them. \" Dexter, I   I never meant   What am I, a subject for another one of your books? Is that what these are for? Answer the question! My notes, it's how I process   You were experimenting on me with Harry and you still are.  I'm nothing but a lab rat, just like Yates.  That's not true.  You know that.  Is that why you wanna keep me apart from Deb? Just another way to isolate your subject, see what he'll do? Dexter Don't.  When Yates is dead, you are out of my life.  It's over.  You understand? Or do you need to write it down? I understand.  I walked into the room and     Go on, tell me.    The blood.  Evelyn, there was so much blood, on plastic.  Dexter had placed it everywhere.  The walls, the ceiling.  There was a table in the middle of the room.  A table with     The body?   Parts of one.  And when Dexter turned, the look on his face   He was so proud.  When   The man Dexter killed, he was a drug dealer.  He murdered your partner.  He was going to get away with it.  But he was a person.  Who, according to the code, deserved   No one deserves to be in pieces.  In bags.  The code is a theory, an idea.  But what I saw, what Dexter did   What we did! I don't think I can live with this.  Fuck, and I'm supposed to? Hello? Mr.  Yates? Yeah, that's me.  I'm afraid we have some bad news.  Your father's heart is failing.  How bad is it? You should come quickly.  He might not have much time.  Dad.  I got here as fast as I could.  I'm right here.  Can you hear me? It was you? I was counting on you being the good son.  They'll be here any second.  Room 26, code blue! We're losing him.  We're losing him! To save his own life, Yates was willing to take his father's.  Vogel believes I'm just like all her other experiments, a psychopath who can't form real connections.  But she's wrong.  Deb isn't a prop, like Yates' father was to his son.  She's more than a mirror.  She's family.  If I have a purpose and value and a right to exist, so do my feelings for Deb.  This experiment is over.  Vogel can go to hell.  Jamie packing you lunch these days? It's for you.  Just came back from Good Samaritan.  Run the blood on the clothes of a stabbing victim, Janet Thorton.  She still alive? Still in surgery.  The son of a bitch who stabbed her broke all of her toes.  How soon do you need this? Very.  On my way to the hospital to get a statement, soon as docs say she's out of the woods.  Let me know what comes back on those clothes.  Will do.  Deb.  What the fuck? Hey.  Hey.  You here to see Dex? Yeah.  Everything okay? Because last time I saw you   Yeah, I am sorry about that.  I'm so sorry I put you in that position.  Sorry I got mad at you for calling Dex.  No, it's okay.  You asked me not to.  I was in a really bad place, but, you know, you were just looking out for me, like you always do.  Things are so easy with you.  I wish it was like that with Jamie.  I just keep getting tripped up, you know? You all all right? Um, she's jealous.  She thinks there's still something between us.  Make it work with Jamie.  Heh.  I want you happy.  You mean so much to me, Joey.  Don't you fucking forget that.  Thanks.  You sure you're okay? I gotta go.  Bye, Joey.  Deb.  The body forms scar tissue to close a wound.  Has my sister begun to do the same? Eventually, scars fade.  Who knows? With enough time, you may not even remember how you got them.  Dex.  Hey, Deb.  What's up? We should talk.  It's important.  Yates can wait.  My sister can't.  Sure, I'd like that.  Just not here.  Can we take a ride? It's good to see you.  Vogel said it was best I stay away.  What the fuck does she know? If it's any comfort, we're not on the best of terms anymore.  She doesn't understand us, Dexter.  Exactly.  She said I might lose you, but we'll always be together, right? Vogel had these DVDs of her and Dad.  Did she ever show them to you? A couple.  You? There was one that was really interesting.  It was, uh, just before Dad died.  It was his last session with her.  Did Dad kill himself? Yeah.  A few years back, Matthews told me the truth.  Harry OD'd on his heart medication.  Was it because of you? He thought he'd created a monster.  I think I know how he felt.  Why he killed himself.  But he only got it half right.      Previous EpisodeNext Episode"

        "script": "Previously on Dexter: What did you do to Yates? He has a scar exactly where your killer has been harvesting brain fragments.  High heels are a far cry from brains.  It's not exactly your killer's usual MO.  Albert wouldn't be the first to alter his methods.  She's found herself a hero.  I know her.  Janet Thorton.  Think the girl will be all right? I stemmed the bleeding, dropped her off in front of the ER.  Patient files.  Your patient files.  Dexter, don't.  \"Somehow he's deluded himself into thinking his feelings for his sister are genuine. \" You're trying to keep me from Deb.  It's another way to isolate your subject.  See what he'll do.  When Yates is dead, you are out of my life.  You understand? What about you? What makes you crazy? Family shit.  Nothing says family like shit.  I see a lot of your father in you.  Harry wrestled with the same doubts regarding Dexter.  The code is a theory.  What Dexter did   What we did   I don't think I can live with this.  Did Dad kill himself? He OD'd on his heart medication.  He thought he'd created a monster.  I think I know how he felt.  But he only got it half right.  Well, we're never gonna get anywhere unless one of you starts talking.  Okay.  Debra, it seems that you tried to kill Dexter as well as yourself.  Yes, but then I saved him.  You saved me? You only had to save me because you tried to kill me.  I know, but   You almost left my son an orphan.  Harrison.  Who's gonna take care of him? Who? I don't know.  All I've done my whole life is try to take care of you, to protect you.  Protect? Jesus Christ.  If this is your way of protecting me   Okay, so I'm not perfect! You think it's easy being your brother? You're not even listening to me.  You don't understand.  I've been trapped in a fucking fog   No, I don't understand.  Haven't you heard anything she said? I'm stupid that way.  My brain is limited.  So when my sister tries to kill me, for some reason, it doesn't make sense.  It's true, Dexter, what she said.  While in the throes of PTSD, one's thinking becomes cloudy.  The weight of what she has been through has been too much for her to bear.  Debra has been in such a turmoil that she sought out the first solution that presented itself.  I had just found out that Dad killed himself because of you.  Because of what you are.  I was fucking traumatised by all this shit.  Yeah, so try to kill us both.  That solves everything.  You are overlooking an important part of what happened, Dexter.  Yes, she tried to kill you, the both of you.  And that was Debra hitting rock bottom.  But ultimately, as she said, she saved you.  And that was Debra's first step toward recovery.  You should see that as a promising sign for your sister.  Great.  I'm so fucking happy for you.  I was trying to catch a serial killer before you tried to drown me.  I think I'm gonna get back to that.  Which, to you, is all I'm good for.  Don't, Dexter.  To hell with both of you.  Don't forget to write all this down.  I've never seen him so mad.  That wasn't just anger.  Fuck, it wasn't? No.  Underneath all that is hurt.  Dexter is deeply hurt by what you did.  Well, that makes two of us.  Family therapy.  Who needs it? Family.  A burden.  They interfere.  They annoy.  Daddy, I wanna watch cartoons.  They interrupt.  You need to get ready for school.  I wanna watch cartoons.  School.  Yates could be anywhere now.  He could've left Miami.  Dexter, do you have any plans for tonight? Um Not sure.  Dexter Morgan.  Please leave a message.  It's me.  Can we talk? Fuck.  Harrison, apple or banana? Banana.  I was thinking of having Cassie over for dinner.  Okay, go ahead.  I mean here.  Why? I think you'd hit it off.  Five minutes of cartoons.  No minutes of cartoons.  You need to get dressed.  So is that a yes? Is what a yes? Dinner tonight.  Two minutes of cartoons? This is not a negotiation.  Now.  Eight o'clock? Please, please, please? Yeah, fine.  Harrison, last warning.  I gotta go.  Okay, bye.  This is one of the first days I'm glad Deb isn't here.  I can lock myself in the lab, don't have to listen to anyone's voice but my own.  We gotta go to the briefing room.  Now? Now would be good.  Probably wondering why I'm smiling.  I'm never wondering why you're smiling.  I've just confirmed that I have a daughter.  Someone let you impregnate them? Made a donation to a sperm bank 20 years ago.  You're not saying there's a female version of you? You met her.  Niki.  The one you showed in.  That chick in your lab? No way.  Yes way.  That beautiful girl came from you? Yes, indeed.  Are you sure she's yours? Who you talking to here? She came in with the paperwork.  I pulled a piece of her hair.  I just finished testing it.  She's a Masuka, through and through.  That poor sweet child.  So you and me, Dex, both dads.  How about that? Great news, Vince.  You know, I'm sure it's all fine, but just be careful, you know? Family showing up like that, out of nowhere? Hey, what do you mean? Sometimes it's just because they want something, you know? Money, a place to stay, a fucking kidney.  Or they wanna kill you.  Lieutenant Batista is currently with Janet Thorton, the, uh, stabbing victim who was dropped at the hospital.  She came to and is ready to make a statement.  She survived.  One less trophy for Yates.  So I'm running the briefing.  The Norma Rivera case.  The victim had sex with someone before she was killed.  We're following the theory that whoever she had sex with is her killer.  Were you able to identify anyone via the semen? Uh, no matches in any of the criminal databases.  Whoever had relations with Ms.  Rivera has never been arrested.  ME's report showed no defensive wounds? Correct.  It's most likely not a rape.  She was probably friendly with whoever killed her.  What about the ex boyfriend? No, we ruled him out.  He's been locked up in Orlando for the week on assault charge.  We questioned the staff of Ms.  Rivera's former employers.  They led us to believe she'd been having an affair with the boss, Ed Hamilton.  When we tried to speak to him, he lawyered up immediately.  So we got a court order to compel a DNA sample from him, see if Hamilton was Rivera's last visitor.  You think Hamilton killed Norma to cover up their affair? We're looking into it.  Old, rich men don't like having their dirty laundry aired, especially when it's the maid.  Dexter, I'm gonna need you to join me and Miller in paying Hamilton a visit.  Janet Thorton gave us the name of her abductor.  Albert Yates.  We got a home address.  I'm grabbing some unis now and heading over there.  You won't find him home.  All right, let's get moving.  Lieutenant, got a minute? Yeah.  You had Quinn run the briefing.  Yeah, how'd he do? He was fine.  Really? Good.  Is he your choice for sergeant? I haven't yet made that decision.  I used to run the morning briefings back in the Gang Unit.  I'm ready to take on more responsibility.  Good to know.  Thanks.  I just wanna make sure you're aware that the Hamiltons are good friends to Miami Metro.  Sure.  Be respectful.  Any of Mr.  Hamilton's indiscretions should take a back seat to solving Ms.  Rivera's murder.  I understand.  Good.  We're here for Mr.  Hamilton.  Mr.  Hamilton.  Mm hm? These police officers are here to see you.  Thank you, Claudia.  My lawyer made it clear I wouldn't be speaking to you.  You don't have to say a word.  We're just here for a cheek swab.  A what? It's a DNA sample.  We have a warrant.  Failure to cooperate will give us no choice but to arrest you.  Why do you need DNA? Ms.  Rivera's autopsy revealed she recently had sexual relations.  My forensics partner is here to see if it was with you.  Wait, wait.  There's no need for a test.  Norma and I were having an affair.  My wife found out and insisted she be dismissed.  A scorned spouse.  Was it the wife?   So your wife knew?   Just how upset was she? No.  My wife's been in Atlanta visiting her sister for the past two weeks.  Which is giving you time to visit Ms.  Rivera.  No.  Yes.  I mean, I didn't visit her.  She came by here to pick up a few things she left behind and one thing led to another, and, uh we did have sex that day.  But she left here alive.  You, uh, didn't visit her apartment later that day, did you? I was here all day.  The Hamiltons' son.  Can anyone corroborate that? Dad? Dad, what's going on? Go inside.  You want me to call someone? I don't want anything.  Go inside.  All right.  Sorry about that.  Where were we? You were saying you have proof that Ms.  Rivera left the premises.  My security cameras.  You'll see Norma arrive and leave through the main gate, alone.  I never, ever would hurt Norma.  I loved her.  But does he love his son? It's Deb.  Hello   Damn it.  Hey.  Hey.  So you're, like, what, the DNA guy? I'm a forensic technician, specialising in blood spatter analysis.  Whoa.  So did you go to the place where Norma Rivera was killed? I did.  And what did you see in, you know, your analysis? She was beaten to death.  Confidential, huh? Well, for what it's worth, you're wasting your time investigating my dad.  He's an asshole, but not a killer.  That's quite a testament.  In my family, it's about as good as it gets.  One more happy family.  Try and get away, and I'll kill you.  You've reached Dr.  Evelyn Vogel.  I'm not available at this time.  Please leave a message.  Dr.  Vogel, it's Debra.  I'm   I need to talk to you, so I'm gonna come by.  Dr.  Vogel? Fuck.  Graves marked by rosebushes.  Yates' previous victims.  He liked to keep them close.  Three bodies so far.  A rosebush planted on top of each.  You think there are three more? Count on it.  The sick bastard turned his basement into a torture room.  Yo, Dex, check this out.  All of his victims have broken phalanges.  And it looks like the bones were broken in sequence, not all at once.  Look.  This bone here had begun the process of mending.  So he kept them there in that room for what, weeks? Looks like it.  He broke each of their toes until he was done, then   Finished them off with a single stab to the chest.  We think this was one of his first victims.  We believe it's Kendall Jaynes, been missing since 2008.  He buries the victims' purses and IDs with the bodies.  And, get this, with each one, the left shoe.  I mean, heh, I like feet, but this is just cray cray.  Deb.  Looking to get your old job back? We could use you.  We have six bodies.  I need to talk to Dexter.  Dex.  Thanks.  Deb, this isn't   It's an emergency.  Vogel's been taken.  What do you mean? I went to her house.  Someone had smashed the window.  She's gone.  Have you called her? A fucking dozen times, no answer.  It's Yates.  He's still in Miami.  I should've killed him already.  I wanna help.  No.  Dexter   You tried helping, it didn't work out.  That was about killing.  This is about saving.  It's dangerous.  I fucking know it's dangerous.  Vogel's life is at stake.  You can hate me, but can we just set that aside until we know that she's okay? I don't hate you.  Why'd you save me? Why didn't you let me drown? I saw the car going underwater.  I knew you were gonna die.  I couldn't imagine my life without you in it.  So now what? Everything just goes back to normal? It was never normal.  I need to do this.  I really need to help.  We need to find Vogel.  We should bring the police in on this.  They're already doing everything they can to find Yates.  This is his work log.  These are all the houses he's worked in, some of which might be empty during the summer.  That's the perfect place to go with a hostage.  That is a lot of places to search, Dexter.  We need Metro's help.  They'll be helping us.  They just won't know it.  Just plot those places out on a map.  Don't do anything on your own.  You still don't trust me, do you? I don't want you hurt.  So who's the guy? What guy? A. J. , this is very serious, what you're doing.  The guy who broke into my house! He's a friend of mine.  I don't like him in my house going through my things.  No.  I understand.  Good! A. J. , I think I know what this is about.  It's your surgery.  You blame me.  What? This little thing? No! I liked having my skull sawed open and a chunk of my brain carved out.  Who wouldn't? Well, you had a lesion on the limbic area of your brain.  And I thought it was causing your   Your violent episodes.  I was only trying to make you better.  Well, it worked really well, didn't it? You're a hell of a doctor! I only wanted what was best for you.  I still do.  That's why you sent your friend after me.  I asked him to protect me.  I had no choice.  You should've just left me alone.  I will.  I will.  You made your point.  There's no reason for us to go any further.  If you do, you'll be caught and you'll go to jail and   Or worse.  My friend is looking for you.  Ah.  Good! I can't wait till he finds me.  No, no! The way I hear it, the sergeant spot is going to be between you and me.  That so? Not gonna ruin our friendship when one of us gets it and the other doesn't? I didn't know we had a friendship.  Excuse me.  Miami Metro Homicide.  Don't worry, you're not in trouble.  What's your name? Armando.  I'm Quinn.  This is Detective Miller.  There was a murder here a few days ago.  Take a look at this.  We were wondering if you saw that man around this time of day, early afternoon? S\u00c3\u00ad, I saw him.  Can you point him out to me? Uh, this one.  Are you sure? Yes.  He drive a Porsche.  You don't see many Porsches around here.  Would you be willing to give a statement that that's the guy you saw? I can come by later today.  Yeah, that's fine.  Here.  Ask for me at the front desk.  Great.  Wanna get his information? Hey.  Hey, what's up? Just got an eyewitness to place Zach Hamilton at Norma Rivera's around the time of her killing.  The son? I wasn't expecting that.    Me neither.  Hm.  I'll let Matthews know.  He's been all over me about this case.  All right, bye.  All right.  This is awkward, isn't it? Heh, heh.  Ahem.  Uh, why'd you decide to look me up now? Ahem.  Um Well, you know, partly because I moved down here from St.  Augustine for school.  Oh.  And what's the other part? My mom passed recently.  So, um, it's just me now.  Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.  Thanks.  And, uh, your mom never married? No, it was always just the two of us.  So now that she's gone, I guess I've been feeling kind of alone.  Well, I'm glad you reached out.  Me too.  What about you? Are you still single? Yep.  Ahem.  Heh, where do you live? Oh, I've got a house down in Coconut Grove.  Fancy.  Are you, like, Mr.  Rich Guy? Ha, ha.  Well, uh I bet you drive a Ferrari.  Masook, what can I get for you? Hey, Marty, um, just a coffee for me.  And, uh, Niki? Um, can I have a double cappuccino and a blueberry muffin? And a veggie burrito to go, please.  I left my bag in the car.  I'm sorry.  Can you get this one? Yeah, no, no.  Heh, heh.  I'll get the next one.  No problem, my treat.  Thank you.  Yeah.  Oh, hey, uh, can you add, um, cheese to my burrito?   Yeah.    Thank you.  Yates has installed cable and Internet from one end of Miami to the other.  If I only look at homes he worked on in the past two weeks, it'll still take days to figure out which homes are vacant.  If he's even in one of them.  And with Vogel being held by Yates, doing what he does Batista should be done looking into Yates' money trail.  Time to see if Miami Metro can help me narrow this down.  Yeah, I'm on hold.  Come in.  Just checking to see how your end of the hunt's going.  Well, just got his credit history.  He hasn't used his charge cards in the last three days, so that trail is cold.  So he's using cash? Yeah.  He's on the run.  He'd probably have to be withdrawing his funds from his bank or ATM.  I got a judge to expedite a warrant on his accounts.  I'm on hold with the bank.  Thank you for holding.  Withdrawals were in Morningside Park.  Would you like receipts? That would be fine.  Thank you.  Bye.  Thank you.  Good news? Yates hit up an ATM near Morningside Park two times in the last couple of days.  He could be holed up in that area.  We'll get some unis out there.  If he shows his face, we'll get him.  Yeah, we'll get him.  No, it's a clusterfuck.  We had a witness place Zach at the murder scene within the time of her death.  We bring him in, he can't remember anything.  Not unusual for a witness to change his mind.  Someone paid him off.  Rich parents like Zach has, it's not hard to put two and two together.  Hm.  You have any other witnesses that put Zach at the scene? No.  I'll bring that kid in for questioning and get a confession out of him.  Waste of time.  You have nothing to go on.  His lawyers won't let him say a word.  He killed her.  You don't know that.  Your only witness recanted.  You have no case.  Now, look, you find something more concrete, you'll have my full backing.  But until then, leave the kid alone.  No reason to make enemies unless we really have to, especially when there are people trying to move up to sergeant.  Capiche? Yeah.  What exactly are we looking for in the Morningside Park area? We need to start figuring out what kind of buildings these are.  Any apartments or condos or businesses can be scratched off the list.  And why are we? I can't.  I know, got it.  Top secret shit between you and your brother.  Understood.  Look at that, a paying client.  I guess I should go and   Oh, that's a friend of mine.  Good.  Hope he needs a favour.  Masuka, what's up? I pass by here all the time.  I figured I'd finally see where you work.  This is it.  It's nice.  Yeah.  Can we go somewhere more private to talk? Sure.  Okay.  What's up? I wanna hire you to do a background check on someone.  You do background checks all the time.  Why would you waste your money? I know, right.  It's more of a personal situation.  Right.  Who are we stalking? Heh, heh, heh.  It's, uh, a family member.  Ooh, gotta be careful.  Don't always wanna know everything about family.  Yeah, well, I really need this.  All right.  Give me a name.  Niki Walters.  Who is it? A cousin? Daughter.  I know, right? I donated sperm back in college.  I've got a 20 year old daughter.  She just showed up out of the blue.  Wow, that's fucking weird.  I mean, she seems really nice, you know? She's smart.  She's pretty.  Seems normal.  But I keep asking myself, \"What's the catch?\" Maybe she just wants to get to know you.  Maybe.  Or maybe she saw an easy mark to hit up for money.  You really think she's here to rip you off? I don't know what to think.  I've got no family except for my parents.  And they're off, retired, living la vida loca in Tampa.  So it's just me.  And now Niki shows up.  I mean, I like the idea of having a daughter, family, right? But if she's here just for my money I'm sure it's fine.  And either way, it's   It's really nice to have family.  Trust me.  You'll be discreet? I don't want her to know I'm looking into her like this.  She'll never know.    Yes, please.    Oh, yeah.  Hey.  Hey.  You want a beer? You remember Cassie, right? Cassie, yeah.  New neighbour, hi.  Yes, it's good to meet you again.  Jamie, can I talk to you for a sec? Sure.  Joey, keep stirring that.  What are they doing in my apartment? Did you forget we had plans? Plans? Dinner, remember? Right.  I figured we'd make it a double date.  Less awkward this way.  I'm gonna have to reschedule.  Excuse me just a sec.  Joey, keep stirring that.  I'm stirring it! Dexter.  You can't do this.  Do what? I went out of my way to set this up.  I made platanos fritos.  I planned this whole night for you.  I'm sorry, something came up.  No.  No, you do this to me all the time.  And I don't mind, I really don't.  But I invited Cassie and Joey.  You can't be rude to them.  Jamie, really, I have to go.  If you even try to walk out that door, Dexter, I will leave.  You'll be stuck here with Harrison all night long.  Jamie   This is for your own good.  You haven't gone out with anyone since Hannah.  Stay for dinner.  When we're done, I'll stay with Harrison so you can go do whatever you have to do.  Serial killer bested by 100 pound nanny.  Born and raised.  Dexter's lived in Miami his whole life.  I'm gonna get some more wine.  Deb.  I've got 12 potential homes Yates could be using as a hideout.  Shit.  I've got seven.  That's a lot to cover.  Let's go.  I'll call you back in five minutes.    So another S.    Yeah, to you.  Saving Private Ryan.  I love blunt things in my mouth.  Oh, jeez.  Excuse me.  Hey.  Want some help opening the wine? Ah, actually, this is a little embarrassing, but I kind of need to leave.  Oh, work? I get it.  When I worked in finance, I was at it 24/7.  Yeah, 24/7.  But the thing is, Jamie's put a lot of time into this whole thing.  Right, you don't wanna piss off the nanny.  Look, um, go.  I'll take care of Jamie.  We'll be fine.  Maybe we could reschedule? Yeah.  I'd like that.  Perfect.  Okay.  I'm really sorry to be the party pooper but I've got an early morning.  Mind if I call it a night? Yeah, turns out I have to take off too.  Thanks for watching Harrison.  I'm sorry.  I know you went to so much trouble.  What the fuck took you so long? It's a long story.  We have 19 houses we have to look into.  At night? Fuck me.  How are we even gonna see if Vogel and Yates are in a house, if they're even holed up in one of these? What if he's already killed her? He hasn't.  She's fine.  He keeps his women alive for weeks.  We'll find her.  Yeah, we will.  We have to.  I'll pick you up in five minutes.  We'll find her.  Stay still.  Unless you want me to restrain you.  You're not angry with me, A. J.  You're angry with her.  Shut up.  And you have every right to be.  Your mother abused you horribly, beat you.  Probably caused the lesion.  Don't talk about her.  But I understand, A. J.  I understand the terror you felt.  She hit you, slapped you.  You'd find a safe place under the bed.  And she'd look for you, raging.  And you'd curl up under there, looking out, waiting.  She'd pace back and forth in front of the bed.  Yes.  Shoes clacking.  Feel the panic rising.  The pain you knew awaited.  Hm.  Don't say another fucking word.  No, no.  Now, you can take the pain and live a little longer or you can stop struggling, and I'll kill you right now.  Good.  So which little piggy won't be making it to market? Albert, stop it! Don't call me that.  Only my mother called me that.  Stop that, Albert, now.  No.  Don't you talk back to me, you little shit! I'm not afraid of you.  All you ever do is disappoint me.  Enough! Stay.  Don't know this number.  Not this house.  Morgan.  Here.  Let me help you with that cut.  You shouldn't call me Albert.  My name is A. J.  I'm sorry.  It's Vogel.  She's alive.  What? She is with Yates.  She called me.  She left her phone out or something.  Oh, my God.  You're still bleeding.  It's local.  You think Elway can trace this? I don't know.  I can fucking ask him.  Let me take care of you.  Deb, what's up? Look, I don't wanna explain to you why I can't go through the police, and I know it's illegal, but I need you to trace a number for me.  What's the number? You're no different than Mom.  Yes, I am.  I understand.  How long is this gonna take? Fuck if I know.  What if he kills her? I thought you said it takes like a week for him   I know what I said.  It's bullshit.  You're angry.  Let's not think like this.  You had a horrible childhood.  But you don't have to live your life Yeah? One five seven Montgomery.  You're a fucking saint.  Thank you.  One five seven Montgomery.  You know where that is? You shouldn't have hit me.  She hit him? I was scared.  I can still help you.  You don't have to be angry at me.  You can't help me.  I can.  I understand what you've been through.  No child should ever have to hide under a bed from a parent.  You sought connection with her, and all she gave you was pain.  What   What you do for your women, it's a search for that same connection that you never got from your mother.  But what we have here now, in this moment, you and I? This is real human connection.  What you have with your victims, that only pales in comparison.  Do you understand? My poor, poor boy.  All you want is to belong, don't you? I can help you.  I can, trust me.  Oh, what did you do? I didn't.  Who did you call? Is this your friend? Dexter, Dexter! Yeah, you call him.  Fuck you, Dexter! Fuck.  You okay? Yeah.  Oh, fucking Christ.  Are you all right? Yeah, I think so.  Did he hurt you? No.  No.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Where's Yates? Let's get you out of here.  Then we can find Yates.  Debra, are you okay? I'm good.  Really, I'm good.  Let's just get this cleaned up and get out of here.  Brain cores.  I'll dump them with Yates' body.  So this is finally over.  My tormentor is dead.  Thanks to you, Dexter.  And Deb.  Yes.  And Deb.  I'm glad to see that the two of you have managed to find your way back to each other.  Well, the family that kills together You're doing well, Debra.  You're very resilient.  We'll see.  You are.  And you never gave up on her.  I'm impressed.  I know Harry would be too.  He was always concerned that, as you grew older, you might drift apart.  Well, we never really had a choice.  If anyone really knew us, they would run screaming.  This is everything.  Okay.  So is this it? A few days ago, everything seemed hopeless between Deb and me.  But through Dr.  Vogel and Yates, I've got my sister back.  Not like things were before.  It's something different.  But for now, it's enough.  It's beautiful out here, Dexter.  I like it.  It's peaceful, alone on the water.  Tonight, you brought us.  Yes.  Why? I wanted to be with family.      Previous EpisodeNext Episode"

        "script": "Previously on Dexter: Who's the guy that dropped you off? We didn't sleep together.  You are certainly allowed to be a player.  You remember Cassie, right? Yeah.  New neighbour.  Hi.  Hi.  I kind of need to leave.  I'll take care of Jamie.  Maybe we could reschedule? Yeah.  I'd like that.  Any reason why you haven't taken the exam? I got your brother on my ass about taking the sergeant's test   What is so wrong about bettering yourself? You nailed it, bro.  Is he your choice for sergeant? I'm ready for more responsibility.  I want you to strongly consider making her sergeant.  I think you may be my father.  Family showing up out of nowhere? A lot of times, they want something.  I you to do a background check on someone.  You think she's here to rip you off? I don't know.  Norma Rivera.  She'd been having an affair with the boss, Ed Hamilton.  Dad, what's going on? The Hamilton's son.  Did you go to where Norma Rivera was killed? I did.  What did you see in your analysis? Leave the kid alone.  He killed her.  You don't know that.  Your only witness recanted.  No reason to make enemies unless we really have to.  Where's Yates? So this is finally over.  My tormenter's dead.  Thanks to you, Dexter.  And Deb.  I'm glad you found your way back to each other.  Well, the family that kills together A few days ago, everything seemed hopeless between Deb and me.  But through Dr.  Vogel, I've got my sister back.  It's beautiful out here, Dexter.  I wanted to be with family.  Accidents happen, shattering our sense of control, if not our lives.  It's no accident that Zach Hamilton is here.  He's drawn to blood, like me.  Did he kill Norma Rivera? After a week of vetting him, I haven't been able to find definitive proof.  But I'm sure if I keep following him the truth will become clear.  Or it could get murkier.  Dexter.  Have you taken on Zach Hamilton as a patient? It's nice to see you too.  I have to protect you from another murderer? How did he get to you? His father contacted me because of my reputation for working with psychopaths.  He's concerned about his son's behaviour, his propensity for violence.  It's more than a propensity.  I think Zach Hamilton killed Norma Rivera.  And I take it that you followed him here today because you're planning to kill him? The thought had crossed my mind, yes, if I can find solid proof.  Well, then it would seem that we have a conflict of interest.  I don't believe this.  You're going to work with another killer after what happened with Yates? Dexter, I appreciate your concern, but I'm not going to talk about Zach Hamilton with you any further.  It wouldn't be ethical.  Suddenly, you're worried about ethics? I know.  I threw them out the window when I met you because my life was on the line.  Now the threat is over.  You're bringing another threat into your life.  It's my work.  What can I say? I treat dangerous people.  It's a hazard of the job.  Besides, you have no proof that Zach Hamilton is guilty of anything.  I will.  If you do, then come to see me first, before you do anything, and we'll have another conversation.  Would you do me that favour? We'll see.  Maybe this is why she tracked me down, for money.  You don't know that.  I mean, maybe she genuinely wanted to get to know you.  What, at the same time her Hyundai's being repossessed? Has she asked you for money? No.  But she always seems to be missing her purse when the check comes.  I thought we had a real connection.  You like having Niki in your life? I do.  Then why don't you wait it out and see how it plays out? In the meantime, you can enjoy her company.  Okay.  Hm, heh.  Thanks, Deb.  Welcome.  Deb, got a new case.  Let me guess, someone suspects their significant other is fucking around.  Yeah, but this one is a bit different.  How? Because the person is me and the significant other is my sister's ass chasing, shithead boyfriend.  Kevin Wyman, notorious player, frequents a singles bar in a hotel where he keeps a suite.  Have you tried talking to her? Susan doesn't listen to me.  It'd just push her more quickly into his arms.  So that's off the table.  Well, going behind her back seems kind of fucked up.  It's gotta be this way.  I gotta catch this guy in the act.  Okay, but you're doing it by yourself.  I need your help on this, Deb.  It'd be a lot less conspicuous if we work this as a couple.  Well, I'm not sure if I'm comfortable.  Well, are you comfortable getting a pay cheque? Okay, boss.  Thank you.  Where does this piece go? Right here.  Very good.  Dex? Don't forget, my birthday picnic's in a few days, okay? On the beach, outside of Papa's.  Bring Harrison.  Yeah, we'll be there.  Great.  You know who else will be there? Cassie.  I heard you have a date with her.  No, it's not a date.  I felt like I owed her one after we both bailed on your dinner the other night.  Why won't you just admit that you like her and that I am an awesome matchmaker? I admit that you're an awesome nanny.  You'll have to settle for that.  We'll revisit this after the date.  Oh, by the way, the TV remote has been missing since yesterday.  I think somebody hid it but I can't get anything out of him.  Harrison, did you take the TV remote? No.  Do you know where it is? No.  He says he didn't take it.  Right.  Guess I'll just keep looking for it.  Homicide in Liberty City.  It looks like you're gonna have to finish that puzzle on your own.  I'm doing all the work anyway.  Yeah, you are.  Bye.  Bye.  Welcome to spatter land.  Hope you brought extra string.  Never leave home without it.  Good news.  We have the victim's boyfriend in custody.  A witness saw him taking off from the scene, and he forgot to change his bloody socks.  Heh.  God bless stupid killers.  Once again, drawn to blood.  Looks like Zach has just given me the in I need.  Zach Hamilton, right? You were at my house.  That's right.  You guys find out who killed Norma? No luck.  It's a dead end.  You like to shoot crime scenes? Yeah, I got a police scanner app on my phone.  Better than playing video games.  You ever been on the other side of the yellow tape? Nope.  This is as close as I've gotten.  Well, come on.  Are you serious? Yeah, just don't touch anything.  Whoa.  This is amazing.  I remember that feeling.  Awe, wonder.  It only fed the urge.  Hey, can I take some pictures? It's usually against protocol, but what the hell? Go ahead.  Cool.  Thanks.  So, what happened to her? She was stabbed.  Yeah, obviously.  But, like, you know, how? If I open up to him, maybe he'll open up to me.  Come on.  I can handle it.  Well, the victim tried to defend herself.  There were defensive wounds on her body but you can also tell by these big, round drops on the ground.  And this multiple cast off spatter suggests that she was stabbed several times.  And the arterial spurting here indicates that the killer severed her carotid artery with the first stab.  You can tell all that just by looking at the blood? Pretty much.  Awesome.  So I heard you caught the guy who did it.  Yeah, her boyfriend.  How? He was sloppy.  Left a bloody print and DNA.  He was spotted driving away from the scene.  Oh, yeah? What kind of car? Must have heard his Porsche was seen at Norma's apartment.  No one noticed.  So the killer, he should've worn gloves and long sleeves, made sure he was covered up.  He's making this a teaching moment.  Well, yeah, if he was smart.  The kid's a quick study, but that doesn't prove he killed Norma Rivera.  So, hey, I gotta get going, but thanks.  Hey, why don't you give me a call when you print those up? I'd love to take a look.  Yeah.  Yeah, I guess I could do that.  Time to make another connection.  Here you go.  Thank you.  Thank you for doing this with me.  When you own a food truck, you have to scope out the competition.  Plus I just really love to eat.  Yeah, no problem.  I wouldn't miss these peanut butter and Nutella fries for anything.  Mm hm.  So you're indulging me in my favourite pastime.  What do you like to do for fun? You know, normal stuff.  Like what? Um Heh, heh.  I like spending time with my son.  I already know you're a great dad.  What else? I love my job.  But that's work.  What are you passionate about? I like to bowl.  You're passionate about bowling? No.  Heh.  Heh, heh.  Of course not.  I just do it for fun, once in a while.  What about your weekends or your free time? Oh, I have a boat.  Oh, I love to sail.  No, it's a motorboat.  Oh.  You water ski? No.  Race? No.  Do you scuba dive? No.  Heh, heh.  What do you do on your boat? I just Take it out and Turn around and come back.  That's it? That's all I can tell you.  I think we may need some alcohol.  Right.  Dating is harder than I remember.  Oh, this guy is fucking pathetic.  I get that you hate the guy, but looking isn't cheating.  It's a slow night.  Give him a minute.  So you said Susan doesn't listen.  Does that mean you all have a strained relationship? Not from my end, no.  But from hers? Yeah, you know, probably.  I mean, look, I couldn't wait to get away from my old man, and Susan was just a kid.  You know, I should have at least picked up the phone.  But I never did, you know, so Well, you can't undo the past.  And families fuck you up.  That's just the way it is.  I can stop Susan from fucking up her future.  I can do that.  It looks like he's packing it in for the night.  If you wanna catch this guy, why don't I set him up? We can see if he takes the bait.  No, I don't want you doing that.  I worked Vice.  I've done worse than that before.  I just need pictures of him hitting on you.  Certainly nothing more than that.  Are you sure? I mean, I could marry him, maybe pop out a couple of babies.  Let's go.  Dexter, thanks for coming.  Sure.  Couldn't wait to show you these photos.  Yeah, no problem.  It's on my way to work.  Doughnut? Fucking A.  Mm.  Well? He treats the blood like a swimsuit model.  Well, very colourful.  You know, a lot of photographers like to mute down their reds.  You know, find it too distracting, but I like to ride the saturation.  Hm.  You think I overdid it? No way.  These are you.  That's the important thing.  Well, I can work you up some prints, if you want.  I wouldn't have them if it weren't for you.  Actually, I think I have plenty of my own.  Right.  Of course.  I forget it was a crime scene.  Keep thinking that dead chick spilled all that blood just for me.  Who's she? Uh, it's nothing.  Just a lens test.  New 300 millimetre.  Fucking monster.  Wow.  Excuse me.  Yep? Jesus, you still drunk from last night or are you starting a new bender? Yeah, okay.  Yeah, I said okay.  Uh, I gotta go.  Anything wrong? It's fine.  I just gotta go.  Sure, some other time then.  I'll have to find another way to get to him.  Ah, lieutenant.  Tell me something.  Did you decide you don't need a sergeant? Sir? I expected an announcement by now.  What's going on? To tell you the truth, I'm having trouble narrowing down my choice.  I know you want me to pick Miller, and on paper, I can't argue with that.  Scored higher on the test, got the experience, the record   She's African American, a woman.  Here's the thing, Quinn has his attributes too.  Name one.  He's street smart.  Look, I know what's going on here.  What do you mean? You want me to be the bad guy.  You want me to insist that you promote Miller.  That way you can tell Quinn, \"I had no choice. \" I'm not sure that's   You're lieutenant now.  Time to grow a set of balls.  I wanna hear something by the end of the day.  Just like old times, huh? You, me, steak, beer.  Yeah, it's been a while.  So how are things? Good, great.  You? Fine.  Better.  Good.  I'm glad.  Me too.  I think these are done.  Well, how's work? Uh, crazy.  Elway wants to catch his sister's boyfriend fucking around on her, so I offered myself as bait so he'd get it done.  What  ? You did what? I used to do it all the time in Vice.  Yeah, and you hated it.  Why put yourself in that position again? Because he's my boss.  And because I can only take one control freak at a time.  Sorry.  This is tough.  A little.  Not exactly worth living for.  What? You said that once when you tasted one of my steaks, that it was worth living for.  For some reason, I've always remembered that.  It'll get easier, Dex.  We're just getting back in the saddle, you know? Yeah, I think we might be eating a saddle.  Are you still seeing Dr.  Vogel? Yeah, it's too bad for me there's no magic pill to cure PTSD.  Well, as long as she's helping you.  Like, she knows everything about our lives because of Dad, but I know jack shit about her.  Where'd she get that fucking accent? And who the fuck is Rich? Her husband.  She was married? When I first looked into her, I found out some stuff about her background, and she was married to a Dr.  Richard Vogel.  Huh.  Okay, so Harrison's asleep.  And look what I found under his bed.  Ooh, someone's in trouble.  He lied about it.  At least now we know why.  I hope it's under warranty, or I'll be stuck with whatever's on PBS Kids for the foreseeable future.  I'll talk to him.  Okay.  Enjoy your dinner, guys.  Bye.  Should I be worried that Harrison's lying? He's 4, doofus.  Right.  This steak tastes like asshole.  Yeah.  Let's order pizza.  With pineapple, please.  Not on my half.  Sorry, cow.  What's up? I'm promoting Miller to sergeant.  Say that again? I'm giving Miller the job.  I'm sorry.  I just think she's the most qualified candidate.  Are you fucking kidding me? I mean, after all the quizzes, and the speeches about bettering my life? You actually made me want this, and now you're gonna take it away.  Why, because I didn't solve the Rivera case? No, of course not.  It's just a lot of other stuff I can't ignore, man.  The Nadia thing, shooting Novikov.  You know what? Fuck it.  You did what you thought was right.  Leave it at that.  Hey.  I need everything you got on the Norma Rivera case, anything that points to Zach Hamilton.  Uh, well, forensically, there's not much.  There's nothing, actually.  Fuck it.  I'll just tail the little prick 24/7 until I get what I need.  If Quinn's stalking Zach, how can I? Won't even know I'm there till I bust him.  You mind if I come along? You want to come along? Things are slow here.  I'm going a little stir crazy.  Maybe you could use another set of eyes? Sure.  I mean, you think Miller's clean? Come on.  You dig deep enough on anyone in this department and you know what you find? What? The shit.  It's there.  I mean, we all got it.  I know you know what I'm talking about.  Yeah, I can't argue with that.  We've all got the shit.  Yeah.  Big difference is some people get away with theirs and some people don't.  You're a good detective.  It'll work out.  Yeah, I'm just worried about how Jamie's going to take it.  I think she was all excited about me moving up in the world, making something out of my life.  She'll probably break up with my ass now.  Jesus Christ, how many pictures of fucking women in tights does this pervert need? Apparently, a lot.  How's Deb doing? I've been worried about her.  She's good.  She's much better.  You guys work out whatever your issue was? What do you mean? I mean, you guys have been connected at the hip for most of your lives.  All of a sudden, you're not talking, you don't see each other.  Somebody shit in somebody's Cheerios.  Yeah.  Just typical brother and sister stuff.  It's no big deal.  Something had her fucked up.  How weird was it that she confessed to killing LaGuerta? I should have stayed in my office.  What was that about? That's the woman in the photo that Zach didn't want me to see.  And he isn't looking at the class, he's looking at her.  You know what I'm saying? Fortunately, Quinn isn't.  Well, people do weird stuff when they're under a lot of stress.  We may never know what that was all about.  All right, see you guys later.  Looks like they're done.    So is our guy.  Buckle up.  Hey.  Hey.  Wow.  Okay.  Uh What? You look incredible.  Good job.  Well, that's the point.  Don't look so fucking surprised.  Didn't leave me a lot of places to put the transmitter.  Are you bitching? I'm the one helping you, remember? I just don't wanna touch anything I'm not supposed to.  Here.  Thank you.  Mic? There you go.  I'm not looking.  I'm not looking.  Okay.  Okay? Yep.  All right.  Quickly, just say something for me.  You blush like a little girl.  Heh, heh.  Okay, just Just get him alone.  That's all I need, okay? Okay.  Thank you.  I'm really glad we met.  Me too.  You know, I didn't know if I mentioned it, but tonight's kind of a celebration.  Yeah? Closed a huge deal.  Two blocks downtown, prime views of the bay.  It's gonna rent through the roof and I get a big piece of it.  Something tells me you like getting a big piece of everything.  Whenever I can manage.  Congratulations.  Thank you.  I just wish I had a present for you.  What do you say we migrate to my suite? Got a nice little private bar.  It's a lot quieter than this place.  All done here.  You're gonna love the views.  It's beautiful.  Nice, light music.  It'll be real nice.  No, save it for the room.  What, you playing hard to get? I don't kiss in public.  You're bashful.  Mm hm.  Maybe.  Get your fucking hands off of her! Jesus, Elway.  The hell is going on? She's wired, douche bag.  You're done.  You fucking son of a bitch.  You're gonna call Susan tonight.  Tell her it's over.  If you don't, she's getting an e mail.  You got it? You got it? Yeah, I got it.  Good.  You're an asshole.  The fuck are you thinking? I'm sorry, all right? I just   Seeing him paw all over you like that, I don't like that shit.  I'm sorry about your top.  That's okay.  It's all right.  I got it.  Sofia Fuentes, current place of employment: the Cypress Harbour Yacht Club, which is owned by Zach's family.  That's where Zach must have first laid eyes on her.  If Zach takes pictures of his victims before he's killed them, chances are he likes after photos as well.  If he did kill Norma Rivera, then he's got the photos to prove it.  Sofia.  Probably his next victim.  Now I just need to find any photos of Norma Rivera.  Norma Rivera.  Taken seconds after she was killed, the pool of blood around her head growing from one image to the next.  Zach Hamilton, murder weapon in hand.  All the proof I need.  You wanted proof.  There it is.  Zach Hamilton killed Norma Rivera.  Yes.  I know.  You know? Mm.  Zach told me during our first session.  But you didn't tell me because of your sense of ethics? Oh, forget ethics.  Why would I help facilitate the death of someone I see potential in? Potential? He's a killer.  He deserves to die.  Heh, heh.  Isn't that a little intolerant, coming from you? I don't kill innocent people.  But you might have, if it hadn't been for Harry and me.  You could even be on death row right now.  Right.  But you were spared.  Yeah, spared because of the code.  That's an interesting idea.  What do you mean? What if we were to teach Zach the code? You can't be serious.  Why not? It never occurred to me to try again, because I didn't have Harry.  But now I have you.  Maybe it's time to see if the experiment will work.  This isn't a science project.  No, but it's a matter of life and death.  Zach's life is on the line.  What possibly makes you think Zach could be taught the code? I told you, I see something in him.  And it worked with you.  Zach and I are nothing alike.  No, of course not.  You are definitely one of a kind.  He killed an innocent and he's getting ready to do it again.  He needs to die.  Harrison.  I never intended to have a son, but now he's the one thing in my life that seems most right.  There she is! Hi! Yay! Aw.  Mwah.  Happy birthday.  Aw, thanks, Dex.  Thank you.  Can I go play? Yeah, sure.  Have fun.  Stay close, Harrison.  Yeah, I'm   I'm not sure if he's a date or just a friend.  I mean, what I do know is that she's very attractive, and men like her, so if you want a chance, you better move fast.  Right.  I think I'm gonna go grab a beer.  You know, this may sound weird, and I don't mean to sound creepy or anything, but I think I really like you.  Aw, I like you too.  I'm not really ready to call you \"Dad,\" but you're cool.  \"Cool\"? Usually, I'm the only one that calls me that.  So that's awesome.  Oh, hey.  I got you something.  What? It's really not a big deal.  It's not a big deal? You're giving me $5000? Why? Hey, I know you could really use it.  But you should know that that's really all that I can afford.  I don't understand.  How do you know that? Well, you know, I just did a little research on you.  You checked into me? Like a criminal? No, I just wanted to make sure you were who you said you were.  And that I wasn't after you for your money? I just   Look, I have debts, but they're soon to be paid, and that's not really any of your business.  I wouldn't ask you for this.  I'm really sorry.  Do you understand that it was hard for me to do this? To find my father? But I felt like it was worth it to get to know you.  You know, maybe I was wrong.  Here you go.  No, thank you.  Hey, Niki   All right, everyone.  I'd like to make a toast.  To the best kid sister a guy could ever have, Jamie.  Aw.  Aw.  Thank you.  I love you.  Happy birthday.  I love you too.  Aw, thank you, guys.  Thank you so much for coming.  You guys are the best, and it really is so nice to have you all here in one place together.  I love you guys.  Cheers.  Happy birthday.  And here's to you, Sergeant Quinn.  I know it's premature   Way premature.  You didn't tell her? I didn't want to upset her on her birthday.  No.  You didn't get the job? You didn't give it to him? I had to go with the person best for the job.  And how is that not Joey? Hey, it's okay.  He gave the promotion to Miller.  It's, you know But going for sergeant was your idea in the first place.  You set him up.  I didn't mean to.  Jesus, Angel.  Hey.  Dexter, hi.  How are you? I'm great.  You? Great.  Nice party, huh? Yeah.  The beach.  Yeah.  Harrison looks like he's having a really nice time.  Yep.  Uh, Dexter, this is Oliver.  Oliver, Dexter.  Nice to meet you.  Yeah, you too.  I didn't know if you wanted the Belgian brown or the pilsner, so I got you the one with the moose on it.  Can't go wrong with a moose.  Heh, heh, heh.  I'm gonna go check on Harrison.  Okay, take care.    Is that okay?   Yeah, that's great.    That's your neighbour, right?   Yes.  What happened with Susan? Wyman break up with her? Yeah.  Yeah, he did.  So it's a win.  Why do you look like someone just ran over your dog? I just got off the phone with her and she couldn't stop crying.  She thinks it's all her fault, like somehow, she's not good enough or something.  Well, she would've caught him cheating eventually.  The result would have been the same.  Yeah, but it wouldn't be me that made her cry.  Jesus, I just feel like shit.  People can't help sticking their noses in when it's someone they care about.  I know.  I know.  You tried to tell me.  So does that mean you care about me? Only to the extent that you sign my pay cheque.  Touch\u00c3\u00a9.  Okay, what are we gonna read tonight? Let me guess, Wee Monkeys.  Wee Monkeys! Before I read to you, I gotta talk to you about the TV remote.  You said you didn't take it, but Jamie found it under your bed.  I didn't mean to break it.  I was pretending it was a Thunder Blaster and I dropped it in the kitchen.  Well, yeah, that's okay.  Accidents happen.  But you lied to me.  That's a big deal.  We should never lie.  But, Daddy, you lie.  What do you mean? You told me Doggy got lost.  I saw you throw him in the trash.  I had to rescue him.  You're right.  I lied.  Doggy got dirty, and I tried to clean him up, and when I couldn't, I threw him away.  I'm sorry I lied to you, Harrison.  That's okay.  But can I keep him? I really love him.  He's soaked in blood that links me to a murder.  Yeah, but maybe he should live under the bed.  Okay.  Okay.  Wee Monkeys.  Wee Monkeys! It's no accident, Harrison catching me in a lie.  I can live with my lies, but how long can Harrison before he finally sees through? I should be back in a few hours.  Sorry to keep you late on your birthday.  Trust me, it'll probably be the highlight of my day.  Vogel doesn't want me to kill Zach, but she's wrong about him.  He deserves nothing but my table.  He's here.  Hey, Zach, it's Dexter.  Where is he? Why would Zach buy a car for $1200? Because the one mistake he made with Norma Rivera was showing up to kill her in a red Porsche.  He's going to kill Sofia tonight.  Cypress Harbour Yacht Club.  Hi.  Could you tell me if Sofia Fuentes is working tonight? She gets off here in a few minutes.  Thank you.  Zach, waiting to make his move.  And Quinn, still trying to prove he's a good cop.  Hey, Dex.  Hey.  Look, this is probably none of my business, but I feel like I should tell you about Quinn.  Okay.  He thinks you're gonna break up with him.  Break up with him? Why? Because he didn't make sergeant.  That's crazy.  Why would he think that? Maybe you should, um, invite him over.  I think he's feeling pretty down.  Yeah.  Yeah, of course.  Thanks, Dex, for calling.  That really is so sweet of you.  Sure.  Quinn problem solved.  And there's Sofia.  Zach's father.  Sofia is Hamilton's mistress, just like Norma before her.  What is he doing? Hey.  I know what you're doing.  Quinn.  You playing detective? Watching Zach? Yeah, you caught me.  I'm going to see Jamie.  Keep an eye on Zach.  Jesus.  What the fuck? What are you doing? Why were you going to kill your father? What? I wasn't trying to kill my   I know you killed Norma Rivera.  I thought you were going to kill Sofia, but you were going after your father.  Why? You're crazy.  I didn't try and kill my father.  You tell me one more lie, and I'll kill you.  I had to.  Why? Because he's killing my mother.  She's drinking herself to death because of him.  Over the years, one affair after another, and he doesn't even try and hide it.  I thought killing Norma would put an end to it, but two days later, he's banging some hostess from the club.  I knew if I wanted it to stop, I had to kill Dad.  So that's what this is all about, you trying to protect your mother? You actually care about her? Of course I do.  She's my mother.  But showing up at crime scenes, accidents, taking pictures of all the blood.  This is about more than just your mother.  No, I had to protect her.  Yeah, I believe you.  But you killed because you want to kill.  No.  Yes.  To take a living person and make them dead, imagining that you can actually hear the moment when their heart stops beating, smell the blood as it pools across the floor.  I can't help it.  It just builds up inside me all these years.  But Norma was the first time I ever followed through.  And how was it, once you'd killed her? It felt like this huge weight was lifted off my chest, this release of something horrible inside me.  Like you were finally in control.  Yes.  You should just go ahead and kill me.  Why? Because if you don't, I know I'll do it again.  I don't want to be like this, but I can't help it.  I just am.  I'm some kind of freak.  A monster.  Yes.  You haven't told anyone else about this? Besides Dr.  Vogel.  No, I couldn't.  You never had a Harry.  A what? Someone to talk to.  Someone to teach you.  Some things happen to us by accident.  Others are choices.  There are parts of me that I can never share with my own son.  But with Zach, could I teach him? Am I ready for this, to be a spiritual father? So how'd your sting go with Elway? Terribly.  Didn't work out? No, it worked out fine, but   What? He likes me.  Oh.  That's a bad thing? Well, he likes me because he doesn't know a fucking thing about me.  \"Yeah, I killed two people and tried to kill myself and my brother.  But, sorry, what kind of wine would you like to order?\" I mean, what the fuck? Yeah, I kind of know what you mean.  How are things with Cassie? Um I don't think there's much of a future there.  Maybe the Morgans just aren't meant for relationships.  Yeah, maybe not.  But, hey, life is good.  I'm feeling optimistic for the first time in a while.  I'm even thinking about taking on a kind of Intern.  Hm Well, that's a big step for you, right? Letting some novice into your private lab.  Yeah.  Hey, are you okay? I don't feel so good.  What's wrong? I feel kind of dizzy.  Deb? Hello, Dexter.  Remember me?       Previous EpisodeNext Episode"

        "script": "Previously on Dexter: It's no accident that Zach Hamilton is here.  He's drawn to blood, like me.  The arterial spurting here indicates that the killer severed the carotid artery with the first stab.    I'm promoting Miller to sergeant.    Are you fucking kidding me? You actually made me want this, and now you're gonna take it away.  I just did a little research on you.  You checked into me, like a criminal.  Hey, Niki Dexter, this is Oliver.  Oliver, Dexter.    Nice to meet you.    Yeah, you too.  Zach Hamilton killed Norma Rivera.  He deserves to die.  Isn't that a little intolerant coming from you? What if you were to teach Zach the code? Maybe it's time to see if the experiment will work.  What possibly makes you think Zach could be taught the code? I see something in him.  Why were you going to kill your father? Because he's killing my mother.  She's drinking herself to death because of him.  You killed because you want to kill.    You should just go ahead and kill me.    Why? Because if you don't, then I will do it again.  I can't help it.  Am I ready to be a spiritual father? Hey, you okay?   I don't feel so good.    Deb? Hello, Dexter.  Remember me?   Hello?   Dexter? I was just about to leave you another message.  Where have you been all morning? The last thing I remember is Hannah.  Is everything all right? Not if Hannah got to Deb.  I can't really talk now.  I just thought you should know that Zach Hamilton called.  I'm so glad you decided not to kill him, Dexter.  I have to go.  Deb, are you okay? Dex, where the fuck are you? Just a sec.  I'm outside of Kendall.  Are you alone? Why wouldn't I be? Why are you on the other side of town? I need you to come pick me up.  Are you okay to drive? I think so.  I mean, who the fuck knows? I woke up on the floor feeling like shit.  You were gone.  What the fuck is happening? Just come pick me up.  I'll text you the location.  We'll talk when you get here.  Hannah drugged us left me stranded in the middle of nowhere.  If she's come back because she wants one or both of us dead then why are we both still here?   It was Hannah, wasn't it?   It was.  I saw her before I blacked out, and then I woke up here.  She must have drugged our food.  If Hannah poisoned us, why didn't she kill us? Who the fuck knows, Dexter? Maybe we were supposed to eat more.  Or she wants to let us know she's out there.  Maybe this was just the beginning.  If we were normal people, we would go to the U. S.  Marshals Service.  We can't do that.  She knows everything about me.  She didn't talk about you last time she was arrested.  Because she was in love with me.  Drugging me and leaving me on the road might suggest that's changed.  So, what the fuck are we supposed to do? There are traffic surveillance cameras.  She had to have passed them.  I'll put in a request for the footage, get a license plate.  I thought this part of my life was over.  So did I.  The moment I asked you to kill her was the moment I started to lose myself and I'm just starting to get back.  I don't wanna deal with this.  I want her gone.  Deb, I'll take care of this.  I promise.  Hannah.  Just thinking about her throws me off course.  I have to put in a request for the traffic footage.  Zach, what are you doing here? You were supposed to meet me at 10:00 this morning.    You could have been followed.    By who? Oh, Detective Quinn?   No, he's pretty easy to lose.    Yeah.  But one day, he'll be there when you don't expect him.  Don't ever come to my home again.    I just wanted to talk to you     Ever.  We can't be seen in public together.  Do you understand?   That's your first lesson.    Jeez, I'm sorry.  It's just   I spoke to Dr.  Vogel, and she     What exactly did she tell you? That you have this, like, way of living that allows you to do what you and I have in common and that might be something that I can do too.  I mean, fuck, I have so many questions.  And I'll answer them as best I can.  Are you gonna help me be like you? Don't even pretend.  Hi, Dexter.    Going for a little night swim.    Enjoy.    Who's she?   That's my neighbour.    She's cute.    Yes, she's cute.  You need to go home.    When are we gonna talk about  ?   I'll call you.  Something has come up that I have to deal with.  It's my day job, which is something you need to get.  Why? I have money.  You're a weird guy who lives with his mom.  You might as well be wearing a sign.  Look, all I'm saying is that you need to have some kind of cover life something that makes you look ordinary.  Yeah, right, yeah.  I get it, yeah.  Zach, I understand what you're going through.  I will help you with this.  Okay.  Thanks.  Not a single sighting since she disappeared? Thank you.  Motherfuck.    What you doing?   Nothing.  Why do you look like you just got caught? Come on, what are you doing? Looking at porn?   No.    Company computer.    Will you  ?   And I am the boss.  Hannah McKay.  Wayne Randall's girlfriend, right? Got arrested a while back for something, then slipped away?   Why you looking her up?   None of your business.  Will you fucking back off?   Jesus, relax.    No, I'm ser   You come in here all the time and invade my space.  You stand so close, try to flirt.  You're fucking making me uncomfortable.  I didn't come in here to flirt.  I just came in here to see if you wanted me to pick you up something for lunch.  I'm all set.  Are we done? Yeah.  Yeah, we're done.  You know what? We're not done, actually.  See, Deb, you came to me six months ago an emotional wreck saying you quit the force and you needed a job.  I gave you that job.  I gave you good pay, good benefits.  I didn't ask a lot of questions.  I put up with a lot of weird shit from you because you're good at your job, and because I'm a nice guy.  So I'm really, really sorry if this cramps your style but next time, maybe you wanna try a little gratitude instead of always being such a fucking bitch.  Now we're done.  There she is.  \"Vista Marina Car Rentals. \" Vista Marina Car Rentals.  This is Stacy.  How may I help you? Hi, Stacy.  This is Detective Cooper over at Miami Metro.  My badge number is 143634.  We're investigating a hit and run.  We think somebody who rented one of your vans might have been a witness.  I was hoping to get some information over the phone.  I can fax you over a copy of the warrant if you'd like.  Oh, I'll just get it for you.  Do you have the license plate? Yes, I do.  It's GLV43951.  The name on that account is Maggie Castner.  The local address is Slip 23, Vista Marina.  Thank you, Stacy.  Want the phone number? Yes, that would be helpful.  813 398 2723.  You may have found her.  If so, a little too easily.  You think she wants to be found? I think she wants to destroy our lives, mine and Debra's both.  Debra's very fragile right now.  The threat of Hannah coming after her could derail the progress she's making.    I won't let that happen.    So, what's your plan?   Slip 23.    You have her number.  You could call.  I don't wanna let her know I've found her yet.  Why do you seem less scared than excited? Because Hannah doesn't scare me.  Maybe you need to rethink that.  They look like nice apartments but you should work things out with your brother.  Angel and I are gonna be fine.  I've just had it with the whole \"big brother ruling over the roost\" routine.  And the thing is What? Well, just most of these places, I have to sign a one year lease and I wasn't sure about About what? Okay.  I'm definitely not pushing you, okay? I'm just trying to be practical here.  If our relationship keeps moving forward we might want to eventually get a place together.    Yeah, eventually.    You don't have to decide now.    It's just something to think about.    Yeah, I'll totally think about it.  Okay.  I'm so sorry.  I blew that whole thing out of proportion.  I just felt like you were trying to, like, get rid of me with the cheque.  I was just trying to be a good, you know, father.  That was really sweet of you.  But it's my problem, and I wanna take care of it.  Well, I can respect that.    So we're cool?   Cool.  How about you and I do dinner tonight? I can't.  I have to work right after class.    You know, pay off the debts.    Well, good for you.  Where are you working? It's a sports bar called Lucky Pete's.  I can call you though, when I'm free.  We can get together.  Okay.  Sounds great.  The Hannah McKay I know hated the ocean.  But it does make for an easy escape into international waters.  Brave of her to be walking around Miami like that.  Or maybe she's found someone to protect her.    May I help you?   I'm just meeting some friends.  I'm sorry, sir.  Members only.  Oh, but I'm a friend of   Even so, sir, we have a strict dress code.  Call it a night, Dexter.    You don't wanna go in there.    I do wanna go in there.  It's their territory.  You'll be at a disadvantage.  I need to know what she's up to.  Dexter.  Is your father a member of the Red Coral Club? Yeah.  It's full of old farts in suits.  Why? Can you get me in there? Tonight? Yeah.  Sure.  Good to see you, Mr.  Hamilton.  This way.    So, what are we doing here?   Looking for someone.  I thought we weren't supposed to be seen together.  This is different.  You know her? That's my ex girlfriend.  Nice.  Who's the guy? I'm gonna find out.  All right, you keep an eye on him.    You text me when he's coming back.    Got it.  Hannah.  It's Maggie now.  You shouldn't be here, Dexter.  I'm not leaving until you tell me why you drugged me and left me on the road.  After what you did to me, I'm not sure that you get to ask questions.  But here I am, asking.  What are you doing back in Miami? I was about to enjoy a martini.  You should probably leave though, before my husband returns.  Your husband? You're married to that guy? Yes.  I'm very lucky.  Yeah.  Well, he seems rich.  You were always a pragmatist.  Well, the money's nice, I have to admit but he has other talents.  Miles is the adventurous type.    What are you doing here?   My husband will be back any minute.  It's in your best interest that he not see us together.  I'm not leaving until you tell me why you did what you did.  I see you've made a friend.  This is my husband, Miles Castner.  Dexter Morgan.  Maggie has told me about you.  How you were her boyfriend until you betrayed her turning her in to the police.  Quite a predicament you left her in.  Shall we finish our drinks? I think it's time for us to go.  Well, that's an excellent idea.  Make sure Mr.  Morgan is given whatever he needs.  Didn't you get my text? I warned you the guy was coming.  I know.  So why didn't you walk away? I mean, I watched him.  I stayed on him.  I didn't fuck up.  I screwed up, not you.  You did exactly as I asked you to.    So, what now?   Nothing.  I'll call you.  We'll talk tomorrow.  So that guy, are we go  ? You gonna kill him? I only kill people who deserve it.    do you hear? Because something sure ain't right.  While them orphans was camping in the woods something gave them a proper fright.  Miles Castner made his fortune in international casinos.  He has the power and the reach to get Hannah a new name, new passport.  But if she's as happy as she seems in her new life then why is she here, messing with mine? Miles Castner.  What kind of name is Miles, anyway? Don't be a chump, Zoomer.  Ain't no such thing as   Hey.    Hey.  Hey.  Hello? Harrison, hello? That's it? I remember when I used to get a hug.  Hey, even I don't matter when Rastamouse is on.  I checked in with Marshals, FBI, fucking Homeland Security.  There hasn't been a single sighting of Hannah McKay.    I'm hoping you've had better luck.    Yeah.  I found her.  She's married.  Well, there's someone for everyone, I guess.  I hope he's sleeping with one eye open.  What's her married name? The guy she's married to is worth $700 million.  He owns casinos.  The name, Dex.  Castner.  Miles Castner.  They're staying on his yacht.  I don't know what they're doing in Miami.  Maybe he has business here.  He seems to know who she is even knows about her and me.  And she seems to like him.  Or maybe she just feels obligated to him.  I doubt Hannah McKay feels obligated to anyone.  It's gotta be operational.  She needs a cover life.  It's not like it's a real marriage.  She can't actually love this guy.  Oh, my God.    You're still in love with her.    What? No.  She's probably trying to kill me.  Trust me, no one knows what it's like to fall in love with the wrong person more than I do.  But you better get your fucking head on straight.  She is everything that is wrong with our lives.  She is a vortex.  She is a black hole.  She sucks everything into her being, leaving nothing behind.  We have got to get her out of our lives.  I'm working on a plan.  Are you sure you can be objective? One little toss of Hannah's pretty blond hair and you turn into a fucking moron.  Hannah? Hannah is here? Both of you? Jesus.  Really? Deb, I'm on top of it.  I'm gonna figure out exactly what she's up to.  Are you? Where is Hannah? Right now she's on a very big boat with her husband.  Niki.  Hey.  Hey, what are you doing here? I came here to see you.  I didn't realise this place was a breastaurant.  I mean, it is a sports bar, it's just topless.    And I make really good money here.    Are you really okay doing this? Yeah.  It's not the best job in the world, but it's also not forever.  I'm fine with it.  I can tell that you're not.  Me? Look, I go to places like this all the time.    See?   I've   Look, I've stared at a million boobs, but until now I've never considered them to be daughter boobs.    Daughter boobs?   Well, come on.  You know what I mean.  Guy, hey.  Her face is up here, okay? Come on.  It's so sweet that you care.  I'm just gonna stay here until something better comes along, okay? Yeah, I'll I'll let you do your thing.  You wanna have dinner on my next free night? Yeah.  That's great.  It actually makes sense in a way that Dexter would have been involved with another killer.  Well, she's back.  And she poisoned us.  Who knows what else she has planned? What does Dexter say? He's trying to figure out what she's up to but he's thinking with the wrong head.    You're concerned for your safety.    And for Dexter's.  Let's take a step back.  From what you've told me if she wanted to kill you, you'd be dead by now.  Maybe she just wants to prove that she has control.  She can kill us whenever she wants.    It's a very unsettling feeling, isn't it?   Yeah.  What is it you'd like to do? I'd like to take her to Marshal Services and have her the fuck arrested.    But Hannah knows too much.    Yeah.  But at least I wouldn't have to worry about what might be in my coffee.  When the Brain Surgeon was out there, a threat to me, I could hardly sleep.  I trusted Dexter to solve the problem, and he did.  And if I can't? Before you take matters into your own hands be sure to consider all the consequences of those actions.  The husband is a complication I don't need.  I have to get Hannah alone, in a situation I control.  Have you done the blood work on the triple in Lummus Park?   Not yet.    There's the prints on the bottle to run and the decomp over in Coconut Grove we have to process.  Yep.  We could use an extra set of hands, right? Someone lower level an extra warm body to offset the cold ones, don't you think? At least to make a dent in the paperwork.    Sure, I guess.    Excellent idea.  Zach.  What's he doing here? Quinn.  Okay.  My client requests that you cease and desist this 24 hour watch you have on him.  He requests it.  I'd like you to back the fuck off.    You took these photos, Zach?   Yeah.    Those are just the best ones.    Quinn, you have anything to say?   I think the kid's guilty.    I'll answer for you, Detective Quinn.  On behalf of the entire department, I can assure you we will   Well, how did you put it, Zach?   back the fuck down.    \"Off. \"   Yeah, that too.  Right Detective Quinn? ,   Right.    That's right.  Gentlemen, let me show you out.  What were you thinking? That rich asshole is walking around free.    We have nothing on this kid.    That's why I was following him.  If this was any other case, I would sign off on the overtime.  But this one let it go.  That's an order.  By the way, me and Jamie are moving in together.  You're what? You're doing what?   Hey, you got a minute?   Make it fast.  Okay, well, Dexter and I are buried in that glass box.    We need an assistant.    I don't know about that.  We've been under budget the last three quarters.    It was Dexter's idea.    Okay.  Part time.  You're one hell of a lieutenant.  The photos were a nice touch.  Thanks.  I thought so.  Well, now he's off my tail, we can get down to business.  You know, find someone to   You know.    Eventually.  What do you mean, \"eventually\"? I mean Long before my father taught me how to do what I do he taught me how not to do it.  Why would I want to not do it? Timing is everything.  One thing you need to learn, the first thing that I had to learn is to wait.  Control your urges.  Channel them appropriately.  Dexter, I can't wait.    I can't control it.    Yes, you can.  You're gonna get your chance, Zach, I promise.  But the only way I've survived as long as I have is by being careful.  I'm gonna teach you how to do that.  And then? And then you'll be able to do what I do and get away with it.    What do you want?   I saw you with your son.  Maggie never mentioned him.  Hard to picture her as the family type.  There's nothing going on between Hannah and me.  Good.  Then listen.  I'd sooner see her in prison than lose her.  Do you understand? Because I could call a few people and ruin your life.  And being a family man, I'm sure that's not what you'd want.  People are so impatient.  Dexter, what are you doing? This is something you don't wanna get in the middle of.  He said he'd sooner see her in prison than lose her.  If that's what he thinks this is about, she's the one in danger.  I thought you were gonna find out if Hannah was a threat to you and Debra not if Miles was a threat to Hannah.  Why can't I do both? Your flowers.  That's the thing about plants.  You don't look after them, they die.  So, what's up? Miles just confronted me at a gas station.  God.    He likes to be dramatic.    Is he a threat? A \"chop you up and toss you in the ocean\" kind of threat? No.  But he could make your life miserable, have people look into you and follow you around 24/7.  He sounds like a great guy.  And you're really in a position to judge? Why did you marry him? Because he was there when you weren't.  I needed him, Dexter.  I met him a few years ago when I did some flowers for him at an event and he found my background intriguing.  I could tell he had a crush on me, so when I made my escape when I had nothing and was desperate I knew that he could give me a whole new life a new identity, money.  Plus, he makes me happy.  Bullshit.  If you're so damn happy, what are you doing back here? Why'd you drug Debra and me?   I think you should go.    Answer me.  I wanted to make sure you weren't gonna put me in jail.    I had to see if you would come to me.    I did, and you haven't told me why.  Because it doesn't matter why anymore.    I changed my mind.    About what? I wanted you to kill Miles for me.  You what? He's possessive and controlling and obsessed with me to the point where he follows me everywhere.  I might as well be in prison.  If I were to try and leave him, he would just turn me in.  Why haven't you dealt with this in your usual way? His family already thought I was some gold digger when we got married.  If he was gonna drop dead suddenly I would be the first person that they would turn to.    Once the cops get a good look at me     You wanted me to make him disappear.  I thought you might feel like you owed me.    Owed you?   You didn't have to turn me in.    You ruined my life.    I did.  It doesn't even matter anymore, because like I said, I changed my mind.  This is my problem, and I'm gonna deal with it.  Why did you change your mind? Because the moment that I saw you there unconscious I realised that despite the shitty way that it all ended you were it for me, Dexter.  I've never felt that way about anyone before or since.  You're the only person that I can be that honest with.  And I didn't wanna ruin that by manipulating you into doing something that might be bad for you.  It was the same for me.  No, just leave it at that.  I have to go before Miles finds out where I've gone.    Hannah.    Goodbye.  Hey.  Can I borrow that high tech GPS tracker thingy that you have? Please? Yeah.  Being nice when you need something, huh? I'm not surprised.  Sorry that I overreacted earlier.  I know that you're interested.  You act like you are.  But, Jake, you don't wanna get involved with me.  You have no idea who I really am.  I just want a chance to find out.  Can I help you? Is that your car? It's my brother's car.  I think I left my sunglasses in the passenger seat.    He's not answering his phone.    Your brother is? Dexter Morgan.  He lives in the building.  Oh, you're Dexter's sister.  I'm Cassie, his neighbour.  Debra.  Oh, fuck.  You're Cassie.  You went out with him, right? Really? He mentioned me?   You look surprised.    I am.  I guess I figured he thought I was the worst date ever.  He didn't exactly follow up.  But he's nice to me when I see him.  He's kind of impossible to read.    Yeah, that would be Dexter.    Oh, okay, good.    I was starting to think it was me.    Nope, definitely not you.  Hey, since I've got you here, what's his deal? Jamie seems to think he's not over his ex which makes him more attractive.  Apparently, I have a thing for unavailable men.  Sorry.  That was an overshare.    That's all right.  I get it.    It's so crazy, right? I meet this totally nice guy who's completely into me and I'm still hung up on the mysterious man next door who hasn't called.  I don't know you at all, actually, but you seem like a normal girl, you know? If I were you, I would stick with the guy that's obviously interested.  Trust me, Dexter is not a mystery that you wanna solve.  Okay.  Yeah.  Sorry about all that.    It's all right.  Have a good one.    See you.    Hey.    Hey.  You could've come inside.  I just got your text.  Well, you know, I think I've seen enough of that place, you know.  So, what brings you by? I wanted to let you know that a lab assistant position just opened up at Miami Metro and it's yours if you want it.  What does it pay? Thirteen seventy five an hour, plus dental.  I make a lot more money than that here.  You did say that this wasn't your first choice as a line of work.  I figured you'd jump at the chance for a future that didn't include pole dancing.  I'm not gonna be a stripper, Dad.  Hey, it just slipped out.  That's okay.  Well, listen, just do me a favour.  Just think about it, okay? I think it would be good for the both of us.  Okay.  All right.    Bye.    Bye.  Well, that's probably best for all involved.  Two psychopaths together.    Never a good mix.    Hannah's not a psychopath.    She has feelings.    I'll have to take your word for that.  Anyway, I called you over here tonight because I'm concerned about Zach.  He came to me today in a very agitated state.  I didn't let him kill his father and now he's feeling the urge more than ever.  And how do you plan to handle it? I was 10 years old when Harry told me what my future would be.  I didn't kill until I was 19.  Zach can wait.  He just doesn't know he can.  Apples and oranges, Dexter.    Sorry?   You thought you had no choice but to wait because your father told you to.  But you were just a boy who'd never taken a human life.    Zach has already killed.    Don't get me wrong.  I'm glad you took him off your table.  But the moment you did, Zach became your responsibility.  He's relying on you, Dexter.  You need to take this very seriously.  Hi, you've reached Zach Hamilton.  Please leave a message.  Hey, Zach.  It's Dexter.  Let's meet tomorrow afternoon, 2 p. m.  I'll come to your studio.  It's good that Hannah's leaving.  I have enough on my plate trying to turn a young killer into someone like me.  Miles knows that Hannah and I saw each other yesterday.  If Miles will do this to me what will he do to her? So who you tracking? I'm just kidding, obviously.  I don't wanna invade your privacy.  I just wanna see if you need anything.    I'm good.    Okay.  Jake.  I know I can be kind of a dick sometimes.  You don't deserve that.  It's okay.  Most people think I'm a dick too, so I guess we're even.  This past year hasn't been my best.  The truth is, I wouldn't be surviving it if it weren't for you, so thank you.  You're welcome.  Dexter? Come on, what the fuck? Dexter! It looks like he's not home.    Can I give him a message?   Yeah.  Fuck him.  Hey, babe.  Good hunting? Yeah, I found a couple dresses.  I think you'll really like them.  Nice.  I'm guessing today's shopping went better than yesterday's.    About the same.    Really? That's surprising, considering there probably isn't much of a selection at your old greenhouse.  What are you talking about? You were with your friend Dexter Morgan.  Well, he a   He asked to see me.  He wanted to make sure that I was all right after you confronted him and I told him that everything was fine that we were very happy together, end of story.  Don't lie to me.  I know the truth.  No, Miles, I told you, I don't care about him anymore.    So you won't be too upset, then.    About what? About what yesterday's excursion is going to cost your friend.    Miles, that's unnecessary.    You've made it necessary.  No, please, don't hurt him.  Don't hurt him? Why, because you love him? No, I promise you, I'm not ever gonna see him again.  He's the reason you insisted on coming with me to Miami returning to a place where you're a wanted criminal.  Miles.  He's the unfinished business you mentioned.  I want you to know I forgive you.  We're going to make a new beginning.  I've already told the crew we're leaving tonight.  We'll sail up the coast and cross the Atlantic just the two of us, for the rest of our lives.    That's how much I care about you.    No, Miles.  Stop it, please.    You'll never have to leave this boat.    Stop, please.  I've given you everything.  You belong to me.  No, stop it.  Get off.  I I tried to run but he just grabbed me.  I didn't mean for it to happen this way.  Are you hurt? I'm okay.  We need bleach, bags something to cut with, an axe or a saw or something like that.  You think you can get me those without letting the crew know that anything's wrong? Yeah, I think so.  Yes.  Wait, you need to change.    Right.    Hannah.  It's gonna be okay.  I'll take care of everything.  I believe you.  So that's how you make people disappear.  Give or take a plastic room and a kill table, yeah.  Yeah, I remember that part.  Do you ever wish that you had followed through? With killing me? No.  You ever wish you had? I was never going to kill you, Dexter.  It's just Well, I knew I couldn't live with Miles for much longer and unlike you, I don't actually enjoy any of this.  So, what's next? I told the crew that Miles was going to New York for a few days so that should buy me some time.  What's wrong? I have to go to a crime scene at my apartment building.    What does that mean?   I don't know.  I have to go.  Please don't leave town before we talk again.  I won't.  This could be my apartment.  Cassie.  Dexter? What happened? I don't know.  I just got here.  Cassie and I, we were supposed to have a date tonight.  I'm sorry.  I know you were friends.  You okay to work this? Yeah.  Yeah.  What do you see? She was bludgeoned.  See those marks on her neck? Someone held her down and beat her to death.  God.  Norma Rivera was bludgeoned.  Is it possible Zach did this when I was with Hannah? Harry was a good teacher to me because he was normal, human.  But can anything good come from putting two killers together whether it be student and teacher or whatever Hannah and I have? Or will it always end the same way like this?

        "script": "Previously on Dexter: Remember me? What are you doing here? You should leave before my husband returns.  Your husband? Oh, God.  You're still in love with her? No.  We have got to get her out of our lives.  What is it you'd like to do? I would like to take her to Marshal Services and have her arrested.  When the Brain Surgeon was out there, I trusted Dexter to solve the problem.  Before you take matters into your hands, be sure to consider all the consequences.  Can I borrow that high tech GPS tracker? Zach Hamilton killed Norma Rivera.  What if you were to teach Zach the code? Am I ready to be a spiritual father? Are you gonna help me be like you? Hi, Dexter! Going for a little night swim.  Enjoy.  What the fuck were you thinking? That asshole is walking around free.  We have nothing.  That's why I was following him.  Let it go.  That's an order.  By the way, me and Jamie are moving in together.  What? Why did you marry him? He was there when you weren't.  No, Miles, stop.  You'll never leave this boat.  I told the crew that Miles was going to New York for a few days.  Please don't leave town before we talk again.  I won't.  Come on, what the fuck? Dexter! It looks like he's not home.  Cassie.  Norma Rivera was bludgeoned.  Is it possible Zach did this? Every contact leaves a trace.  That idea is the foundation of all crime scene analysis.  I should be focused on who bludgeoned Cassie and why.  But instead, ever since Hannah came back into my orbit, she's all I can think about.  Manner of death? Swan.  Killer didn't plan this.  It was impulsive.  This is just how Zach Hamilton killed Norma Rivera.  She was killed pretty deep in her apartment.  Like she let the killer in herself.  So she knew him.  That guy she was dating.  You said you were coming here to pick Cassie up for a date.  Yes, I was late.  Where were you coming from? I had a   The building inspection.  I'm a structural engineer.  Well, maybe I was wrong.  Maybe it was the repairman or the delivery guy.  Or Zach Hamilton.  If I'd paid more attention to Zach instead of being with Hannah, would Cassie still be alive? Is that Zach's blood? Zach knew Cassie.  He met her once, here with me.  Cassie was a good person.  You sure there was no one else she was having issues with? I can't think right now.  Will you please  ? It's okay, it's okay.  Hey, Deb.  How are you? I'm okay.  It's good to see you at a crime scene.  Heh.  I'm gonna talk to Dex.  Go ahead.  Harrison's asleep.  Thanks.  That's a break.  Could that be the killer's blood? Here's hoping.  Are you okay? Sure.  Why the fuck do I even ask? What about Hannah? What about her? Is she still here? Hey, Deb.  Hey.  Who would want to kill Cassie? She owe people money? We're looking into that.  What about customers or a vendor? Sorry.  I have no fucking business being here.  Any time you wanna come back, the door's always open.  Maybe I'll put an application in the mail.  I'll come back to finish this conversation, yeah? Okay.  Can't wait.  I would give everything to feel nothing again.  We need to get you out of town as soon as possible.  I need a new passport.  I have a guy that can do that.  I'll find out what he needs.  That's just a phone call.  You could have phoned me, rather than driving all the way down here.  This was on the way to the lab.  This marina is not on the way to the lab.  You know, we, um We missed a spot of blood cleaning up.  No, we didn't.  Edge of the whisky bottle.  I noticed it this morning.  I was so glad to see it because it reminded me of you.  Did you clean it up? Yes, I cleaned it up.  With bleach? Yes.  Miami is not the place for you to be right now.  The sooner we get you out of here, the better.  I completely agree.  It is Zach's blood under Cassie's nails.  He killed another innocent woman.  What a waste.  He could have had a great future.  Miami Metro can never know.  It's one small step from Zach to me.  Hey, Dex.  Remember Niki, the apple that didn't fall too far from my tree? Hi.  Hi.  Around here we call Dexter \"the king of spatter. \" We do? I do, in private.  Hey, feel free to send any and all paperwork her way.  Here you go.  Oh, uh, the blood under Cassie's nails? No luck.  It was hers.  From a transfer after her head started to bleed.  \"The victim collapsed into a pool of her own blood. \" Hey, are you  ? Are you okay with all this? I mean, I am a little bit worried about the energy around here.  Well, then maybe we can hang a crystal in the corner.  Yeah, we should sage the place first.  Could I talk to you for a sec? Actually, I'm   Real quick.  You recognise these? Yeah, I took them.  Yeah, now look at these.  Norma Rivera, Cassie Jollenston.  Are they fucking similar, or what? They were both bludgeoned.  Bludgeonings can look pretty fucking similar.  Do you think Zach Hamilton could have done this? Zach knew Norma.  How could he have possibly known Cassie? I know, it's crazy, I   What's crazy is Batista and Matthews wanted you to lay off looking into this Hamilton kid.  This Hamilton kid is a fucking monster.  You know it too.  Not really.  I think you should drop this.  Think about your career.  It's not like I'm gonna make sergeant.  Do me a favour.  You see any of Zach's DNA at the crime scene, just let me know.  Absolutely.  He hasn't returned my calls.  I tried to reach him too.  I spoke to his parents, they haven't seen him.  He could be on the run, hiding out somewhere.  Were you with that Hannah person? Is that why this woman is dead? She's dead because you talked me out of killing Zach in the first place.  He showed real potential.  You saw that.  I thought you were having an impact on him.  Zach spoke to me of trying to live up to your rules, your standards.  I thought he was processing it all.  Yeah, Zach's smart, but he can't control himself.  We both should have seen that.  Zach's just a boy.  A boy who knows too much about me, about you, who's killed two innocent women.  No, I guess you don't have many options, do you? No.  I wonder if it will be different for you, because of what could have been.  I doubt it.  But surely there have been people that were more difficult for you to   How do you like to say it? Take care of.  Zach Hamilton is not one of them.  I'm not sure I believe you.  Zach rented a room in Fiesta Key.  He's on the run, and using his own credit card.  Rookie mistake.  I forget the impact murder has on real people.  Deb.  Ahem.  Any luck? With what? Cassie's case? Is that why you're here? No.  Hey, Jamie.  How are you doing? I don't know how you two do this every day.  I don't.  Right.  On a scale of one to 10, where the fuck is Hannah? She's not a threat.  Last time we talked, you said, \"I'm on top of it. \" And I am.  Are you on top of it, or on top of her? Deb   Is she in Miami? What the fuck is she doing here? It has to do with her husband.  The casino guy? He's abusive, verbally and physically.  They seem perfect.  What about him? She wanted me to   Why didn't she do it herself? Too much scrutiny.  Did you do it? No.  Well, that must have pissed her off.  What's to keep her from trying to kill us again? She didn't try to kill us.  She wanted my attention.  By poisoning me and leaving you on the side of the fucking road? You have the fucking altitude to see all of this, that she's using you, and you still want to protect her? Once she gets her passport, she'll be out of our lives forever.  You believe that? I do.  Well, that's the thing that you can't see, that you're lying to yourself.  She's a murderer.  She needs to be locked up.  She could talk.  After LaGuerta, I can't afford another round of questions.  She's a fugitive.  She's a poisoner.  She's easily discredited.  Enough already.  We were supposed to have lunch together, Cassie and me.  Jamie, I'm sorry.  I can't be here right now.  I can take Harrison with me.  I moved in with Joey.  Oh.  I thought we'd go there, since you're on the next few days.  I mean, if that's okay with you.  Yeah, that's okay with me.  Don't smile? Just send this to the passport guy.  He'll have a new identity and all the paperwork for you by tomorrow.  Do I get to pick my name? I doubt it, but I'll ask.  So does he drop it off, or  ? No, I will.  Okay, so just wait here? Maybe you should come with me.  Where? I have to go to the Keys tonight.  The Keys? It would just be for the night.  Besides, it's not safe for you to be here.  Safe? You know, alone.  I sent the crew away for a few hours because I knew that you were coming.  They can protect me from almost anything.  It's the \"almost\" that concerns me.  So, what's in the Keys, or should I say who is in the Keys? I'll tell you on the way down.  How would you like to make a boatload of cash? I'm assuming that's a rhetorical question.  U. S.  Marshal Service is offering $25,000 for information leading to the arrest of Hannah McKay.  Sal Price's publisher is offering another 125,000, his family, another hundred.  Put that together   Two fifty.  Yeah, I can do math.  I think Hannah McKay is back in Miami.  And you think this because? Are you interested or not? Very.  No fucking way.  They're gone.  You sure this is the Castner slip? I'm sure.  You sure McKay was under the alias of \"Maggie Castner\"? Yes.  What, you don't believe me? Lot of pretty blond girls in Miami.  You sure Hannah McKay was here? I know for a fucking fact that she was.  How? I just do.  You really don't like her, do you? Nope.  I'm just saying, emotions cloud your judgement, you know? You keep it about the money, someday you may have a yacht.  I don't want a fucking yacht.  Well, I do.  So let's keep it about my money, all right? So the yacht may be gone, but we don't know if they were on it.  Maybe the dock master knows something.  I'll see.  I'll meet you back at the office, all right? Joey, I don't want to be here alone.  You're not alone, you got the kid.  My name is Harrison.  And a fine name that is.  Don't you got some cartoons to watch? Joey, I am freaking out.  My friend was murdered.  I   Look, I know, but once I catch the killer, you're not gonna have to be scared anymore, okay? You know, if it were Deb asking you to stay, you wouldn't even put up a fight.  Deb wouldn't ask me to stay.  She'd want to catch the killer as bad as I do.  Sorry I'm not Deb.  Hey, hey, hey, come here.  You need me to stay here, I'll stay here, okay? Motherfuck it.  Hey, Deb, what's up? Hey, just checking in about Hannah.  I haven't seen her.  Where are you? Grabbing some dinner.  Oh, yeah? Want company? No, I'm good.  No, seriously.  I'll join you.  Where are you? Um Look at a fucking street sign.  I'm on the highway.  How about tomorrow? Sure.  Dick for brains.  She's a ray of sunshine, isn't she? So, what'd you say to the crew? I told them to head on to St.  Kitts.  It was our next stop after Miami anyway.  They're paid not to ask questions.  Hm.  So who are you after? His name is Zach.  What did Zach do? Disappoint me.  He was someone Dr.  Vogel thought I could, uh, mentor.  Who's Dr.  Vogel? Dr.  Evelyn Vogel.  She studies psychopaths.  My father went to see her about me.  Heh.  How did that conversation go? \"Hey, I've got this son who has these urges. \" He was at the end of his rope.  Dr.  Vogel's the one who came up with the idea of the code.  She created me.  Wow.  I know.  So how does it feel to finally meet her, to find out that she even existed? Like finding a family member.  Well, she must be very proud of you.  Are there others of you out there? Just Zach, as far as I know.  She thought he She saw a little of me in him, or who I used to be.  Focused.  Driven.  There's one big difference though.  He'd already killed an innocent woman when I met him, and now he's killed another.  So he's a terrible student.  I wasn't exactly a hands on teacher.  He's fled to the Keys.  I can't have him out there in the world.  He's a problem you have to solve.  I was a problem you had to solve too, and I escaped.  How come you never tried to find me? And do what? Solve the problem.  I liked knowing you were out there.  Elway, it's me.  Hey, I was just about to call you.  Dockmaster ends up being a gabby fuck.  He heard Mr.  Castner flew yesterday to New York sans Mrs.  Castner, who just sent the yacht to St.  Kitts earlier today.  Where she is now is anybody's guess.  I'll venture one, the Keys.  Is this something you just know, or you have a source? I'm on my way down there now to check it out.  You know about her husband being with her? You said Castner was in New York.  I checked the airport, the Gulfstream never left the tarmac, so I wonder if she killed him.  Heh heh heh.  There's a leap.  That's what she fucking does.  She murders people and she gets away with it.  I cannot wait to fucking find her.  Remember what I said.  No crusaders on the payroll.  Let's find her, let's bring her in, let's get paid, okay? Thank you.  Shrimp? Yeah.  Bottom feeders.  Uh huh.  They eat all the garbage at the bottom of the ocean.  They take out the trash.  Mm.  Is that what you do? You take out the trash? Thought might have crossed my mind.  You have all these clever sayings inside your head, don't you? About what you do and who you are.  Yeah, I think a lot.  Mm.  I'm sure you do.  So, what brilliant turn of phrase have you come up with to describe me? The evil temptress? Passionate poisoner? Heh.  Fiendish florist.  Really, when you're lying in bed at night and I happen to cross your mind, what do you call me? Hannah.  You're just Hannah.  You're such a flirt.  No, I'm not.  I'm just being honest.  Please, you're the master manipulator.  I am? Yes, you are.  Is that what you call me? No, I have a million names for you.  Really? I'd love to hear them.  What can I get you guys? Are you sure this is the place? Just wait in the car.  What is all this? A for effort, huh? He made a lot of mistakes.  But for a first try, it's not bad.  It's not bad.  No.  It's not great either.  Better than your first try.  Do you have to do this? Yes, I do.  And when I find him, I'll use this room.  Detective Quinn.  Hey, how are you holding up? I haven't slept much, to be honest.  We, uh, talked about a life together, Cassie and I.  I know it's fast, but   No, no, no.  I move fast too.  Too fast.  Well, when it's right You're going through a tough time.  I was wondering if you could take a look at a photo for me.  Have you seen that kid around Cassie? Maybe at her food truck? Is this who you think killed her? Just a person of interest.  I don't know him.  He looks familiar, but I'm sorry.  What on earth is your daughter doing? She's just clearing the bad murder juju out of the lab.  Does she realise this is a department founded in bad murder juju? Where are we on this Cassie Jollenston murder? Been working on the customers from her food truck, but most of them paid in cash, so So they're hard to track down.  Any other leads? None worth talking about.  I thought you said you weren't a real hands on teacher.  I didn't teach him this.  You did this to him? Yes.  And he escaped.  I let him go.  Like me? Not quite.  Dexter? What the fuck? I told you to control yourself, and what did you do? You killed Cassie.  Cassie? Who's Cass  ? Who the fuck is that? You killed her next door to me, to my son! No, no, no! I went after Shawn Decker.  Shawn Decker, who is that? Wait.  Aren't you that old guy's wife? Your ex girlfriend? She's with me now.  Nice.  Did you take out her husband? Who is Shawn Decker? This asshole I knew in high school.  He offed a girl two years ago on spring break then bragged about it.  Is she cool? Yes.  She's cool.  Where were you two days ago? I stopped by your place after you blew me off, then I came straight here.  I met your neighbour, the hot one.  That was Cassie.  She was alive when I left.  I've been on Shawn the whole time.  I'll show you on my camera.  How did you  ? How did you find me? I tracked your credit card.  Right.  Shouldn't use my own card, fuck up on my part.  What'd you think of the room? Did you do something to it? Just show me the pictures.  Sorry.  This is Shawn Decker.  He lives here.  You can see by the time stamp, I've been hunting him.  So I decided to go after a killer.  Someone who deserves it.  He was following the code without even knowing it.  Do you have proof that Shawn killed someone? Yeah, he pulled me aside at a party, showed me this video of this redhead he met in Daytona.  He accidentally strangled her while they were having sex.  Believe me, world's better off without him.  Where is Shawn now? It   It didn't go exactly as I planned.  I thought I could just knock him out.  You sedated me, didn't you? What did you use? What happened? I hit him over the head, but it wasn't hard enough.  He barely went down, so I just kept hitting him, like, a lot.  Did anyone see you? No, we were alone.  What were you planning on doing with the body? I didn't totally know.  I was gonna come back here, get my camera, my knives, I don't know, guess I just thought drop him in the Everglades   So you didn't have a plan.  I did.  I was gonna do it here.  I mean, this place isn't bad, is it? You see that second floor? Anyone could see you moving a body.  That wasn't on the website.  Pick a different place.  I'd already paid for the room.  You need to have a plan and a backup plan, always.  Driving with a body in your trunk in this heat is no plan at all.  You didn't even put plastic in your car.  Oh, okay, that would've been a good idea, yeah.  You and I are gonna deal with this body, and then scrub the car clean of DNA, because one drop of blood, a single hair, could lead straight back to you.  Then after that, we're gonna dump the car.  Well, how am I gonna get home? We'll take you.  Awesome.  Can you deal with the room? We should be a few hours.  Yeah, drive safe.  Dude.  Do not \"dude\" me.  Get in the car.  Watch yourself on the handle.  I cut myself on that piece of shit a few days ago.  Have you cut yourself on this before? No.  Is that somehow how Zach's blood ended up under Cassie's nails? I bled all over the place.  Look.  Fuck me.  Gloves! Just put your seat belt on.  Hannah fucking McKay.  Don't even think about it.  Where's Dexter? Out.  Great, that'll make this a lot easier.  I'm supposed to just put those on? You're under arrest.  You're not a police officer anymore.  Citizen's arrest.  Oh, right, really? How about I arrest you for aiding a serial killer? You want that information out? Talk all you fucking like.  No one would fucking believe you.  Better people than you have tried it.  Go ahead.  No! The only way I'm leaving is if you shoot me, and you're not gonna.  I have done terrible things in my past, but I've come to realise that as people, we're all horribly flawed, some more than others.  I'm not interested.  But we all have a will to survive, and when in extreme situations, people do extreme things.  That doesn't make it right.  Right or wrong doesn't make it into the equation.  There are other forces driving us.  What's driving you? Dexter.  The passing of the torch.  I taught you the code.  Now he's learning it from you.  And look at him.  You used to feel like that after a kill.  At peace.  Life was so simple then.  Killing consumed you, crept into everything you did.  It was all you had.  But now? Now I have Harrison.  He isn't a complication.  Hannah is.  She's more of a distraction.  Or is it possible there's a stronger desire in you now? Stronger than the need to kill? I don't enjoy killing.  Why do you do it? Sometimes it's the only way to solve a problem.  When somebody comes at me or threatens me, my life   Like me? I could've killed you the other day and it would've made my life easier, but I didn't.  Why? Because I love your brother, and I   I've learned how much he cares about you.  I didn't want to hurt him.  He loves me too.  Do you really want to hurt him? Fuck.  My brother screws up everything.  Oh, you're both still breathing.  That's a good sign.  What are you doing here? I came here for her.  But how did you  ? GPS.  I put it under your car.  You what? I knew you wouldn't stay away.  Who the fuck are you? Who the fuck are you? I don't want to know.  I don't want to know anything else ever.  She's your problem now.  Dude.  I'm sorry, you got girls fighting over you? Let's get out of here.  Are we there yet? Zach.  Hey.  Zach, it turns out, is a fast learner.  Well, I'm very relieved to hear that.  Why don't you come in, have dinner? I'm starving.  I can't.  Who is that in the car? That's Hannah.  Hannah McKay? You weren't going to introduce us? Well, we've had a really long drive, and she's leaving early tomorrow.  I think we're tired.  Surely, you must be hungry.  She can join us for dinner.  No, that's not   I insist.  Either you invite her in or I will.  Dr.  Vogel, um, this is Hannah.  Hi, nice to meet you.  Pleasure.  Call me Evelyn.  I trust there are no vegetarians here.  Hand me your plate.  It looks delicious.  An old family recipe.  Hope it holds out.  I can pass it along to you if you'd like.  I guess you know your way around the kitchen.  I'm an okay cook.  You're better than okay.  Well, I prefer gardening.  Bringing things to life.  Perfect.  The best hobbies are the ones that take us furthest from our primary occupation.  So you have a fascinating field.  How did you get interested in it? Oh, an incident long ago that I won't bore you with.  As to what keeps me interested, well look around the table.  Elbows.  I've always maintained that the greatest obstacle in life isn't danger, it's boredom.  Boredom? Mm.  The battle against it is responsible for most of the events in the world, good or ill.  I'm convinced of it.  Anyway, my patients never fail to surprise.  They make life interesting, thus, worth living.  For example, I would never have imagined that the affection you two share could be possible, for people like yourselves.  You are obviously quite taken with each other.  You both have a healthy blush response.  I'm embarrassing you.  Gee, you think? The truth is, you make a good couple.  And probably a bad one too.  Bon app\u00c3\u00a9tit.  Mm.  There's too much red wine.  Yeah, there is.  No, it's perfect.  Dexter, you haven't said much.  Something on your mind? It's, uh, Cassie's murder.  I doubt there's anything this table can't handle.  The scene, it doesn't make sense.  Did you take any pictures? Whoa.  It's just like Norma Rivera.  Look at the blood.  When someone's bludgeoned to death, blood is no longer just blood.  It's cast off blood, atomised blood, pooled blood.  Different first names but same family, with one story to tell.  I found your blood underneath Cassie's fingernails.  But Zach had nothing to do with Cassie's murder.  So how'd my blood end up there? I'm wondering if it came from your car door handle.  Think someone could have done that to your car on purpose? To set you up for her murder? If so, they went to a lot of trouble to frame you.  And why would someone do that? Money? You see? Never a dull moment.  Hey, look at this, full house.  Welcome home.  Hey, buddy, what's that? A zombie.  Nice.  I hope you don't mind that we're here.  Not at all.  Something happen with Quinn? No, we're fine, I just   You're still shaken up about Cassie.  Is it okay if we stay with you tonight? You two can stay here as long as you want.  Thanks.  Especially if you're gonna cook.  Oh What happened with our fugitive? Does it look like she's handcuffed to my desk? It does not.  You couldn't find her, so we will   We'll keep looking.  Oh, fuck that, Hannah's probably left the country by now.  It's a lost cause.  Heh.  What happened to Miss Personal Vendetta? She took your advice and let it go.  There's a lot of money in this.  I don't care about the money.  What the fuck are you doing here then? I don't know.  I've been asking myself the same question.  Okay, is there something you want to say to me? I'm not sure I'm cut out to be a private investigator.  Bullshit.  Bullshit.  You're the best I've ever worked with   Given the work we do, I'm not really sure that I want it on my tombstone.  Fuck, sorry.  I don't mean to offend you or anything.  It's all right, it's all right.  Forget it, forget it.  I want to wake up now and then and feel like what I do matters more than a pay cheque.  Gotcha.  So, what are you gonna do? You  ? You gonna  ? Gonna go back to being a cop? That what you're gonna do? I don't know, maybe.  Yeah.  There's a reason they call it a public servant.  You want to put your life on the line for slave wages, be my guest.  But I'd advise you to think carefully about throwing away this opportunity.  Hannah, I wish you the best of luck with whatever's next.  Thank you.  And thank you for dinner.  It's refreshing to see a girl who can really eat.  We have to go.  Can you drop Zach off at his home? Of course.  Can I drive? Not a chance.  My car's older than you.  It's not too bad.  Yeah, it's nice.  I'll be by at 6 tomorrow to pick you up.  I'll take a cab.  It's no problem.  I don't want to do this again.  I   I can't do this again.  Say goodbye.  You need anything? Are you hungry? We just ate.  I'm sure if I get hungry there's room service here.  Probably.  I'm just gonna shower and go to bed, get up, go to the dock.  Your plane leaves at 8:00.  Twenty seven minutes later, you'll land in Nassau.  Destroy your old passport.  From there, where you go is up to you.  Where do you think you'll go? Haven't decided.  Argentina? Maybe.  Will you let me know? Yes.  Okay.  I'll wait to hear from you.  Dexter, my passport.  Oh, right.  Almost forgot.  \"Claire Thompson. \" I guess I look like a Claire.  He assured me it's a name that won't get flagged.  It's perfect.  Thank you.  And here's a \"Claire Thompson\" credit card.  I have some cash too, so When you land in Nassau, make your last withdrawal as Maggie Castner.  Keep it under 10 grand.  I can talk you through how to set up an international bank account.  You should go.  I should go.  Every contact leaves a trace.  Everything and everyone we touch is changed in some way.  But the changes they're never what we anticipate.  That's right.  I believe Hannah McKay was just in Miami going under the alias of \"Maggie Castner. \" Hannah.  Don't go.  Stay with me.

        "script": "Previously on Dexter: I should be focused on who bludgeoned Cassie and why.  But instead, since Hannah came back into my orbit, she's all I can think about.  Have you seen that kid around Cassie? I don't know him.  I'm sorry.  Joey, my friend was murdered.  Once I catch the killer, you won't have to be scared anymore.  If Deb were asking you to stay, you wouldn't put up a fight.  She'd want to catch the killer as bad as I do.  Sorry I'm not Deb.  I think Hannah McKay is back in Miami.  Are you interested? Very.  What are you doing here? I came here for her.  Who the fuck are you? Who the fuck are you? I don't wanna know.  I don't want to know anything else ever.  She's your problem now.  I can't go to jail, Hannah.  Lose my kids again? I couldn't take it.  We've always stuck together.  That's not gonna change now, is it? I found your blood underneath Cassie's fingernails.  Zach had nothing to do with Cassie's murder.  How did my blood end up there? Your plane leaves at 8:00.  Twenty seven minutes later, you'll land in Nassau.  From there, where you go is up to you.  Where do you think you'll go? I haven't decided.  Argentina? Every contact leaves a trace.  But the changes, they're never what we anticipate.  I believe Hannah McKay was just in Miami under the alias of Maggie Castner.  Stay with me.  I just want to stay here with you.  I know, but you can't.  Dexter, I'm so sorry about Zach.  I know how much he meant to you.  I need to see Dr.  Vogel and figure out our next move.  You should stay here, inside, out of view.  I have to see Arlene this afternoon after her shift.  Why? It's not safe for me to draw money out of Maggie Castner's account anymore.  The only money I have is what I've been sending away to Arlene to hold for me.  And I'm gonna need that money to start a new life.  Okay.  \"Be careful. \" I know.  Actually, I was gonna say, \"I love you. \" I love you too.  Poor child.  I'm gonna have to find a way to let the family know.  Just give me a little time before Miami Metro gets brought in.  I will.  This is the song that was playing when I found Zach's body.  Do you know it? Of course.  I used to play it all the time.  Still do.  Does it mean anything? It was just a pleasant song.  Possibly my patients heard me playing it.  There are some signs of a struggle.  They fought here.  This table is out of place.  But whoever did this cleaned up after himself.  There's no blood.  I wish I could understand what this is all about.  Why he's doing this.  I mean, it's clearly not simply to frighten me.  He's trying to send a message.  But what is it? I don't care what his message is.  He killed Zach.  He broke into my apartment and dumped his body there.  What if Harrison had been home? I will find who did this, and I will kill him.  I'm sure you will, Dexter.  But you need to remain focused.  I am focused.  Blood.  He missed it.  And a few hairs pulled out by the roots.  There's a big fingerprint in the middle of it all.  Zach's, most likely.  Almost like it was put there deliberately.  Zach learned from me.  He knew the importance of DNA.  It's possible that he ripped these hairs from whoever attacked him and stuck them there for me to find.  If this is a clue, as you said, then Zach acted with extraordinary calm, rational thought.  Yes.  Something I'm not sure you're doing right now, Dexter.  What? Your desire to avenge Zach's death, that's an emotional response, possibly fuelled by having to say goodbye to Hannah.  I didn't say goodbye to her.  How do you mean? We're going to make a life together.  Dexter, how? I don't know.  We'll figure it out.  Over the time I've spent with you, I've come to realise that you're not the perfect psychopath I thought you were.  You have a depth of emotion I never thought possible.  It's true.  I'll find the Brain Surgeon and I'll kill him.  But once I do, I'm gonna focus on a life with Hannah.  I think you misunderstood my point.  Straddling two worlds as you are, it's dangerous.  Killers cannot have a full emotional life.  I think you underestimate me.  So this is Maggie Castner's passport photo.  That's Hannah McKay's.  I won't ask how you got those.  Good.  Please don't.  They look pretty much the same.  Have you had contact? I have not.  Her boat left for St.  Kitt's yesterday, but I don't think she was on it.  What makes you think that? Just a hunch.  A lot of good that does me.  Her husband? Supposedly in New York City, but no record of his jet landing or taking off from here.  Don't know.  All right, then.  I'll look into this.  There's one more thing.  I'd actually like to be a part of the team on this.  Heh.  Thanks, but the marshal service doesn't take on partners.  I understand   If I do find her, you'll get your reward money.  Fair enough.  All right.  Deb.  Hey.  I saw you from my car and I had this moment where it was just like old times.  Tell me you're here to see me.  Quinn, actually.  I meant what I said the other day.  We'd love you to come back with us.  I don't think Matthews would go for it.  He was pissed that I left so abruptly.  You never know, Deb.  I'll leave you two be.  Thanks for coming.  I need to ask you for a favour.  Yeah.  Anything.  I think I know who Cassie's killer is, but Matthews asked me to lay off.  The guy's from this rich family.  Could you look into him for me? Sure.  This all you have? Yup.  His info.  Social, address, his name's Zach Hamilton.  Kid's a serial killer in the making.  I think Cassie's the second person he killed.  Yeah, I'll get right on it.  I'm gonna go say hello to Dexter.  The sooner I can identify Zach's killer, the sooner I can be done with all this and get back to Hannah.  You can't go in there.  Sorry.  Who the fuck are you? Hey, hey, hold it.  Deb, uh, this is my daughter, Niki.  Niki, this is former lieutenant Debra Morgan.  Oh, shit.  Sorry.  My dad says you're a total rock star.  Why'd you leave? She's a curious one.  Let's go see some files over here.  Nice to meet you! What the fuck are you doing with Zach Hamilton? Quinn called.  He thinks Zach killed Cassie.  I thought so too, but I checked it out.  Zach didn't.  What was Zach doing with you and Hannah in the Keys? Serial killers convention? I was helping Dr.  Vogel out.  I don't know why I even ask you these questions.  No one else knows.  Zach's dead.  Now I know.  I don't want to know, because now I have to explain how I know.  Kind of, yes.  I was thinking about coming back here.  About being a detective again, doing something good for a change.  But It'll just lead me into another fucked up situation, won't it? A familial match to Dr.  Evelyn Vogel? What? The hairs we found in Zach's studio.  I ran a mitochondrial DNA match on them.  It tests a person's mother line.  Yeah, I'm aware of those tests.  Well, it's a direct match to you.  Zach's killer is related to you.  The Brain Surgeon is related to you.  How is that possible? I have no family.  Well, not anymore.  Anymore.  Well, I was married and I had two sons.  Daniel and Richard.  And now? They're gone.  What happened to them? One day, I found Richard, he was my youngest, at the bottom of our swimming pool, dead.  At first I thought it was an accident.  He wasn't a strong swimmer.  But then I realised the truth.  My older son, Daniel he He killed Richard.  Yes.  Daniel was   Daniel was highly intelligent.  But he was also very troubled.  No, it was much more than that.  He was devoid of empathy, had a complete lack of fear or the sense of right and wrong.  He was a psychopath.  Realising this and wanting to find a way to help Daniel led me into this field.  I failed Daniel.  I I was never able to treat him.  Maybe that's one reason I was so determined to help you.  This is Daniel.  My husband and I covered up his involvement in Richard's death.  Said it was an accident and then we put Daniel into a mental health institute.  He was only 14.  Here in Miami? No.  No, I sent him back to England.  Three years later, he was dead.  How? A fire broke out in the wing where Daniel was living.  Some idiot nurse had left the door locked to take a coffee break.  The children couldn't get out.  Seven of them perished.  One of them was Daniel.  Did you see the body? No.  My husband did.  He was horribly burned.  If it was his body.  That's preposterous, Dexter.  He can't be alive.  You said yourself he's highly intelligent.  Could've faked his death.  But after all these years, why would he do these terrible things now? The brain cores.  Do they mean anything to you? Well Well, even as a child, Daniel was aware that he lacked empathy and how I felt about it.  It's possible he boxed some up and left it at my door.  Daniel Vogel would be in his mid 40s.  Anybody.  Nobody.  That guy Cassie was dating.  He was interviewed that night.  Oliver Saxon.  Is it possible this is Vogel's son? Daniel Vogel is Oliver Saxon.  You created half a dozen fake IDs.  He could've done the same.  The easiest way is to assume the identity of a dead person.  Oliver Saxon, death certificate.  The guy's a fake.  Doesn't mean he's your brain surgeon.  I need to get a DNA sample from him.  Dexter, this is Deputy Marshal Clayton.  He's here on a tip that Hannah McKay is back in Miami.  Uh, sorry if I don't seem glad to meet you, this is kind of a shock.  I guess you haven't talked to her.  Why would I? I told him that you dated Hannah before you turned her in for the Sal Price murders.  Wasn't the smoothest breakup.  I guess not.  And that makes you a target.  Frankly, the Hannah McKay I knew would be too smart to risk coming back to Miami.  Could be.  Look, I got no definite information she's here.  I'm just following up on a tip.  But until we know for sure, we should put unis on you till this plays out.  That's the last thing I need trying to help Hannah hide.  On the other hand, the Brain Surgeon's still out there.  He knows where I live.  I don't need unis to watch me, just my apartment and my son when he goes to school.  Don't worry, we'll watch Harrison like a hawk.  Deputy Marshal Clayton, how do you plan to find Hannah even if she is here? Getting her picture out with local media, asking anyone to call if they spot her.  Okay.  But if by some chance she decides you two need to talk things over, be sure and give me a call, won't you? Of course.  I want her behind bars as much as you do.  Okay.  This is exactly what Vogel warned you about.  Trying to straddle both worlds.  You should be following up on Saxon right now.  Let Hannah handle her own problems.  I can do both.  Hey.  Have you gone to see Arlene yet? No, I was just about to leave.  Don't.  I just had a federal marshal in my office.  They know you're here.  Oh, God.  You can't go to Arlene's.  Lay low.  I can't start a new life without that money.  I can give you money.  Half a million dollars? Well, no.  I'll drive you.  I'm not letting you go by yourself.  Okay, but hurry.  This marshal changes everything.  We can never be together here.  I know.  What are we gonna do? Let's get your money, figure it out later.  You were right, the hotel manager in Key West positively ID'd Zach.  He was down there when she was killed.  Where do you get your information? I have my sources.  Wish I had your sources.  Thought I had this one nailed.  Well, you're at square one.  You've been there before.  You'll close it.  Just after the whole sergeant dick dance, you know, I got something to prove.  You're a good cop.  You don't have to prove anything.  Then there's Jamie, you know, I'd kind of like to solve it for her.  She was really close to Cassie.  Yeah.  I just haven't been there for her lately.  I thought she moved in.  I mean, like, emotionally.  Heh.  Since when are you Mr.  Sensitive? Fuck you.  It pours right out of you.  You know, she's always accusing me of comparing you to her.  Oh.  Um Well, I mean, I can't really advise you on that.  Puts me in an awkward position.  Why? Because of our history, asshole.  I mean, history is history, right? Jamie knew Cassie better than anyone.  Question her again .  Maybe something'll turn up.  She's been a wreck, it's hard walking the line between boyfriend and cop.  I'll talk to her.  Really? Yeah.  Be fun to play cop again.  That'd be great.  Thanks.  You can buy me lunch.  And two fucking desserts.  Nice place.  Found that when you're a fugitive, asking somebody to hold half a million dollars, incentives help.  So Arlene gets a cut? She gets what she needs to keep the kids off welfare, I get   The bank of Arlene.  Exactly.  Hey, babe.  Hey, Arlene.  Huh.  You're the asshole who turned her in.  That would be me.  Long story.  Can we come in? Yeah.  So now we're back together, huh? How's that gonna work out? We're figuring it out.  I told the kids there's snakes in here so they wouldn't go near it.  There you go.  Ah, shit.  Who's that? Federal marshal.  Stay here.  I'll handle this.  You answer the door.  Come with me.  Like you've got nothing to hide.  Can I help you? I'm Deputy Marshal Clayton.  You mind if I ask you a few questions?   Uh, Yeah.    Yeah.  Dexter Morgan.  What are you doing here? Arlene's a friend.  We met through Hannah.  Really now? Yeah, I stopped by to tell her what you said, Hannah might be in Miami.  Yeah, I gotta keep an extra eye on the kids.  Looks like you recently changed your address.  Seems like a step up.  Better school district.  Says here you work part time waiting tables at Denny's.  That's right.  That won't buy you a doll's house, let alone pay rent on this.  You sure you haven't gotten help from Hannah McKay, who just happened to have married a man worth over half a billion dollars? Didn't even know she was married.  Says here you got a record.  Do you have any idea how many years aiding and abetting a fugitive buys? I'm the one who's been helping out Arlene.  Heh.  Now I see what you two really bonded over.  You sure can pick them.  Listen, do me a favour.  Either of you hear from your old friend, Hannah McKay, you give me a call.  Of course.  Yeah, we will.  Hey, Deb.  Dexter's not here.  I know, I was driving by.  Wanted to say hello to the little man.  Oh.  Look, Aunt Deb, I can write my name.  That's awesome.  I am so sorry about Cassie.  You doing okay working here and everything? Honestly, no.  Not really.  The cops are watching the place, which helps.  She have a lot of friends? Yeah.  She's pretty popular.  Everyone's just in shock, you know? Especially Oliver.  Who's that? This guy Cassie was dating.  Were they dating for a long time? Just a couple weeks.  I guess it was love at first sight.  At least for him.  What do you mean \"for him\"? Between us, I think Cassie was gonna break it off with Oliver.  Then he was all, \"Let's go to the Bahamas for a week. \" After two weeks of dating? He kept pushing her into it.  He wouldn't take \"no\" for an answer.  You weren't a fan, I take it.  I thought he could be a little clingy.  But he was great to Cassie.  Hey, we should all have someone who worships us like that, right? Hm.  When was the trip supposed to happen? This week, I think.  Hey.  Quinn, it's me.  I just talked to Jamie.  We need to revisit the boyfriend.  Oliver Saxon.  So you think Clayton bought your little story? I'm not sure.  Either way, he's got your photo all over Miami.  It's not safe to go to the hotel.  You need something private.  Yeah, but where? I do know of one place.  Something tells me it's the last place I'll want to go.  Debra's, if I can talk her into it.  I was right.  I can't think of a better option, can you? Unfortunately, I can't.  Answering more questions? Anything I can do to help find who did this to Cassie.  This must be hard on you.  The last few days have been a nightmare.  I still can't even believe it.  I just wish I had time to breathe, I'm so busy at work.  I'm already late for an appointment.  Won't take long.  What is it you do, exactly? Building inspections.  Where you were when Cassie died? Yes.  You're welcome to look at my workbook, I was in Sunny Isles inspecting a new condo.    Just a few minutes from here.  Yes.  You must be pretty busy, huh? I'm booked wall to wall for the next few weeks.  Oh, really? I thought you and Cassie were planning a trip to the Bahamas.  How were you gonna work that in? I guess that was a little crazy.  Cassie kept pushing, I didn't want to disappoint her.  Oh, it was her idea? Yeah.  She wanted a romantic getaway.  Seems a little fast, don't you think? After a few weeks of dating.  I know it's hard for most people to understand, but we had something special.  And we both knew it.  Look, I'm really sorry, you guys.  I've got to get going.  Maybe we can pick this up later? Yeah, no.  We'll come back another time.  That would be great.  Thanks.  He lied to us.  About what? Jamie said that whole Bahamas thing was his idea.  A way for Cassie not to dump him.  That doesn't mean he's a killer, you know.  He just could be fucking obsessed with her.  It wouldn't hurt to look into it.  Look a little deeper into his alibi.  I'll get on that.  Feel that? What? Us, you know, working together again.  It's nice, you know? Yeah, it's a lot better than doing background checks for Elway.  Yeah.  I forgot how much I like it.  Shit.  Uh I'm sorry.  I don't know why I did that.  Let's just pretend you didn't.  Okay.  Okay.  What the fuck? Sorry, we let ourselves in.  You two should talk alone.  I need a place where Hannah can stay.  And you want that to be my place? There's a federal marshal after her.  He knows she's in Miami.  He's gonna do everything he can to find her.  It's the only move I could think of.  To bring Hannah to my house? I know.  It's only for a couple of nights.  Just until I can get her out of Miami.  Please? A couple of nights, that's it.  Thank you.  You could also thank me for getting Quinn off Zach's trail.  How? Simple.  Get him to focus on the boyfriend.  Oliver Saxon.  Saxon? You think he did it? Well, he's a damn good suspect.  Quinn and I talked to him today.  If Saxon thinks the police are onto him, he'll know that I'm onto him.  You should stay away from Saxon, Deb.  He could be more dangerous than you think.  What are you talking about? I can't go into it right now, but please, just do as I ask.  I knew going back to the force would put me in a fucked up situation.  Here it is, ahead of schedule.  He's all yours.  You'll be okay here? Sure.  We'll just hang.  Heh.  If Deb and Quinn did anything to spook Saxon, I have to act fast.  I'm too late.  He's already moved out.  But if this has his DNA I can check it against the hairs I found at Zach's studio.  Here you go.  Are we going to see Hannah? Hannah? Why? I saw her on TV.  They said people are looking for her.  Is she in trouble? No, she's fine.  Hannah's just popular.  You miss her? Yeah.  I liked playing with her.  She was nice.  I wish she could be my mom.  It's a match.  Saxon is Vogel's son.  Daniel.  He's going by the name Oliver Saxon.  He dated my neighbour until he killed her in her apartment two doors down from mine.  Do you have any idea where he is? No, he cleared out of his place.  He could be anywhere right now.  Suppose you do find him, Dexter.  What are you going to do? What do you think? I don't know how I feel about that.  He's murdered four innocent people and he killed Zach Hamilton.  He's my son.  There's nothing you can do for him.  I can try putting him back into a safe facility where he can't hurt himself or anyone else.  I'm not going to let you kill him.  I'm sorry.  You brought me into this.  I didn't know who he was then.  Try and understand, my youngest son is gone forever.  Maybe I have a second chance with Daniel.  You really believe that? You have a son.  Wouldn't you believe it? This second chance she wants could get us both killed.  For her own sake, I have to tell her what she wants to hear.  Fine, we'll do it your way.  Just Help me find him.  Is there a way to reach out to him? I don't know.  Think.  The Mama Cass song that he left playing in your apartment What about it? One of the few happy memories I have with Daniel as a boy was, every Saturday, I'd take him to the King's Bay Cafe in the marina.  There was a juke box there.  And Daniel would always play that song.  Maybe it's more than a happy memory.  Maybe it's an invitation.  King's Bay Cafe.  It's still there.  Saxon's been one step ahead of us this whole time.  We know he stole your computer files.  But how could he have known about Zach Hamilton? We met him after that.  The detailed notes you keep on your computer Yes? I think Saxon's been monitoring your laptop.  It wouldn't be hard.  You just need the right spyware.  We can use this.  Write an entry in your journal saying you're going to King's Bay Cafe tomorrow morning.  You think he'll read it and go? You said yourself he's been trying to send you a message.  He wants to see you.  I don't like deceiving Vogel, but if it's the only way to get to Saxon You had no choice, Dex.  You had to lie to her.  I just can't believe Vogel still thinks her son can be helped.  Well, it's not that crazy.  After everything he's done.  You would want to help Harrison, wouldn't you? Vogel pretty much made the same point.  She's right.  I mean, look at what your own father did to protect you.  Right or not, Saxon needs to be stopped.  I'm putting him on my table.  And how is Vogel going to feel about that? I can't worry about it now.  At least she'll be alive.  Well, you'll figure it out.  I'm glad you're here.  I wanna be able to keep being here for you, Dex.  But? But there's no life for me here in Florida, we both know it.  I can have a life somewhere else far away from here.  In Argentina.  Maybe we all can.  You and Harrison could meet me there.  We can start over.  It would be hard on Harrison, uproot his whole life.  At first, it might be, but sometimes change is a good thing.  Sometimes it can   Yes.  Me, you, and Harrison.  We're gonna move to Argentina.  We'll make it work, Dex.  I can give my notice at Miami Metro, say I'm burnt out.  I'm taking Harrison to travel for a while.  Only Debra will know the truth.  Lieutenant.  Have you heard anything on the whereabouts of Zach Hamilton? Zach Hamilton? You made it pretty clear that we back away from him.  I just got a call from his parents.  They haven't heard from him in days.  Did they file a missing persons report? They just did.  Look, in case he does turn up, I wanna be the first to know.  I'll make sure of it.  Deb, thanks for coming in.  Yeah.  What's up? Welcome back to Homicide, detective.  You'll earn your way back up.  You don't know how happy this makes me.  Like the family coming together again.  We gotta celebrate.  Yeah.  What? It's all happening so fast.  And? Would you rather it happened slow? I just need some time to think about it.  What's to think about? Thought this is what you wanted? It is.  I mean, I thought it was.  I don't get it.  I just need a little time, you know? Take all the time you need.  Hey.  Hold on to this.  Hey.  Heh.  I, uh, tried getting in touch with Saxon, but he's not answering his phone.  Went by his place.  He cleared out.  Shit.  Yeah.  At least we're on the right track.  Yeah.  Good luck with that.  Deb.  I, uh, wouldn't have gotten this far without you.  I'm glad I could help.  You cleaned.  A little.  Well, I hope I can still find shit.  I used to know where everything was.  Hungry? Are you kidding? Totally fair.  Well, I am gonna eat, and I made enough for you too.  You going back? How the fuck can I go back? My brother's a serial killer.  And I have another one hiding out in my house, eating salad.  Sorry.  It was stupid to think that I could go back.  Well, I know a lot about wanting things that you can't have.  I wish somewhere I'd learned to take \"no\" for an answer.  Would have made my life a lot easier.  But you didn't.  I'll take that one.  Right.  Well, it's just who I am.  And, uh Something tells me you might be the same way.  Maybe that's the one thing we have in common.  Heh.  I can't believe I'm eating food you made.  It's not bad, though, right? No.  All right, two minute warning, Harrison.  Swim lessons are calling.  Almost done.  Sorry about this police protection business.  No, it's good.  I'm actually glad that they're here.  If Hannah were to stop by, poor Harrison would probably run right to her.  He's not the only one.  Dexter, hope I'm not intruding.  No, not at all.  Come in.  All right.  What can I do for you? Checking in, making sure everything's okay.  Yeah, everything's fine.  Well, good to hear.  I'm thinking the Hannah McKay threat has pretty much died down.  Oh, yeah? I mean, if she was here I'm sure she's gone.  I'll recommend we pull off your protective detail.  Okay.  All right.  And what's your name? Harrison.  Harrison.  Huh.  Is this your family? Mm hm.  Is this your daddy? That's you, right? Mm hm.  Now, who's the pretty lady? That's my mom.  Your mom? Hey, why don't you go grab your towel, bud.  Swim time.  Come on, let's go, little shark man.  He lost his mother when he was a baby, drawing her helps him feel closer to her.  Sure.  Well, we really do need to get going.  Thanks for checking in.  All right, take care.  Hey, you got a sec? Sure.  Closing the door.  That's never a good sign.  Hannah McKay dated your brother? You didn't think to mention that to me at all? Never crossed your mind? I didn't think it was important.  What else are you not telling me? I don't know, but if I told you   Drop the bullshit, Morgan.  What happened in the Keys? You see her? No.  I don't believe you.  You either saw her or your brother told you to lay off.  What if he did? What does it matter? I'll give you 250,000 reasons why.  But clearly we have different priorities.  My brother? We do.  After all I've done for you, I find it hard to believe you could do this.  And maybe you need to ask yourself if this is the right job for you.  And if not, why don't you get the fuck out.  Because I could use the office space for somebody that gives a shit.  Oh, Dexter.  Sorry, I know I'm early.  I'd make you coffee, but I only have tea.  That'll do.  I warn you, it's strong.  I need all the help I can get this morning.  Thanks.  Just so we're clear, I'm meeting up with Daniel and I'll lead him out of the cafe, where you will sedate him.  And then we'll take him to a facility.  Every time I close my eyes, I still see his face.  Daniel.  Yes.  Now to learn that he's alive is so difficult to accept.  It is hard to believe.  But another part of me knows it's true.  And I'm going to see him.  My son.  My little boy.  He still exists.  No matter what he's done.  Unh.  I thought one of Hannah's potions would be gentler than my needle.  Now Vogel will never have to face what her son has become.  Can I get a cup of coffee please? I'll bring that right over.  Here you go.    Hey, Lucy.    Hi.  He's played that song three times.  When is he gonna give up? I'll follow him until I find a quiet place to grab him.  For Vogel's own good, it's time I kill the messenger.  Saxon must have spotted you.  He's good at this.  He might think Vogel sent you, Dexter.  He could be going to her house right now.  You've reached Dr.  Evelyn Vogel.  I'm not available at this time.  Please leave a message.  Evelyn! You drugged me.  You have every right to be upset, but I was trying to protect you.  Where's Daniel? He got away.  That's why I'm here, to warn you.  Well, I consider myself warned.  And I think it best from here on out that I handle this myself.  It's not safe.  Or smart.  I appreciate your concern and I'm grateful for everything you've done.  But this is a family matter.  You once called yourself my spiritual mother.  Doesn't that make us family? Well, after what happened this morning, Dexter, how can I trust you? Well, trust me or not, I'm going to take care of Daniel.  Your safety and mine depend on it.  And after that, I'm on my way with Hannah.  On your way? Leaving Miami with her.  We're going away with Harrison.  That won't end well.  And you trusting Daniel, that he's not gonna hurt anyone again? How will that end? Leave this alone, Dexter.  Vogel thinks I'm unique, caught between two worlds, my humanity and my darkness.  Maybe I always will be, but I can't imagine a life without Hannah in either one.  After this morning, I won't have to.  Vogel is on her own, and so am I.  I'll kill Saxon and leave Miami forever.  So now do you believe me? Yes.  You didn't send him.  Are you hungry? How about a little breakfast? Okay Mom.      Previous EpisodeNext Episode"

        "script": "Previously on Dexter: If I do happen to find her, you'll get your reward money.  Ah, shit.  Who's that? Federal marshal.  Dexter Morgan, what the hell are you doing here? Arlene's a friend.  We met through Hannah.  It's not safe for you to go back to the hotel.  You need something private.  What the fuck? It's only for a couple of nights.  Couple of nights? That's it.  Sorry I'm not Deb.  She's always accusing me of comparing you to her.  Welcome back to Homicide, detective.  I just need some time to think about it.  Take all the time you need.  There's no life for me here in Florida.  I can have a life somewhere else far away from here   In Argentina.  Maybe we all can.  Yes.  Me, you, and Harrison are gonna move to Argentina.  Zach's killer is related to you.  The Brain Surgeon is related to you.  I had two sons, Daniel and Richard.  My older son, Daniel He killed Richard.  Then we put Daniel into a mental health institute.  That guy Cassie was dating Daniel Vogel is Oliver Saxon.  Suppose you do find him, Dexter.  What are you going to do? He's murdered four innocent people, and he killed Zach Hamilton.  He's my son.  He got away.  That's why I'm here, to warn you.  I think it best, from here on out, that I handle this myself.  Vogel is on her own, and so am I.  I'll kill Saxon and leave Miami forever.  So now do you believe me? Yes.  Feels good to cook for you again.  It reminds me of what it was like to be your mother.  You think fixing breakfast makes you my mother again? No.  You gave up that privilege a long time ago.  Daniel, whatever mistakes I've made in the past, I want to make it up to you.  I can help you.  Help me how? I can arrange for the care you need.  The care I need? I will never be locked up again.  I have contacts at the best facilities.  Like the last one you sent me to? Do you know what that was like? Day after day wondering when you'd finally come to visit, only to realise that the answer was never.  Daniel, I couldn't.  You'd killed Richard.  That was your fault.  You ignored me.  All you ever cared about was Richard.  You never tried to help me.  I was young, inexperienced.  I didn't know how to help you.  But you sure as hell knew how to help Dexter Morgan.  You taught him how to deal with his condition.  You gave him everything you denied me.  While I was rotting away, you gave him a life.  I know that.  I do.  It was a horrible mistake.  I was your son.  I needed you.  Please Please what? Let me help you.  I'm sorry for everything I've done.  I truly, truly am.  I wish I could believe you.  Hannah.  Hey, Harrison.  Oh, I missed you.  Aw.  Hey, soon you'll be able to spend all the time you want with her, but right now, Hannah and I need to have a grown up talk.  Okay, bud? Okay.  So some potentially good news.  Yeah? Deputy Marshal Clayton stopped by my place.  It seems like he's backing off on his search for you.  Oh, that's a huge relief.  Even so, he managed to get your face all over the news.  You still need to lay low.  So how am I gonna get out of Miami? Well, no one's looking for a woman travelling with her husband and child.  I'm thinking the three of us could leave together.  I like the sound of that.  There's still so much to do.  I've gotta tell Batista I'm leaving, get Harrison out of school, see Astor and Cody one last time.  I need to list my condo, sell my boat, my car.  Deb can help out with all that stuff.  Wow.  Heh, heh.  We're really gonna do it.  Yeah.  We're moving to Argentina.  God, that was always such a fantasy, I never thought that it would actually happen.  Otherwise I would have learned Spanish.  We'll learn together.  We'll be leaving soon.  I have to kill Saxon first.  Oh, so you are gonna go through with it.  I have to.  Vogel's not thinking clearly.  She doesn't seem to realise she's in danger.  I feel like I need to protect her.  You feel like you need to? Yeah.  What? Oh, it's just when it comes to you and killing, feelings never enter the equation.  She needs me to protect her.  Hey! Stay off Aunt Deb's treadmill.  But it's fun.  No, it's not for kids.  Hey, come here.  I wanna hear about what you've been doing for the last eight months.  Okay.  Hi, Aunt Deb.  Hi.  Come on.  Can we talk? What the hell is Harrison doing with Hannah? Deputy marshal pulled off the detail.  It's not safe for Harrison to be at the apartment as long as Saxon's still out there.  Okay, then I'll watch him, but he shouldn't be with her.  That's not fucking fair to him.  I have to tell you something.  What? Harrison and I are leaving soon.  What do you mean, you're leaving? You're leaving where? Leaving Miami with Hannah.  What are you talking about? We're moving to Argentina.  Are you kidding? You know how stupid that sounds? Deb   You're gonna take your fucking son, move to another country with a wanted fugitive? Have you fucking thought this through? Deb, I have.  We wanna have a life together.  I wish there was a different way, but there's not.  We need to leave the country and start someplace new.  You act like this doesn't even affect me.  I know it does.  Well, then, that's a really selfish decision on your part.  We'll still see each other.  I'll come up here, and you can visit.  Okay, I'll look you up the next time I'm in Argentina.  Deb, I'm sorry.  This is hard for me too.  Hey.  How was your day? Long.  Aww.  Well, I had a really good day.  Not only am I about to graduate, but I got a recruitment letter from Greenwood Academy.  A therapist position.  What's Greenwood Academy? It's a very well respected special needs school in Atlanta.  They want to set up an interview.  That's fucking great.  When you going? I'm not.  What do you mean? Why not? Joey, I'm not moving to Atlanta when you're here.  I'll find something in Miami.  I'm just so flattered that they're interested.  Jamie, I would feel like shit if I was the cause of you missing out on a great opportunity.  You shouldn't.  This is my decision.  All I'm saying is, you know, you should do what's best for your career.  What about us? Don't worry about us, you know? We'll make it work.  Be right back.  I'm gonna go grab a drink.  Evelyn.  Tom.  Please.  Everything okay? Yes, fine.  A little over worked, so Mm.  Thanks for coming in this morning.  As I said, it's kind of a sensitive matter.  It's about one of your patients.  Zach Hamilton.  As I'm sure you're aware, he's gone missing.  Yes.  I was hoping he'd turned up by now.  He hasn't.  And I promised his parents that I would look into it personally.  But I'm afraid I've hit a dead end.  Tom, you know that I'm not at liberty to discuss my patients.  Come on, Evelyn, I'm trying to help this kid.  Now, he lived at home.  How was his relationship with his parents? Like anyone his age.  Did he say anything about trying to get away? He talk about any friends, maybe a special girl? Was he into drugs? Gambling? Was he suicidal? I don't know.  Look, I know you understand better than anyone what it's like to lose a child.  Not knowing is even worse.  Imagine how the Hamiltons must feel.  I wish I could help, but I just don't know any more.  I'm sorry, but I have another appointment.  Saxon killed his brother when he was only 14.  Killed seven more in the fire when he was 17.  How many more since then? He's lived in a dozen cities across two continents.  Never been arrested.  Never leaves a trace.  Is he the perfect psychopath I once was? Dr.  Vogel.  Dexter.  Can we talk? What are you doing here? Tom wanted to question me about Zach.  Well, of course, I couldn't tell him anything.  But I feel horrid keeping Zach's death from the Hamiltons.  And we both know that Zach's killer is still out there.  Understand, Evelyn, you are in danger.  Well, you don't have to worry.  My son isn't gonna harm me.  How do you know that? I just do.  Have you been in contact with him? I saw him.  When? We had breakfast yesterday.  Where is he now? I have no idea.  Evelyn It's the truth.  He   He was angry and he stormed out of the house.  I don't know whether I'll ever see him again.  Why didn't you tell me? Because you want to kill him.  And I don't want that to happen.  I can't turn my back on him again.  What is there you can do for him? Well First, I can establish trust.  I wasn't a good mother to him when he was a child.  I need to win him over.  And then Well, eventually, hopefully, I'll get him back into a facility.  And how many more innocent people will he kill before you do that, before he kills you? If you won't protect yourself, I need to do it.  I don't want you to protect me, Dexter.  I don't want you to be a hero.  Evelyn, I have to   Please.  Don't use me as an excuse for killing Daniel.  She doesn't want my help.  So do I just walk away from this? We could leave for Argentina tonight.  Dexter, you don't want to leave this unfinished.  I don't even know how to find him.  You always find a way.  If you don't kill Saxon, her life is at risk.  Crime scene.  You can send it back, you know.  It's not the salad.  So you asked me here to watch me eat? You can't tell anybody this, okay? Dexter is leaving Miami.  Why? He's quitting? He and Harrison are gonna take the rest of the year and travel.  Fucking A.  Good for him.  Or not.  I don't know if he's ever coming back, you know.  I mean, I get wanting a change, but   Sometimes, you know, when things don't feel right, changing it up is better for everyone involved.  It's not better for me.  He's my brother.  I don't want him to leave.  I understand, but maybe you should think about what's best for him.  Look, when I left New York, it was one of the toughest things I ever did, leaving my friends and family.  But as it turns out, finally being on my own was the best thing I ever did for myself.  Batista gave me my badge back.  Fucking A, that's great.  Or not.  It's good.  It's good.  I've wanted to come back for a long time, so You tell Elway? Not yet.  You know what this means, right? You and me, side by side.  Just like old times.  Seriously? Yeah.  It's a crime scene.  Gotta go.  No, I got it, I got it.  Okay.  Next one's on me, partner.  Nothing will change after I'm gone.  Blood will continue to pool.  I just won't be here to photograph it.  The guy was hit pretty hard.  Major head wounds, lots of broken bones, internal injuries.  Road rage.  The guy on the bike wouldn't get out of the way, gave him the finger, so the driver ran him over.  Lieutenant, can I get a word? Sure.  Hey, Dex.  I didn't know I had to work today.  Why would you think that? Because it's Saturday.  Are you high? You're high, aren't you? I can smell it on you.  Go home.  Dad We'll talk about this later.  Go.  And stop smoking pot.  You have every right to tell me what to do at work, but you have no right to tell me what to do at home.  Well, that's   That's a huge shock, Dexter.  I know it seems like it's out of the blue, but after Rita's death and with the job, I've just had enough death in my life for a while.  I need a break, so This is my notice.  You need this, don't you? I wish you nothing but the best.  Thank you.  I'd like to keep this between us.  I'd like to let other people know myself, Jamie included.  She's gonna take it hard.  You know, she really loves Harrison.  He loves her too.  Anyway, she's moving on herself.  New job soon.  Maybe this'll make it easier.  I'll miss you, bro.  Hey, listen, and If you change your mind, you always have a home here.  Got it.  Okay.  He said, \"I'm too big for a nap,\" and then he went right to sleep.  Heh.  Cute.  So are you any closer in your search for Saxon? Not really.  I don't know much about him.  He moves around a lot.  I guess he figures if you stay in one place too long Eventually you get caught.  I wish we could just leave.  Yeah, me too, but I know that you have to protect Dr.  Vogel.  Actually, she doesn't want me to.  Then why are you doing this? Because it's what I do.  It's who I am.  It's all I know.  Dexter, you're more than that.  Am I? You think that when we move to Argentina that it's possible for you and me to have a fresh start? Yes.  Well, then, the sooner you kill Saxon, the sooner we can get there.  Vogel is the key.  I'm sure he'll go for her.  But I can't just sit and watch her.  Especially if she figures out that you're watching her.  That can make things worse.  I need to find him, but maybe I don't need Vogel.  Just her computer.  I want you to see something.  Get in.  I'm not gonna hurt you, Mom.  Trust me, if I wanted you dead, I wouldn't be holding this door.  Do you recognise this from the video I sent you? This is where you kill your victims.  Why did you bring me here? To help you understand.  Have a seat.  Don't worry, I wiped it down after every, uh   Well This room is more than what you think it is.  It's a reminder.  Of what? Where you sent me.  I've made it look exactly like what they called our treatment room.  When I would refuse to take my meds, the doctors would strap me down into a chair like this and they would force the meds down.  And that was usually the highlight of my day.  You can see why I caused that fire.  I can see why you would do anything to get out of a place like this.  You said before that you wanted to help me.  Yes.  I'd like that.  Most facilities aren't like this, Daniel.  I could put you someplace where you'd be very comfortable.  I could see you every day.  I want you to help me like you helped Dexter.  I want you to show me how to exist free in the world just the way I am.  As a killer? Daniel, I can't help you to murder innocent people.  If you care about me the way you say you do, you'll figure out a way to make this work.  I want to be someone you can love.  I'm asking you, as your son please help me.  All right, I'll find a way.  What about Dexter? He's still after me.  I'll talk to Dexter.  Don't make the same mistake you made with Richard.  Choose right this time.  Choose me.  I'll get Dexter to understand.  Do you think that's possible? I'll make it possible.  I want this, Daniel.  I want to be your mother again.  I'll do whatever it takes.  Vogel told me where she keeps a spare key in case of an emergency.  I think protecting her from her deranged son qualifies.  Saxon installed spyware on her computer.  Thing is, that can go both ways.  So if Saxon can see Vogel's computer Then I can see Saxon's.  So, what are you looking for? Something, anything that can give me an edge.  What's this? That's the video he sent to Vogel.  And this one's from last week.  No, don't! Zach.  No, no! What are you doing? No! No! No! Dexter, if something happens to Evelyn, it will haunt you forever.  You can't just run off to Argentina and escape who you are.  I'm not trying to escape anything.  So you'll post a job listing next week? Great.  Listen, I just don't need any forensic tech.  Hey, I need the best out there.  He's filling some big shoes.  I appreciate it.  Sorry, deputy.  How can I help you? Just came by to let you know none of our leads on Hannah McKay panned out.  You know, when the trail goes cold at this point, the subject either was never here, or skipped town pretty fast.  So, what does that mean? It means the case is back to low priority.  Okay.  Thanks for the heads up.  Uh   I couldn't help overhearing.  You said you're looking for a new forensic tech.  You know someone? No, I'm just curious   Who's leaving? It's not Dexter Morgan, is it? Close the door.  He hasn't told any of his friends yet, so this is on the QT, but, yes, Dexter's moving on.  He got a better job, huh? No, he's going to travel, spend time with his son.  Really? Yeah.  I can't say I blame him.  Hey, babe.  How was your day? It was okay.  You working? Yeah, I'm just sending out r\u00c3\u00a9sum\u00c3\u00a9s.  I'm almost done though.  Hey, um, can we talk for a sec? Okay.  I feel like an asshole, but I gotta be honest with you.  Okay, so be honest.  It's not working out between us, is it? Is that a question? No.  It's   I'm sorry.  Then why did you let me move in here? I mean, why wait until now, Joey? I hoped it would make things better.  I don't know what else to say.  Ugh, I am so stupid to think you would ever get over Deb.  It's got nothing to do with Deb.  I thought you wanted to be honest with me.  I am.  This is on me.  She's got nothing to do with it.  Joey, see, that is what hurts the most.  That you just keep lying about it.  I'm not lying, Jamie.  Okay, you know what? Don't worry.  I'm gonna move my stuff out of here as soon as I can, so you're free to not go back to Deb.  Jamie   Bye.  Just give me a sec.  Hey.  I don't want to intrude.  Well, it's your house.  It's your family.  It's your family too.  I want you and Harrison to be happy.  So how do you feel about us leaving? Scared.  My whole family's moving.  Scared? You've always been there.  I don't know what my life looks like without you.  Well, maybe it looks better.  Really? Hanging out with two serial killers, does it get better than that? So you see my point.  I don't know.  Better or worse you've always been there.  Moving on without you feels like jumping off a cliff.  I know what you mean.  Come on.  Will you? Hey, look who's here.  Hi.  Hi.  Just checking in.  All is well here.  Harrison's playing outside with Deb.  Oh, good.  You doing okay? Yeah, I just wanted to hear your voice.  I have to go.  Evelyn.  Dexter.  I was hoping we could talk.  Okay.  I've been rethinking what I said earlier, and I fear I was being too judgemental.  I think it's possible that you and Hannah could have a relationship.  Really? And I think moving far away, beginning anew might be the best thing for you.  Moving far away? Is that the important part? You mentioned Argentina? That could be a good place.  Why do you want me to leave? Dexter, I think there's hope for Daniel.  I don't think he likes killing.  I could help him, but I'm not gonna get that chance if you kill him.  So just leave, please.  Leave Miami.  You don't think he likes killing? He says he wants my help.  Let me show you how much he doesn't like killing.  No, don't! No! No.  That's Zach's head he's sawing into.  There's no hope for him, Evelyn.  This is the same person who killed your younger son.  He will never change.  Don't.  I'm sorry.  So, what now? You know what needs to happen.  Otherwise, he'll go on killing.  Where is he now? He said he would call me tonight.  Set up a meeting with him tonight.  Someplace public, safe.  Call me and let me know where.  I'll follow him and take it from there.  Just please don't let him suffer.  I won't.  Debra Morgan.  Do I know you? Deputy U. S.  Marshal Max Clayton.  And this is Harrison.  Hey, buddy.  Hi.  You guys have met? Over at his dad's, yeah.  Harrison, why don't you go inside? I'll be there in a minute.  Okay.  Elway gave me your address.  I thought it better we talk in person.  Okay.  Look, I'm worried about your brother.  Dexter? Why? It's probably nothing, but it just struck me as odd that he's leaving town at the exact time Hannah McKay is rumoured to be here.  How do you know he's leaving? Uh, overheard at the station.  Maybe it's nothing, but are he and Arlene Shram a couple? I don't know.  I don't keep up with his dating life.  Okay, it's just I know he used to have a relationship with Hannah McKay.  What if he still does? Then he's a fucking idiot.  That's what I'm afraid of.  Look, I know I'm going out on a limb here, but what if these two somehow reconnected? I mean, his life could be at risk.  His son's too.  Dexter wouldn't do that.  I hope not.  I don't need to tell you what a dangerous person Hannah McKay is.  You know more about her than I do.  If Dexter were dating Hannah McKay, I would fucking know about it.  Maybe he'd keep it from you.  Who knows? I mean, men do stupid things for beautiful women.  Logic just flies out the window.  Well, I appreciate your concern, but that's not what's happening here.  Dexter's burned out, that's why he's leaving.  Okay.  Thank you.  I respect your opinion.  Here's my card.  You call me if you think of anything.  Okay, I will do.  Hey.  You guys hungry? Yea h! Hey, go clean up, Harrison.  Is everything okay? Not really.  Something happen? Deputy Marshal Clayton happened.  He was just questioning me on the beach.  I thought that Dexter said that Clayton was backing off.  Somehow he found out that Dexter's leaving, and it tweaked him.  He thinks Dexter's helping you hide.  Oh, God.  I covered for both of you, but you have got to stay hidden until you leave.  Of course.  Yes.  Oh Thank you for protecting me, again.  Who knew I'd be so good at it? We'll all be out of here soon.  I know.  I have lunch.  No, thanks.  I have someplace I need to be.  Hey.  Hey.  Can we talk? Nothing to talk about.  I know why you're here.  I'll have your last cheque drawn.  I was gonna give you two weeks.  Don't want your two weeks.  I still have friends in Miami Metro, they said you were going back.  Well, shouldn't we talk about this? I went out of my way to make this work.  I put up with your bullshit.  The more I gave, the more you pushed back.  It's quite clear to me that it was never gonna work out.  Well, I'm sorry.  I really appreciate the job and everything that you've done for me.  Don't mention it.  Let's just, uh Okay.  I'm gonna go pack up my office.  I'll have security do that.  They'll deliver it to your house.  And all the case files are mine, of course.  Including those on Hannah McKay.  Good luck to you.  Yeah, you too.  Harrison, remember what your dad said.  That's not a toy.  But Aunt Deb does it all the time.  Harrison, please listen.  I am.  Ow! Harrison! Ow! Ow! Ow! I know.  It's gonna be okay.  Ow.  I know it hurts.  I know it hurts.  It's gonna be okay.  Okay.  Ow.  Here, hold that.  Ouch.  Ow.  Dexter Morgan.  Dexter, call me.  We're gonna have to take you somewhere and get you patched up.  What happened? He fell and hit his chin.  It's a pretty deep cut.  It won't stop bleeding.  I'll let the doctor know.  Are you the mother? Are you the mother? Uh, yes.  I'm just waiting for his father to call me back.  Fill this out.  Okay.  And wait for us to call his name.  Okay.  Thank you.  Harrison, you're being so brave.  I can't wait to tell your dad.  Harrison Morgan? Uh, yeah.  Here.  Been a while since we've been here.  Choir director.  Long time ago.  Saxon's first victim.  And his last victims.  It's also been a while since you've used victims' pictures.  He needs to see what he's done.  That was always very important to you.  People get what they deserve.  At least they should.  Huh.  I've come a long way.  It feels like I'm a different person from the last time I was in this room.  You're still you, Dexter.  I hope you realise that.  Why wouldn't I? I just don't want you to have any unrealistic expectations about whatever happens next.  I know exactly what happens next.  I kill Saxon.  And then Hannah and Harrison and I get on a plane and start our new lives.  Hey, Jamie.  Go fuck yourself.  What? Debra, come on in.  I'm ready to come back, if you'll have me.  If I'll have you? Are you sure about this? You're not fooling me? Uh, I don't think so.  Well, in that case, hallelujah.  Can you start today? I was thinking more like a week or two.  Of course.  Loose ends.  Yeah, something like that.  Mm hm.  Well, whenever you're ready, I'm ready.  It's funny, though.  What? You coming back as Dexter's leaving.  He told you? Yeah.  And, yeah, don't worry about Jamie.  What was that? Oh, you don't know? Quinn just ended things with her.  Stupid idiot.  He did? And so you know, Jamie kind of blames you.  Yeah, I get that.  Yeah, she thinks Quinn is still in love with you or something like that.  I didn't want to know the details.  I'll let you have at him first.  We need to talk.  I just did what   Not here.  Did you break up with her because of me? No.  Yes.  I mean, no and yes.  Don't get all mad.  Your face gets red when you get mad.  No, it doesn't.  What the fuck happened? It's not complicated.  I wasn't happy.  I mean, I was okay, but I kind of knew I was never gonna marry her.  Probably would have ended it soon anyway, even if what happened between you and I didn't happen.  Nothing happened.  We shared a kiss.  That's not a reason to fucking break up with somebody.  You're not hearing me.  I probably would have broke up with Jamie, but what happened between you and I just made it clear that I shouldn't be with her anymore.  Got it? Yes.  So, yeah, to be completely honest, I still have feelings for you, But I don't expect anything from you.  Why not? Because I didn't think you wanted   I still have feelings for you, stupid.  That didn't change, I just   I wasn't sure that I saw a future for us.  What about now? I don't know.  I mean, I used to I used to feel like something was holding me back, but now   Now I just   Shh.  Are you sure it was Hannah McKay you saw earlier today? Yeah.  I'd seen her picture on the news.  She brought in her son.  He had a cut on his chin.  Hannah McKay doesn't have any children.  Are you sure this is her? Well, I think so.  What was her boy's name? His name was Harrison Morgan, and she sure acted like he was her own.  I fell on my chin.  Yeah, how many stitches are holding that chin together? Six.  Wow.  I bet that hurt.  Yeah, but Harrison was very brave.  I even got a lollipop.  Can I go play now? Yeah, sure.  Thanks for taking care of him.  Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.  I feel awful.  I can't believe I wasn't here for you.  You went out in public.  You put yourself in jeopardy because I was setting up a kill room.  Dex, you didn't know.  It doesn't matter.  I'm trying to save Dr.  Vogel when I should be taking care of you and Harrison.  We're okay, really.  It's fine.  But there is one other thing.  What? That deputy marshal came by.  Here? He talked to Deb.  I think she put him off, but still, we can't stay here for much longer.  I know.  Evelyn? Dexter, he's here.  Here? Where's here? At my house.  He called me.  Said he was a couple of blocks away.  No, that wasn't the plan.  You were supposed to meet him someplace in public.  Someplace safe.  It's the last time I'm ever going to see him.  I wanted a private goodbye.  It's not a good idea.  That's him now.  Evelyn? What? I have to go.  Well, be careful.  I will.  Dexter, go.  What if the marshal comes back? He's not coming back.  It's Evelyn who needs you right now.  I should stay here with Hannah.  This is exactly what Vogel warned you about.  You're trying to live in two different worlds, and it's got you paralysed.  I'm not paralysed.  I'm making a choice.  Son, you're choosing to be afraid, because for the first time in your life, you think you've got something to lose.  Is that who you wanna be? Oh.  That's all right.  I'll do it.  I'm getting old.  My aim isn't as good as it used to be.  Why'd you want to see me tonight? I just thought it would be nice for us to talk about normal things.  Unlike the other couple of times.  Mm.  Of course.  What's wrong? Wrong? You seem tense.  No.  No, not at all.  I'm very comfortable.  Maybe a little tired, under the circumstances.  Is there something you want to tell me? I just wanted to see you.  Heh.  Guess I'm sounding like a mother already constantly wanting her son around.  You know when you see as many people die as I have, you know when they're afraid.  What are you afraid of, Mother? He's still here.  Hello, Dexter.  What do you want? Where   Don't move.  I want to show you something.  Don't touch her.  Mother chose the wrong son, again.  Evelyn? Oh, no, no, no.  No       Previous EpisodeNext Episode"

        "script": "Previously on Dexter: Harrison and I are leaving Miami with Hannah.  You act like this doesn't even affect me.  You can visit.  I'll look you up the next time I'm in Argentina.  So you any closer in your search for Saxon? I wish we could just leave.  I still have feelings for you.  I used to feel like something was holding me back.    Now?   Now, I   I want you to help me like you helped Dexter.    I'll find a way.    What about Dexter? He's still after me.  I'll talk to Dexter.  You don't think he likes killing.  Let me show you how much he doesn't like killing.  No! That's Zach's head he's sawing into.  I'd like to be a part of the team on this one.  Thanks, but the Marshal Service doesn't take on partners.  Looking for a new forensic tech?   Dexter's moving on.    Really? It just struck me as odd that he's leaving town at the same time Hannah McKay is rumoured to be here.  If Dexter were dating Hannah McKay, I would know about it.  Deputy Marshal Clayton thinks Dexter's hiding you.  Oh, God.    What happened?   He fell and hit his chin.  It's a deep cut.  It won't stop bleeding.  Hello, Dexter.  Mother chose the wrong son.  Evelyn? Vogel warned me I've been straddling two worlds and I ignored her.  For that, she paid the price with her life.  Now I have to remove myself from her life.  I never imagined the last homicide I'd work would be one I'm now a part of.  I have to call this in.  I can't be seen leaving the scene of the crime.  The last time I was in a pool of my mother's blood I was too young to do anything about it.  But I'm no longer a child.  She didn't say why she wanted me to stop by.  The two of you were friends? Your father knew her, right? Yeah, she reached out to both Deb and me.  She was a good person.  So you pull up to the house.    You see the door kicked in     And I ran in.  That's when I found her.  You moved the body? Yes.  I tried to stem the bleeding, but she was already gone.  Did you see anybody suspicious? Miller was talking to the neighbours.  One of them saw a white male in his 40s take off in a white or grey pickup.    Which is it?   It was dark.  That's the best they could make out.  Give Miller a hand, and canvass the whole block.  Updates every half hour.  The media's gonna be all over this.  Okay.    You should go.    No, I can help.  Dex.  As much as I could use the hand a defence attorney would have a field day with a forensic tech who not only found a murder but knew the victim and then worked it.  We gotta protect the case here.  So I'll see you first thing in the morning.  Last day on the job.  Last day.    I should     Go.  We got this.  All right.  Saxon may have a head start, but I intend to catch up.  Jesus, what are you doing here so early? Is Harrison with Hannah? Yeah, she's helping him get dressed in my room.  That kid wakes before the fucking sun.  You all right? Evelyn's dead.  Saxon killed her last night in front of me.  He got away.    Fuck.    I wanted you to hear it from me.  Miami Metro is working the case.  It's all over the news.  Jesus Christ.  You all right?   Evelyn was   I know.  If it weren't for her   We might not have found our way back to each other.  If Saxon's out there Harrison needs to be with Jamie.  She's back at Batista's.  He'll be safe there.  Are you gonna go after Saxon? Yes.  Then I will too.  I'll call Batista.  I'll go back to work today.  She was important to me too, Dex.  You're putting yourself in the same position you've been trying to avoid.  Understand this: if I get Saxon my way, I'm not handing him over to you.  Daddy, I combed my hair.  I see that.  He insisted.  I think Jamie's gonna be really impressed.  Go grab your backpack.    She's waiting for us at the apartment.    I'll help you.  Don't tell her I already had a doughnut.    What's this?   I booked our itinerary.  The three of us fly to Rio.  When we get to South America we catch a flight to Buenos Aires.  And no one can trace us.  That's still the plan, right? Yeah.    But   What? Dr.  Vogel's dead.  Saxon killed her.  Oh, God.  I'm so sorry.  This doesn't change anything for us but I need to make sure it's taken care of before we leave.  You think you can take care of it that fast? Yes.  Two days left in Miami.  Two days to find Saxon.  Two days until I start a new life with Hannah.  Good news.  I already have five people coming by to see your place today.  That was fast.  Market's coming back.  And with a location like yours I wouldn't be surprised if we end up with five offers.  I really appreciate you taking the listing on such short notice, Syl.  Course.  I was happy to get the call.  Oh, Harrison's gotten so big.  Yeah.  So why the sudden move? Too many memories.  I understand.  After Miguel I downsized.  Focused on the kids.  Oh, make that six people coming by.  I should take this.  Okay.  You put monkey in a box.  Oh, sorry about that.  God, seeing your place all boxed up is making this so real.  You guys are really going.  Harrison is gonna miss you.  Monkey's gonna miss you too.  Hey, why don't you take Harrison overnight? Deb's place is so cramped, and people are gonna be in and out of here.  And that way, you can   Hug my favourite person in the whole wide world all night long! Stop! All right.    This one.    This one, oh.  Oh, yeah.  Looks pretty.  I'd like to get her inland before Laura hits.    Laura?   Tropical Storm Laura.  They say she'll make landfall in a few days.  She's a 2001 Century 2901 centre console.  I had this custom rail put in.  New paint.  Has a radar, GPS, fish finder, autopilot emergency life raft.  And I had these twin Yamaha 250 four stroke motors put in.  They got just over 400 hours and when you open them up and you're out there There's nothing like it.  Hoping she'd have a bigger beer cooler.  Well, maybe she's not the boat for you.  Saxon moves from city to city but his job never changes.  He inspects buildings.  It's a place to start.    Good morning.    Easy for you to say.  You didn't spend the night scouring Vogel's place with nothing to show for it except a big goose egg.  Nothing? See for yourself.  No prints, no trace.  Oh, man, I could go for some hookers and some blow right now.  But since this isn't the '90s, caffeine it is.    Want anything?   No, I'm good.  This hospital, closed for years.  Saxon issued a demolition permit, but it's still standing.  The perfect place to cut into your victims' skulls.  Hey, Dexter, Quinn is looking for you.    Because?   Oh, yeah.  The swab thing in the interrogation room.  Okay.  Dex, come in.  Hi, Dexter.  He came in to clear his name on the Cassie case.  I see.  I had no idea I was a suspect.  We got to your apartment, and it was totally cleaned out.  You can appreciate how that looks.  I couldn't stay at my old place.  I spent so much time there with Cassie.  Everywhere I looked, something reminded me of her.  You can understand that.  You knew Cassie.  She was a great person.  Yes, she was.  For a while I was even thinking of leaving Miami.  But my business is here my friends, family.  When I heard there was an alert out for me, I I couldn't believe it.  I thought we already resolved this.  We appreciate you coming in.  Like you said, I just wanna clear my name.  Good.  This will help towards that.  What's this?   DNA sample.    Is that really necessary?   You said you wanted to cooperate.    Open.  Thanks.  We're done here for now.  Hey, you plan on any more moves     I'll be sure to let you know.    Good.  Saxon was just here, trying to clear his name for Cassie's murder.  He had an answer for everything Quinn threw at him.  Well, he's got balls, I'll give him that.  Masuka find anything to tie him to Vogel's crime scene? He came up empty, but What?   Saxon agreed to a standard.    Well, so what? It's not gonna tie him to Cassie's murder.  But it'll give us a matri fucking lineal match to his mother.  Yeah, suddenly he's no longer Oliver Saxon.  He's Daniel Vogel, Dr.  Vogel's psychopathic son who died in a fire at a psychiatric hospital.  Let him try to explain that away with my boot up his ass.  Let me ask you a question.  Why are you helping us get Saxon? Don't you want him for yourself? I just want him taken care of.  Well, that's new coming from you.  I'm gonna go get started on this.  I'm gonna go find some pens.  Hi.  Your Thin Mints are in the bottom drawer.  It takes supply requisition like a week to come through, so   Right.    You mind? By all means, go ahead.  Thanks.  What the fuck is this? I kept it around just in case I decided to marry somebody else from work.  You've had this in here the whole time? Keep my stapler away from Soderquist.  Guy's a fucking klepto.  Is this old hospital Saxon's private sanatorium? Saxon's kill room.  Zach died here.  And who knows how many others? Doesn't look like Saxon's been living here.  But he'll be back.  This is clearly a special place for him.  You can stake out the building, wait for him.  I don't have time to wait.  Hannah and I don't have time to wait.    I want him dead.    By your hand.  Anyone's hand, as long as he's dead.  That doesn't sound like the old Dexter.  Maybe I'm not the old Dexter.  Everything Saxon downloaded about me from Vogel's computer is on this.  He recorded all his kills.  They're all here.  But you still don't know where he is.  Maybe this is exactly what I need.  I can bring him to me.  Hey.  You calling it quits soon? Yeah, I will soon.  I just wanna get up to speed on a couple things.  Going to Dr.  Vogel's memorial tomorrow? I know she helped you get through a lot.    Yeah, I'll be there.    Need a ride, let me know.  Swung by Elway's.  He said you were back on the force.  Yeah.  It's my first day back.  I'm kind of swamped.  What can I help you with, deputy marshal? I was hoping you could clear something up for me.    I'm just following up on a lead.    Shoot.  A blond woman matching Hannah McKay's description walked into urgent care with a young boy named Harrison Morgan said she was his mother.  The weird part is she gave your name and address.  My nephew's been staying with me since Dexter put his condo on the market.  He busted his chin, and I took him in to get him stitched up.  So you took him to urgent care? I told the woman at the desk I was his aunt, but maybe she didn't hear me.  Still, she looked at my photo of Hannah McKay and swore that's who brought him in.  Then she needs to get her fucking eyes checked because I haven't been blond since a very bad freshman year.  Right, okay.  Well, look, you know what it's like.  I gotta check out all the leads, even the crazy ones, right? Sure.  All right, welcome back, detective.  I'll be in touch.  I'll be here.  Not much turnout.  I guess she didn't have many family or friends.  Yeah, just the son who slit her throat.  Think Saxon's watching? I would be.  Thank you, everyone, for coming.  I know most of you didn't know Evelyn very well, but   It was a nice service.    Yeah.  It's important to remember those no longer with us.  Yeah.  Now, who wants a drink? Christ.  I'll be right back.  You know they're really gonna miss you, right? I know.  Maybe you should go in there and pretend you're gonna miss them too.  It's your last day, you know? It's no longer pretend.  Well, gain a Morgan, lose a Morgan.  Harry would have been proud of the two of you.  Thank you, sir.  I want you to know both of you have been like family to me.  And, Dexter, if you ever need anything or decide you wanna come back this will always be your home.  I appreciate that.  So let me buy you another round.    I should probably get going.    Oh, nonsense.  For the next six hours, you're still working for me.  You're not going anywhere.  That's an order.  Come on.  Okay, missy, what's your poison? I'll have a Diet Coke.  A beer for me.  Thanks.  Well, that's a little tame.  Really? Are you gonna go there? Well, if you put it that way, no.  Okay, you were all up in my shit about a bong rip but I don't know if you've noticed, but we're in a bar.  Look, I'm sorry about the whole pot thing.  You know, this whole father daughter thing is still kind of new, you know? Yeah, I know.  It's cool.  Everybody's really excited about your sister being back on the force.  Yeah, she told me that you two might be back in each other's lives.  You okay with that? Deb likes you, and with me gone I don't want her to be alone.  I want her to be with someone who makes her happy.  That's all I ever wanted to do.  I'm okay with that.  I gotta take this.    Hey, Syl, what's up?   Dex, I'm so glad I caught you.  I know it's last minute but I've got somebody who wants to see the place wants to meet the seller, and he's ready to make an offer, cash.    Give me half an hour.    Perfect.  You remember the first case we worked? Husband, wife, lots of blood.  I'd never seen anything like it.  The strings.  The look on your face.  You were like a pig in shit.  Thanks, I think.  Not sure what this place is gonna be like without you.  You're a good friend, Angel.  I'm glad to hear you say that.  So you'll forgive me for this.  All right, everybody! Everybody, come on, gather around.  Gather around.  I know that this is a solemn occasion.  But since somebody didn't let me throw him a party let's let this be it.  Dexter Morgan may be leaving the Miami Metro familia but he will always be right here in our hearts.  To Dexter.  We wish you and Harrison luck in whatever comes next.    To Dexter.    To Dexter.  Thank you.  Thank you.  I'll miss you guys too.  Dexter.  This is Oliver Saxon.  Again.  He responded to the listing and was hoping to take a look at the place.    Pleasure.    Likewise.  You'll have to excuse the mess.  No problem.  They say moving's one of the big causes of stress.  Almost as much as divorce.  And death.  Why don't you follow me? So it's a one bedroom, one bathroom, but it has an attached   Would you mind if Dexter showed me? I like to hear directly from the owner.  No sales pitch.  Sure.  I have a few phone calls to return.  I'll be outside.  I always did like this place.  You have the same view Cassie did.  What are you doing here? I have a proposal.  Figured the safest way to deliver it was to bring a referee.  I'm listening.  We walk away.    Walk away?   Both of us.  From each other.  Go our separate paths, live our separate lives.  I forget about you.  You forget about me.  You went out of your way to kill your mother in front of me and you just expect me to forget? May have been a little bit over the top but I was only trying to make a point.  I missed the point.  It was a test to see if, given the chance she would finally choose me.  Well, we both know how that turned out.  Yeah, so naturally, you had to cut her throat.  You know what it's like.  The kill.  It can be cathartic.  And it was.  That's why I'm giving you a choice.  Go on with your life, or come after me.  But choose poorly, like Mom and you will lose.  You seem pretty sure of yourself.  You have a lot more to lose than I do.  You've created the perfect cover life.  Cute little son, your sister.  Stepkids even.  And now you have a girlfriend.  It's Hannah, right? They're not a cover.  They're real to me.  Something Saxon can't understand.  All very lovely.  And all very easy to remove from your life.  I mean, you've already had one wife murdered.  That must be an interesting story.  But it's gonna put you in a very awkward position if everyone else starts disappearing from your life.  The choice is yours.  Yeah, I think I can live with that.  I'll let Mrs.  Prado know I've put an offer on the table.  He wants me to walk away without realising he's just reminded me why I can't.  So, what's so urgent? I've got a line on Hannah McKay, but I'm gonna need your help reeling her in.    I thought you didn't want my help.    Been looking at the wrong Morgan.  I think your former employee has her holed up in her place.  Deb is no fan of Hannah McKay.  Yeah, but you said she'd do anything for her brother.  Helping McKay is helping him.  I just need you to talk to her, take a look around.  Look, Deb and I didn't exactly part on the best of terms.  If you're still interested in that reward I suggest you find a way to patch things up with her.  Hey.  Just trying to make our last few days in Miami special, you know? I hope you like dolmas.  I'm just trying to keep myself busy.  You should go on one of those cooking shows.  The competition ones.  You'd win.  Oh, I'd make sure that I did.    It's Elway.    Bedroom.  What's up, Elway? Security left a couple of your personal items back in the office.  Just a couple pictures and a hat.  You didn't have to bring them over here.  I could've picked them up.  Well, I actually wanted to talk to you.    May I?   Actually, now is not a very good time.  It'll just take a minute.  I wanted to apologise about the way I behaved when you left.  Don't worry about it.  No, no, I was a real asshole.  I let my ego get the best of me, and I don't want to leave it like that.  I   Well, I want us to be friends, you know? Great.  Well, then we're good.  Now you're back on the force.  Maybe you and I can do each other the occasional favour.  Yeah, we'll keep in touch.  You   You expecting company? I sure am, and I actually need to get ready.  So I guess the police department is paying better than I remember.  Hey, Elway, I really appreciate that apology, but I've got a lot of shit to do.  Could you kindly get the fuck out of my house? Yeah.    He's gone, but he's onto you.    Oh, shit.  The deputy marshal won't be far behind.  You've gotta move fast.  Hello? Dex, we have a problem.  Elway was just here.    Elway?   He was dropping by to talk with Deb but she's sure he was looking for me.  She thinks that he knows that I'm here.  Stay there.  Okay.  I tried to get an earlier flight, but it's booked because of the storm.  I'm getting out of here right now.  She's gonna stay at a hotel near the airport until your flight.    Saxon came to my apartment.    What? Why the fuck didn't you call me? It happened very fast.  He said he wanted to offer me a truce.    A truce?   Really it was just a veiled threat.  He threatened you, Harrison, Astor and Cody, and you.  I can handle whatever he throws at me.    You should go with Hannah.    Yes.  I deposited my money into an offshore account.  We can access it immediately.  The storm coming is gonna ground all the flights.    Saxon isn't gonna follow us.    What if he does? I get it.  I get that this is something you feel like you have to do   this is who you are     It's not who I wanna be.  I have to do this first.  There's no other way.  I will be there.  I guess this is goodbye.  For now.  I can't not see my brother and my nephew.  Now you're a part of that package.  Well, not anything I ever saw coming.  For what it's worth, I think Dexter's making a mistake going after Saxon.  I think he should be here with you now.  Have you ever known him to be able to walk away from something once he's started it? That's life with Dexter.  That's who he is.  It's like having a whole other person in the relationship.  I must really love this man.  Me too.  Even when I don't want to.  Take care of them.  Yeah, I will.  Saxon wants to make Miami his home.  Little does he know how hot the summers can get.  And once everyone sees the footage of him as the Brain Surgeon the heat will be unbearable.  You know, he's not just gonna walk away from that.  Exactly.  I'm drawing him to me.  So I guess you're not gonna accept his offer.  Did you believe him, that he's willing to disengage? You clearly don't.  He came into my house and threatened my family.  Now you're sounding like the old Dexter again.  No, this is a different kind of kill.  Dead is dead, Dex.  It didn't used to matter who was on my table as long as someone was, but now   It's personal.  It's been personal for a long time.  And that need you used to feel? It's still there, somewhere.  But since Hannah came into my life it's lessened.  What I need is her.  So when you get to Argentina, what happens? I don't know.  But I can't wait to find out.  Sorry.  Dad said you were waiting for this DNA stuff? Tell your dad thanks.  It's so weird Masuka's your father.  Weird awesome.  You're not gonna fucking believe this.  Saxon is related to Vogel.  He's her son.  You're kidding me.  I thought all her family was dead.  You think this fucker killed his mother along with Cassie? What are you doing here? Starving.  Saxon's DNA came back, so they put out a warrant for his arrest.  Miami Metro knows that Saxon is Vogel's son and Elway and Clayton have no idea where Hannah is.  This is your last night in Miami, and we are having dinner together.  Even though you've already packed up your kitchen.  You wanna help me find a plate and some pans?   I'm really not hungry.    The next time we do this it's gonna be fucking tacos and tequila.  Or whatever the fuck they eat in Argentina.  Yeah, it'll probably be steaks.  It's Argentina, not Mexico.  Deb, you shouldn't be here.  Bullshit.  Do you remember where you put the pans? Listen to me.  You can't be here.  Why?   What the fuck is going on?   I'm expecting company.  Saxon.  Just leave him to me.  And I mean leave.  After everything you've been through, I don't want   Listen to me.  Nothing, and I mean nothing is gonna stand in the way of me having one more night with my brother.  Now, are you gonna help me find that fucking skillet or what? This place has been wiped clean.  Almost clean.  Look at this.  The last site someone visited on this computer was for an Aero Sudamerica.  Any specific details? Did she book a flight? If she did, it's not here.  But I'll tell you what I can do.  Access manifests for flights in the next few days cross check those names with passport photos.    Not exactly legal.    Are you saying don't do it? I'm not saying anything.  While you do whatever you're gonna do I'm gonna tail the Morgans, see if they'll lead me to her.  Done and done.  How are Astor and Cody doing with the move? They're better now that I told them they could come down for Christmas and that Astor could have my SUV.  You think you could drive it up to her? She asked about you.  Yeah, as soon as the storm passes.  They're saying it might turn into a hurricane.  It's one of the few things I won't miss about Florida.  God, this is such a mindfuck.  After tomorrow, you're not gonna be here.  What the fuck does that look like? We both start over.  Is that even possible? Yeah, I think so.  Don't you? It's just every fucked up   Every time I've been a complete mess, you've been there for me.  Even when it was your fault that I was fucked up you've never given up on me.  So if I can't make this work going back to being a cop again, then who the fuck is gonna help me pick up the pieces of that? You're not that person anymore.  You're stronger than that.  You're stronger than I'll ever be.  I'm not.  Deb, Dad and Vogel gave me the code so I'd know the right thing to do, but you've always just known.  It's the compass I always wished I had.  And as long as you listen to that you won't need me.  You'll be fine.  Maybe.  But don't ever think that it was the code that made you a good brother.  There's a human being in there.  There always has been.  Even if you can't see it.  Miami Metro is seeking the public's help in locating a local man, Oliver Saxon in connection with a string of grisly recordings that were recently obtained by Channel 8 News.  Miami   Did you help them recently obtain that footage? I needed him to be a wanted man and force his hand.  If he wants to take a last stab at me, now he has to do it tonight.  Which I why I need you to get out of here, Deb.  Please.  Bringing him in for questioning is still the department's top priority.  Miami Metro is seeking the public's help in locating a suspect, Oliver Saxon in connection with a string of gruesome videos.  The footage we received from this anonymous source details the extreme nature of the murders, allegedly committed by   Fucking Dexter.  Freeze, motherfucker.  I'll take it from here.  Thanks, Deb.  Welcome home.  I guess this means you've decided against the truce.  Yeah, I'm afraid so.  It's your own fault.  You should've walked away, left Miami when you could.  I like this place.  Miami's a great city.  I love the Cuban food.  Nice weather.  Murder solve rate at about 20 percent.  Yeah.  I understand.  There was a time I wasn't willing to leave either.  I didn't wanna give up anything.  Sounds like something's changed.  It has.  Your girlfriend? Yeah, that's part of it.  I've never been good at relationships.  Longest was a couple of weeks and she was chained to my radiator   so I guess that doesn't much count.    Not really, no.  Too much anger towards women, I suppose.  I can thank my mother for that.  No, that's all on you.  Well, I wish you luck.  Hope you don't stab her in the heart while she sleeps.  No, Oliver, I like her.  I love her.  I think about her all the time.  I'm thinking about her right now.  How I'd rather be with her than here with you.  What? This is usually my favourite moment the kill.  The moment before the kill, the kill itself the moment right after.  But now I don't even wanna be here.  I'm feeling a much stronger pull.  I don't need to kill you.  Then don't.  Walk away.  I will.  I guess I'll live to see another day.  Oh, no, you're still gonna die.  Just gonna be in the electric chair.  Hey, Deb, change of plans.  Dex.  Saxon's in here.  Arrest him.  Take him in.  Arrest him? He's still alive? Say you were looking into the buildings he was inspecting.  You subdued him.  You'll be the hero of Miami Metro.  I guess I fucking will.  What about your knives? I've got a plane to catch.  Do you want me to send them to you? Leave them as evidence.  Say you found them in the cabinet.    People will think they're Saxon's.    Let them.  Give him even more credit than he deserves.  Once I get settled, I'm gonna figure out a way to get in touch.    Dexter     My car, I'll leave it at the airport.    Dexter.    And   What? You could at least fucking hug me.  This is just for right now.  It's not forever.  I know that, fuckface.  Go get on a plane.  I will.  Are you sure about this, Dexter? I am.  I never thought this day would come.  You don't need me anymore.  This is Debra Morgan requesting backup at the Rendell Psychiatric Hospital in Allapattah.  What the fuck is going on here? Help me, please! I was abducted by the man who was just here.    Did you see him?   I didn't see anybody.  Get me out of here, please, before he comes back.  I thought I was gonna die.  Thank God you came here.  Don't move.  This is Detective Debra Morgan.  I've been shot.  Please send help.  I used to live my life at night.  In the shadow of my dark passenger.  I lived in shadows for so long until the dark became my world.  But over time, the people in my life flipped on a light.  At first I was blinded, it was so bright.  But over the years, my eyes adjusted and I could see.  And now what's in focus is my future.  Bright.  Brighter than it's ever been.      Previous EpisodeNext Episode"

The Brain Surgeon is related to you.  Daniel.  He's going by the name Oliver Saxon.  What are you going to do? What do you think? He's my son.  I still have feelings for you.  No, I just   Remember me? Where do you think you'll go? I haven't decided.  Argentina.  Me, you and Harrison are gonna move to Argentina.

Come on, you promised to help me count.  Two hundred ten.  There you go.  I always thought if I ever left Miami, I'd be running for my life, not running towards a new one.  Two hundred and eleven.  Heh.  Ladies and gentlemen, we'll begin boarding Flight 691 to Rio de Janeiro in a few moments.  We ask that you have your tickets and passports ready for the attendant.  Where's Hannah? Hannah? Hey, where are you? I'm at the gate.  Where are you? I'm in the ladies' room.  Elway is in the boarding area.  Come here, buddy.  Attention, passengers: We will begin pre boarding for Aero Sudamerica Flight 691 to Rio de Janeiro.  He didn't see me.  Did he see you? I don't think so.  He's got a clear view of the Jetway.  He must have bought a ticket.  We won't be able to board without being spotted.  And he's right between you and the exit.  Dex, I just heard them.  Our plane is boarding right now.  Stay where you are.  I'll call you back.  Okay.  Hey.  You want some Oreos? Yay! Come on.  Why don't you grab something for the flight? Nothing too big.  Okay.  The storm is coming fast.  We'll now be boarding all passengers in business class.  All passengers in business class, please make your way toward the gate.  Hey, excuse me.  Hi.  I have, uh, tickets on this flight.  I'm a forensic analyst, Miami Metro.  Yes? I don't wanna tell you how to do your job, but I just saw a guy drop that bag under that chair and then just walk away.  I thought he forgot it, but it really looked like he left it there on purpose.  Did you see where he went? Yeah, he's right over there, on the phone.  I know it's probably nothing, but like they say: \"If you see something, say something. \" Thanks.  Security, this is Casey at Gate 211.  There's a Caucasian male who just came in with a backpack Deputy marshal, it's Elway again.  I'm still at the airport.  I still think Hannah McKay's trying to leave the country.  Call me as soon as you can.  Thank you.  Sir.  Airport security.  Need you to come with us, please.  What? What happened? Just gotta ask you a few questions.  What is this about? I'll miss my flight.  Sir, I need you to do what I ask.  This way.  You gotta be fucking kidding me.  Hey.  Hey, the coast is clear.  Elway's gone.  Okay.  Due to a security concern Let's go see Hannah.  it is necessary at this time for all passengers to exit the boarding area Clear this area right now.  What did you do? Put Elway on the no fly list.  Unfortunately, now we're not flying either.  Come on, bud.  All right, let's move her.  Stabbed in the heart.  Pretty quick.  Unh.  His gun is missing too.  We can assume Saxon still has it.  I'm calling your brother.  No, he's leaving with Harrison.  If you tell him, he'll stay.  Deb   I swear to God, I'm not getting on that ambulance if you call.  Okay.  Can I ride with you to the hospital? No problem.  Do not argue with me.  I'm in the ambulance.  You're such a fucking asshole.  Yeah, he signed it.  I'll meet you at the hospital.  I'm right behind you.  Miami Central, this is Rescue 6 for transport You're all right.  Hurts like a motherfucker.  Ohh You know, I really hate getting shot.  You need to stop that.  Unh.  I really thought that was it.  I thought I was gonna die, heh.  No.  You're gonna live forever.  I thought maybe I was getting what I deserved.  What you deserve? Why would you think that? I've done shit I'm not proud of.  Stuff I can't take back.  Think I haven't done shit I'm not proud of? No.  It's not the same.  I know.  You went through a bad time.  But I fucked up too, Deb.  A lot.  But I think we get to make up for it, you know? How? You do enough good in the world, it sort of cancels out the bad.  I think I would need to save a busload of nuns or something.  You're a good person.  A lot better than most.  Now that you're back on the force, you're gonna have a million chances to do good.  Maybe even save that busload of nuns.  If they're like the ones I had in school, let them go.  Come here.  Hey.  I'm gonna be right here, okay? We both are.  Her vitals are stable.  Let's get her into surgery.  I love you, Joey.  What's that? So? She's on her way to surgery now.  She took one in the gut.  We don't know how bad it is yet.  Where's Dexter? Deb asked us not to call him.  She what? He's on a trip with Harrison.  She didn't wanna worry him.  But he's gotta know.  Damn right he's gotta know.  Due to a possible security concern, we are evacuating the terminal.  It's Matthews.  Hello? Dexter, Saxon escaped after shooting Debra.  No.  Well, thank you for telling me.  I'll be right there.  What's wrong? It's Debra.  What? Come on, bud.  Saxon shot her and got away.  Is she okay? She's in the hospital getting ready to go into surgery.  Is Aunt Deb sick? Just a little.  But the doctors are fixing her up right now.  You need to go to her.  I'll take you back to the hotel.  We should fly into a different country.  They're only gonna hold Elway so long.  He's gonna hit all the flights to Rio.  There may not be more flights.  I heard they were gonna close the airport to wait out the storm.  Leave from another city.  See what you can find online.  What about you? I'll join you when I can.  But   Don't worry.  We'll make this work.  One bag of ice and one gallon of water.    Can I get one more?   Only one bag.  Hi, Jamie.  Hey, Harrison.  So tell me all about your adventures How is she? Still in surgery.  Yeah, we weren't able to speak to the doctor before she went in.  Your sister's tough.  Just like your old man was.  Yeah, Dex.  She's gonna pull through.  Due to severe weather This is Deputy U. S.  Marshal Clayton.  Please leave your name and number.  Clayton, it's Elway.  Again.  I don't know where you are, but I'll tell you this: McKay's still in town.  With the flights cancelled, I'm sure she's looking for another way out.  I put the word out to my contacts, and with what I pay these people, if she walks through a hotel, a car rental agency, a bus, I'm gonna hear about that shit.  All right.  I'll try you at your field office, see if I can get you there.  U. S.  Marshals Service.  How may I direct your call? Yeah, this is Jacob Elway.  I've been working with Deputy Marshal Clayton.  I've been trying like hell   I guess you haven't heard the news.  What? Clayton was involved in a shooting.  I'm afraid he was killed in the line of duty.  Why aren't you in Argentina? Why do you think? I told them not to call you.  Well, I'm glad they did.  How come we never went hiking when we were kids? Hiking? Climbing mountains.  Hiking.  I don't know.  Because it's hard to find a mountain in Florida? There are mountains in South America.  All over the place.  Why are you looking at me like that? Or is that just your face? I should never have left Saxon alive.  It's not your fault.  Clayton fucked everything up.  Bad luck.  No, it's more than that.  Ever since you found out who I am I've screwed up your life, Deb.  It's not yours to screw up, Dexter.  I am responsible for my life.  Do you hear me? I don't want you to feel guilty about this.  I don't want you to feel guilty about anything.  You hear me? You were meant to be happy, so you need to go fucking be happy.  Okay.  Hello there.  Dr.  Kruper.  Dexter.  I'm Debra's brother.  Oh, nice to meet you.  Okay, I'm just gonna check your stomach.  So how are you feeling otherwise? I wanna go hiking.  I wouldn't recommend that for at least a few hours.  How is she? That bullet bounced around quite a bit.  But it missed hitting anything important.  You are very lucky.  So she's gonna be all right? There is a lot of recovery time ahead.  But I'd say we're looking pretty good.  I'm optimistic.  Thank you.  Mm hm.  I bet Hannah loves Argentina.  Pretty blond, lots of attention.  Just her thing.  Hannah didn't make the flight.  Elway was there, and we had to lose him.  That's my fault, Dex.  I put him on her.  That rat face fuck.  I'm sorry.  No, don't start blaming yourself.  Coming from Mr.  \"I screwed up your life, Deb. \" I need to find another way for Hannah to get out of the country.  I'm thinking of sending Harrison with her now and meeting up with them after you get out and Saxon is taken care of.  You heard the doctor.  I'm fine.  You should go.  We'll get Saxon.  No.  Dex, we'll get him.  Your life is waiting on you.  You should leave.  Deb The next word I wanna hear you say is \"goodbye. \" Say it already, or I'll crawl out of this bed and kick your fucking ass.  Goodbye.  I'll see you soon.  How's Aunt Deb? Can I see her? Oh, she needs to rest.  But she's gonna come visit us real soon.  Hey, did you know that this is the hospital where you were born? Really? Yeah.  Right down there.  It was the first time I saw you.  I was with Aunt Deb.  Holy fucking shit.  There's another Morgan now.  Yeah.  Congratulations.  You're a father.  Yeah, and you're an aunt.  Jesus.  Did you and Rita land on a name yet? Harrison.  Dad would love that.  Harrison.  I wanna hold him.  Which one is yours? I, um That's your son.  Do you wanna hold him? Yeah, I wanna hold him.  He's sleeping.  Let him sleep.  He has his whole fucking life to sleep.  He's so small.  Don't worry.  He'll grow.  How does it feel to be a father? I have no idea.  Heh.  Everything's gonna be different now.  I know.  Hey, thanks for your call.  No problem.  How's Debra? The doctor's optimistic.  That's good to hear.  Dexter, if there's anything I can do Well, I'm probably being paranoid, but Saxon is still out there.  Think you could put a couple unis on her room? I'm already on it.  Thanks.  No problem.  Hey.  Hey, I just heard about Deb.  What happened? Uh, it's a long story.  I don't really have time to go into it.  In a hurry to get back to Hannah McKay? I don't know what you're talking about.  That's why Clayton was following Deb.  Figured she was helping you and Hannah leave the country.  You're partially responsible for his death.  Just stay away from me.  Storm's coming, buddy.  And it's gonna be real hard to find a way out.  Don't go down with her, Dexter.  Son of a bitch.  The National Hurricane Centre is reporting that Laura is now just east of Cuba with sustained winds topping 100 miles per hour.  If it keeps on this current course, it could hit the Keys by sundown.  Shh.  It's okay.  Hurricane Laura shows no signs of slowing down.  Hey.  It's okay.  It's okay.  Hey, we're closed.  Only reason I'm here is to keep the animals calm to   Stitch me up.  Okay.  Okay, I'll do whatever you need.  Miami's entire coast is being evacuated, so we can use the craziness to get out of here without being spotted.  They're lining up evacuation buses.  The bus? The highways are parking lots.  Buses have their own lanes.  We can take one all the way up to Jacksonville and fly out from there.  We'd better leave for the bus station soon if we're gonna make it on time.  What is it? Nothing.  It's a good plan.  You're still worried about Deb, aren't you? The doctor said she's out of danger.  Hey, we can, uh We can stick around, you know, ride out the storm here.  It's not safe with Elway on the hunt.  You need to get out of here, the faster the better.  Well, I could leave now and you could meet me there.  I could even take Harrison with me.  Or I could, um, go alone.  I have no problem with you taking Harrison.  I'd be happy to know that he's with you.  It's that I don't wanna lose you again.  Even if it's just for a couple of days.    as well as Cuba and Grand Cayman Island.  We're staying with you through the morning and into the night Hurry up.  Tropical Storm Laura is picking up speed Almost finished.  One more stitch.  The storm is threatening the coast sometime in the next few days, according to the National Hurricane Centre.  Many local residents are already preparing for the storm.  As the storm comes in, it's important that people stay in their homes and off the highways.  There's going to be a lot of wind and rain.  It's going to be over the next few Please.  Just go.  I won't say anything to anyone.    for this special report about one of Miami's finest, Debra Morgan.  That's her.  I'm here at Miami Central Hospital, where a detective with Miami Metro is recovering from surgery after having been shot.  We have learned that a deputy marshal died on the scene.  The suspect, Oliver Saxon, is still at large, and may have carjacked a blue pickup truck.  If you have any information about Get your car keys.  We're taking a drive.  Can't you just let me go? Do what I said, and you won't get hurt.  Mockingbird Bus 24 from Miami to Tallahassee All right, keep it moving.  No pushing.  WOMAN Oh, no, it's okay.  Wait.  Come here.  All right, everyone, please keep moving the line.  It's Saxon.  He's still out there.  I can't leave until he's caught, until Debra is safe.  I'm sorry.  You need to get back in line.  It's okay.  I understand.  Here.  Take Harrison.  I'll meet you down there.  You sure? Yeah.  He'll be safer with you.  Take this.  It's just water, snacks.  A few essentials.  Call me from the airport as soon as you know that you made your flight.  I will.  No one will be allowed to board without a ticket.  Harrison, you're gonna leave with Hannah.  You're not coming with us? No, of course I am.  I just forgot a few things I need to take care of.  As soon as I do, I'll meet you there, I promise.  I'm gonna miss you.  It's just for a little while.  It'll be fun.  We're all going to this cool place, and you're gonna get there first, okay? Now, I want you to mind Hannah.  You do what she says.  You know what, Daddy? What? I love Hannah.  So do I.  I'll see you in Buenos Aires.  We'll be waiting.  This is the final boarding call for Mockingbird Bus 24 to Tallahassee.  Come on, Harrison.  I'll check on Deb, and then I'll deal with Saxon.  This is the hospital.  I've done everything you've asked.  I just wanna go home.  So this is it.  I promise, I won't say a word to anyone.  No, I know.  We need a doctor over here! Let me get that.  He's choking.  I need a suction canister.  Right away.    Doctor?   Jesus.  His tongue, it's been cut out.  Let's get him to the OR.  My God, why would anyone cut his tongue out? All eyes on the victim.  The perfect distraction.  Saxon.  In order to conserve power, the south wing has been closed.  At this time, we ask all visitors to make their way towards the exit in the north wing.  All surgical staff are to report to their current assignments.  Drop it.  Drop it.  We got this, Dex.  Quinn? Dex, I Where's Deb? I don't know.  Something went wrong.  There was a problem, and they rushed her to the ICU.  What happened? They're working on her now.  Um She stopped breathing.  Mr.  Morgan, I'm afraid I don't have good news.  There were complications.  What kind of complications? We think a clot formed during surgery that triggered a major stroke.  Debra's brain was deprived of oxygen for a period of time.  What do you mean? You said she was gonna be fine.  I had hoped so.  I'm very sorry.  Is she going to recover? It's possible that she could breathe on her own, but she won't be able to eat without a feeding tube, and according to the brain scans, she won't be able to think, reason, or even know that you're there.  Now, we've intubated her, and I've lowered her body temperature so that we can preserve as much brain function as possible.  You don't know Deb.  She'll   She'll pull through this.  You hear about miracles all the time.  Well, that's just it, I'm afraid.  It would be a miracle.  I've never seen a miracle.  Hello, Harrison.  Wow.  He's so fucking small.  I'll have to watch what I say around you, little man.  Heh.  Don't you wanna hold your son? You won't break him.  Heh.  Okay.  Talk to him.  Hello, Harrison.  See? He knows you.  I don't know how to do this.  Just keep his head up.  No, I mean everything.  How to be a father, how to take care of him.  You'll be great.  How do you know? Because you've always taken care of me.  I have? Ever since we were little.  Don't you remember the monsters? Uh, no.  Every time Mom turned off the lights, they'd be running all over the walls.  I couldn't fucking go to sleep.  I thought they were gonna eat me or something.  I don't remember.  They were the shadows.  You came in and explained it in your dorky little voice.  \"Oh, it's just the absence of light, Deb. \" Heh.  I don't even know why I remember that, but I do.  And even then, you stayed in my room and slept on the floor by my bed.  You made me feel so fucking safe.  You were always taking care of me.  You're gonna be a great father, because you've always been a great big brother.  You really believe that? With all my heart.  You were so wrong, Deb.  Tell me about Argentina.  Well, uh, they have their own special kind of cowboys.  They're called gauchos.  Maybe you'll get to meet one.  You know what else they have? Penguins.  I like penguins.  They're not just in a zoo.  They're wild ones, kind of roaming around because Argentina is close to the South Pole, which is where Santa Claus has his summer home, and And because he's on vacation, he's always in a good mood, so he says yes to everything.  Who knew you'd be so good with kids, huh? How did you find me? One of my contacts finally came through.  Look, let's be civil about this, all right? No need to upset Harrison.  All right, please take your seats.  We're pulling out now.  Next stop, Daytona.  So this is what's gonna happen.  We're gonna sit here quietly until we get to Daytona.  Then we're gonna very calmly get off the bus.  I'm gonna drive us to the marshals field office, turn you in and hand Harrison over to Child Protective Services.  And I'm gonna collect what's turning out to be a very hard earned reward.  Dex, we're gonna nail this asshole to the wall, I promise you.  For Deb.  Oliver Saxon.  Or would you prefer to be called by your given name, Daniel Vogel? You know, there are several ways we can do this.  Given that we have footage of you killing other people, it would be in your best interest to cooperate.  It's up to my lawyer how cooperative I am.  Are you sure? Because if you have any hope of staying out of the electric chair, you should probably start talking.  Just fucking admit it.  You killed Cassie, you killed Clayton, and you shot Deb.  How did you hurt your arm? This? It's just a scratch.  No.  Deb's a good shot.  Who's Deb? Fuck you! You fucking shot her! And you left her there to die! Just like you killed your mother and left her to die, you fucking piece of shit! Quinn.  Out.  I'd like to, uh, speak to my attorney, please.  You know, he was right about one thing.  You are a fucking piece of shit.  Batista and Quinn will be able to make a case against Saxon.  I could leave now for Argentina and let the state of Florida kill him.  Folks, we will be arriving at the Daytona station momentarily.  After a short stop, we will proceed on to Tallahassee.  Anyone making a connection to Jacksonville should disembark and proceed to Boarding Bay 3.  Hey, hey.  I'm just getting some tea.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Do you want some? How stupid do you think I am? Here's what's gonna happen.  The horse tranquilliser I just gave you is gonna kick in in eight seconds.  You're gonna fall asleep and wake up in Tallahassee with a slight headache, feeling humiliated and cranky.  Come on, sweetie.  It's time to go.  Let's go.  Come on.  Hi.  I'm here to do a GSR test on Oliver Saxon? Sign in, please.  Would you like an officer with you? No, I'm good.  Okay.  Hit this button if you need us.  Got it.  I wish I could blame you for everything.  For what you did to my sister.  But I know it's all my fault.  Should have walked away.  You know, what you've actually done is opened my eyes.  Forced me to look at myself.  And what do you see? A trail of blood and body parts.  What a pretty picture.  In one sharp moment, you took away this foolish dream that I could have a happy life.  Is that why you're here? To tell me all this? No, I'm here to kill you with that pen.  In here.  You all right? He tried to kill me.  Dexter help me out here.  What were you doing with Saxon? I went in to do a GSR test.  But you don't even work here anymore.  How are we gonna explain this? I'm officially here till the end of the week.  Okay, but why would you personally do this test? After what he did to Deb   It's exactly because of what he did to Deb that I went in there.  I wanted to make sure everything was handled perfectly, by the book, no mistakes.  And I wanted to look him in the eye.  Okay.  I get that.  It's obviously self defence.  Yeah.  We got everything we need.  I'm glad he's dead.  I wish I could have done it myself.  You should go, Dex.  I know that you have a lot to deal with.  Yes.  Hey.  I'm praying for her.  As much as I may have pretended otherwise, for so long, all I wanted was to be like other people, to feel what they felt.  But now that I do, I just want it to stop.

We have to consolidate space and power.    at 150 miles per hour.  It has been elevated to Category 3.  At this time, all staff must report to their preassigned stations.  I would change everything if I could.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  But I can't leave you like this.  I'm your big brother.  I love you, Deb.  Dexter.  Hey, where are you? At the airport, about to board.  We're gonna make it.  That's great.  Where are you? I'm still in Miami.  But I'm gonna be leaving soon.  I can't believe this is actually gonna happen.  Once we get there, we should start making our way south.  They have 3000 miles of coastline.  We can just keep going until we find the perfect spot, or maybe some penguins.  That sounds great.  I am so happy right now, Dex.  Me too.  Do you wanna talk to Harrison? Please.  Okay, here.  Hi, Daddy.  Hi, Harrison.  I just wanna tell you one last time that I love you.  I love you too.  I want you to remember that every single day until I see you again.  Daddy loves you.  Okay.  Bye.  I destroy everyone I love.  And I can't let that happen to Hannah, to Harrison.  I have to protect them from me.  Good morning, Miami.  Hurricane Laura has passed.  Everything is going back to normal.  There is no longer any threat.
